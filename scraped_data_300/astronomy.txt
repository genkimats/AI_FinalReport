A search for the very rare\(B^{*0}\rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-\)and\(B_{s}^{*0}\rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-\)decays is conducted by analysing the\(B_c^+\rightarrow \pi ^+\mu ^+\mu ^-\)process. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data collected with the LHCb detector between 2011 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9\(\text {\,fb}^{-1}\). The signal signatures correspond to simultaneous peaks in the\(\mu ^+\mu ^-\)and\(\pi ^+\mu ^+\mu ^-\)invariant masses. No evidence for an excess of events over background is observed for either signal decay mode. Upper limits at the\(90\%\)confidence level are set on the branching fractions relative to that for\(B_c^+\rightarrow J\hspace{-1.66656pt}/\hspace{-1.111pt}\psi \pi ^+\)decays,$$\begin{aligned} \mathcal{R}_{B^{*0}(\mu ^+\mu ^-)\pi ^+/J\hspace{-1.66656pt}/\hspace{-1.111pt}\psi \pi ^+}&< 3.8\times 10^{-5}\ \text { and }\\ \mathcal{R}_{B_{s}^{*0}(\mu ^+\mu ^-)\pi ^+/J\hspace{-1.66656pt}/\hspace{-1.111pt}\psi \pi ^+}&< 5.0\times 10^{-5}. \end{aligned}$$
There were at least seven attempts to calculate critical radii for reactors or bombs 1939–1945. Those made by Flügge and Peierls in 1939 are compared with the calculations made by Perrin (1939), Heisenberg (1939 and 1945) and Serber (1943). Fermi’s 1942 reactor calculations are not covered here because that would call for a separate paper. Heisenberg calculated the critical radius formula and some critical radii in 1939 for a reactor. He focused on reactors 1939–45 and apparently did not make a bomb calculation before his August 1945 Farm Hall Lecture where he independently reproduced the 1943 Los Alamos Primer calculation for a bomb to within the limits that he knew the fast fission cross section. Flügge attempted a ponderous alternative to a critical radius calculation. Perrin’s calculation predates the Heisenberg and Serber calculations. His theoretical choice of tamper boundary condition was not optimal but his calculation method was correct. Peierls aimed to improve on Perrin's method but did worse. Finally, we calculate the 2.1 cm critical radius stated in the Frisch–Peierls Memorandum from Peierls’ model and graph, and we also show how Frisch and Peierls likely calculated it, including why Frisch assumed a fission cross section of 10 barn in his calculation.
The widely accepted accretion scenario of planet formation suggests that the Moon experienced a violent bombardment in its early history. The accretion scenario predicts that a total of ~300 basins with sizes greater than 300 km formed throughout its bombardment history; however, only ~40 basins of this size are identified on the Moon. The cause for this notable discrepancy is unknown. Here we investigate the viscous relaxation of impact basins formed within ~150 Myr after the completion of lunar magma ocean (LMO) solidification, as only impacts that happened afterwards could be retained by the crust. We find that, owing to the high temperature of the lower crust, basins formed within ~100 Myr after the LMO solidification could have been sufficiently relaxed by lower crustal inflow to escape detection in gravitational and topographic data. By contrast, basins formed afterwards should have limited relaxation, as the cooler temperature of the lower crust inhibits the inflow. Our results show that, to have ~40 retained basins, the Moon would have had ~300–1,000 basin-forming impacts throughout its history and the LMO would have solidified ~4.3 Gyr ago. The temperature-dependent viscous relaxation of post-LMO basins provides a realistic explanation for the low number of basins observed on the Moon. The substantial relaxation of early basins suggests that terrestrial planets, which experienced crustal cooling after magma ocean solidification, may have suffered far more impacts than the basin records indicate.
In this paper, we have put forwarded a detailed investigation on the cosmic evolution of Bianchi type III model within the realm of Born-Infeldf(R) gravity executing the Palatini approach. Using a very eminent tool known as Dynamical System Approach (DSA), we have curtailed the complexity of the non linear field equations and study the dynamics for the form\(f(R) =R-\beta / R^n\). The main focus of our work is to retrieve the sequence of cosmic evolution and to study the evolution of shear as well as spatial curvature.
This article focuses on different anisotropic models within the framework of a specific modified\(f(\mathcal {R},\mathcal {T}, \mathcal {R}_{\zeta \gamma }\mathcal {T}^{\zeta \gamma })\)gravity theory. The study adopts a static spherically symmetric spacetime to determine the field equations for two different modified models: (i)\(f(\mathcal {R},\mathcal {T},\mathcal {R}_{\zeta \gamma }\mathcal {T}^{\zeta \gamma })=\mathcal {R}+\eta \mathcal {R}_{\zeta \gamma }\mathcal {T}^{\zeta \gamma }\), and (ii)\(f(\mathcal {R},\mathcal {T},\mathcal {R}_{\zeta \gamma }\mathcal {T}^{\zeta \gamma })=\mathcal {R}(1+\eta \mathcal {R}_{\zeta \gamma }\mathcal {T}^{\zeta \gamma })\), where\(\eta \)is a constant parameter. To address the additional degrees of freedom in the field equations and obtain their corresponding unique solution, the Durgapal-Fuloria spacetime geometry and MIT bag model are utilized. Matching conditions are applied to determine unknown constants within the chosen spacetime geometry. We adopt a certain range of model parameters to analyze the physical characteristics of the developed models in the interior distribution of a particular compact star candidate 4U 1820-30. Energy conditions and some other tests are also implemented to ensure their viability and stability. Additionally, the disappearing radial pressure constraint is employed to find the values of the model parameter, aligning with the observed information of an array of stars. The study concludes that both of our models are well-behaved and satisfy all necessary conditions, and thus we observe them suitable for the modeling of astrophysical objects.
The SNO\(+\)collaboration reports its first spectral analysis of long-baseline reactor antineutrino oscillation using 114 tonne-years of data. Fitting the neutrino oscillation probability to the observed energy spectrum yields constraints on the neutrino mass-squared difference\(\Delta m^2_{21}\). In the ranges allowed by previous measurements, the best-fit\(\Delta m^2_{21}\)is (\(8.85^{+1.10}_{-1.33}\))\(\times \)\(10^{-5}\)\(\hbox {eV}^2\). This measurement is continuing in the next phases of SNO+ and is expected to surpass the present global precision on\(\Delta m^2_{21}\)with about three years of data.
This study deals with the new class of embedded wormhole solutions in the background of general relativity. Two newly calculated wormhole solutions satisfy  all the required properties. The embedded diagrams for both calculated wormhole solutions are provided. All the energy conditions are discussed through their validity regions for the different ranges of involved parameters. In maximum regions, all energy conditions are violated. We investigate the shadow and strong gravitational lensing by the wormhole throat for the two new wormhole models, namely Model-I and Model-II. The present paper considers the wormhole throat to act as a photon sphere. We first derive null geodesics using the Hamilton-Jacobi separation method to investigate the shadow and strong gravitational lensing caused by the wormhole throat. We then numerically obtain the radius of wormhole shadow, strong deflection angle, and various lensing observables by taking the example of supermassive black M87* and Sgr A* in the context of both Model-I and Model-II. Keeping all other parameters fixed, it is observed that the parameters\(\zeta _1\)and\(\zeta _2\)for Model-I; and\(\chi _1\)and\(\chi _2\)for Model-II have significant effects on the wormhole shadow and strong gravitational lensing phenomena. Our conclusion is that it is possible to detect relativistic images, such as Einstein rings, produced by wormholes with throat radii of\(r_{th}=3M\). The stability analysis via Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkov equation is included for both wormhole solutions. Additionally, current technology enables us to test hypotheses related to astrophysical wormholes.
We study the dynamics of a charged radiating star in general relativity. The junction conditions at the surface of the star lead to a restriction that connects the radial pressure to the heat flux. The master equation reduces to a nonlinear second order differential equation which determines the temporal evolution. The dynamical behaviour is studied via a phase plane analysis which reveals interesting behaviour. The presence of both the electromagnetic field and the cosmological constant are included in our treatment. They affect the temporal evolution of the gravitating star. We identify the restrictions on the parameters that lead to a stable asymptotic end state of the star.
The dynamic properties of molecular clouds are set by the interplay of their self-gravity, turbulence, external pressure and magnetic fields. Extended surveys of Galactic molecular clouds typically find that their kinetic energy (Ek) counterbalances their self-gravitational energy (Eg), setting their virial parameterαvir= 2Ek/∣Eg∣≈ 1. However, past studies either have been biased by the use of optically thick lines or have been limited within the solar neighbourhood and the inner Galaxy (Galactocentric radiusRgc<Rgc,⊙≈ 8 kpc). Here we present sensitive mapping observations of optically thin13CO lines towards molecular clouds in the low-metallicity Galactic outer disk (Rgc~ 9–24 kpc). By combining archival data from the inner Galaxy and four nearby metal-poor dwarf galaxies, we reveal a systematic trend ofαvir, which declines from supervirial dynamic states in metal-rich clouds to extremely subvirial dynamic states in metal-poor clouds. In these metal-poor environments, turbulence alone is insufficient to counterbalance the self-gravity of a cloud. A cloud-volumetric magnetic field may replace turbulence as the dominant cloud-supporting mechanism in low-metallicity conditions, for example, the outermost galactic disks, dwarf galaxies and galaxies in the early Universe, which would then inevitably impact the initial conditions for star formation in such environments.
We determine the uncorrelated modes that characterize the fluctuations in a semi-realistic model for the initial state of high-energy nuclear collisions, consisting of hot spots whose positions are distributed independently. Varying the number of hot spots, their size, and the weights with which they contribute to the initial state, we find that the parameter that has the largest influence on the relative importance of the fluctuation modes is the source size, with more extended hot spots leading to a more marked predominance of the principal modes.
In this paper, the light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the\(\rho \)meson are evaluated in the framework of the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model using the proper time regularization scheme. The transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of the\(\rho \)meson are derived from the overlap representations of the LFWFs. We investigate the\(\varvec{k}_{\perp }\)-weighted moments and thex-dependent average transverse momentum\(\langle k_{\perp }^n(x)\rangle _{\alpha }\)of\(\rho \)meson TMDs. The\(\langle k_{\perp }^n(x)\rangle _{\alpha }\)shows the typical transverse momenta of quark TMDs in our model. Our findings indicate that the average transverse momenta of\(\langle k_{\perp }(x)\rangle _{\alpha }\)fall within the range of [0.3, 0.45] GeV, while\(\langle k_{\perp }^2(x)\rangle _{\alpha }\)are in the region of [0.15, 0.30]\(GeV^2\). Our TMDs and parton distribution functions (PDFs) exhibit excellent adherence to positive constraints. The investigation of spin densities within the\(\rho \)meson in transverse momentum space reveals axially symmetric distributions for quarks and targets polarized in either the longitudinal or transverse direction. Conversely, unpolarized symmetric distributions occur when the quark is longitudinally polarized and the target is transversely polarized, while exhibiting dipolar distortions in the opposite scenario. A comparison between TMDs from LFWFs and those from a covariant approach demonstrates that TMDs from LFWFs more effectively satisfy positive constraints than their counterparts from the covariant approach. Furthermore, thex-moments of\(\rho \)meson PDFs indicate that\(\langle x\rangle _{g_L}\)is larger using LFWFs than with the covariant approach. Additionally, analysis of quark spin densities within the\(\rho \)meson reveals that\(\rho _{\uparrow \downarrow }\left( k_x,k_y\right) =f-g_L-\frac{1}{3}f_{LL}\)yields a negative result using the covariant approach, whereas\(\rho _{\uparrow \downarrow }\left( k_x,k_y\right) \)derived from LFWFs produces a positive outcome.
The very high luminosity run foreseen at theZ-pole for the FCC-ee will allow the detection inZdecays of new particles  with very low couplings to the Standard Model. These particles can have measurable flight paths before they decay. If the timing and the position of the decay vertex can be measured with high precision, the mass of such particles can be measured by exploiting the constrained kinematics of an\(e^+e^-\)collider. The mass resolution achievable with this technique is studied through a detailed analysis in the framework of a parametrised simulation of the performance of the IDEA detector. The adopted benchmark model is the production of Heavy Neutral Leptons, which is one of the key channels for new physics discovery at the FCC-ee.
AMoRE-II aims to search for neutrinoless double beta decay (\(0\nu \beta \beta \)) with an array of 423\(\hbox {Li}_2^{100}\hbox {MoO}_4\)crystals operating in the cryogenic system as the main phase of the Advanced Molybdenum-based Rare process Experiment (AMoRE). AMoRE has been planned to operate in three phases: AMoRE-pilot, AMoRE-I, and AMoRE-II. AMoRE-II is currently being installed at the Yemi Underground Laboratory, located approximately 1000 m deep in Jeongseon, Korea. The goal of the experiment is to reach an exclusion half-life sensitivity to the\(0\nu \beta \beta \)of\(^{100}\)Mo on the level of\(T^{0\nu \beta \beta }_{1/2} > 6 \times 10^{26}\)year that covers completely the inverted Majorana neutrino mass hierarchy region of (15–46) meV. To achieve this, the background level of the experimental configurations and possible background sources of gamma and beta events should be well understood. We have intensively performed Monte Carlo simulations using the GEANT4 toolkit in all the experimental configurations with potential sources. We report the estimated background level that meets the\(10^{-4}\)counts/(keV\(\cdot \)kg\(\cdot \)year) requirement for AMoRE-II in the Region Of Interest (ROI) and show the projected half-life sensitivity based on the simulation study.
Exoplanets and smaller bodies have been detected orbiting different kind of stars. However, we do not know of any such objects in planetary nebulae, the short-lived stage of stellar evolution between the asymptotic giant branch and white dwarf phases. The planetary activity (destruction and formation) may be accompanied by dust clouds. Hence, we searched for dust occultation events in planetary nebulae using archival photometric data. We show that the central star of PN WeSb 1 features numerous dimming events with typical durations of a few days to weeks that are up to 3 mag deep. This variability is mainly stochastic with an indication of a 400 d period. The occultations are almost grey, indicating dust grains larger than about 0.1 μm. Based on our follow-up observations, we argue that the central star is a wide binary and that these events are most probably caused by debris from disintegrated small rocky bodies that escaped from the former asymptotic giant branch star to find safe harbour around the companion star. The latter star dominates the optical spectrum enabling us to see the eclipses. This means that planetary systems are present and undergo violent evolution during the planetary nebula stage.
The work investigates absorption of a twisted photon, which possesses quantized total angular momentum (TAM), by a relativistic electron with the Lorentz factor\(\displaystyle \gamma \sim 1{-}10\)in a strong magnetic field up to the Schwinger limit,\(\displaystyle H_c = 4.4\cdot 10^{13}\)G. We examine the absorption cross sections and their dependence on the parameters of the incident photon and the initial Landau electron. It is found that total absorption cross sections decrease as angular momentum of the incident photon increases and increase as angular momentum of the initial electron grows. The process is also compared across different magnetic field strengths, and the contribution of various electron spin transitions to total absorption cross section is analyzed. We also find that the processes without an electron spin flip dominate and, on top of that, an asymmetry in the “spin-down”\(\displaystyle \rightarrow \)“spin-up” and the “spin-up”\(\displaystyle \rightarrow \)“spin-down” transitions is observed. Specifically, the cross sections for the “spin-down”\(\displaystyle \rightarrow \)“spin-up” transition are larger, which can be interpreted as an analogy of the Sokolov–Ternov effect present for photon emission. Finally, the cross sections are found to be almost constant as the transverse momentum of the photon varies from 0.1 eV to 100 keV. Our findings can help to improve the understanding of the QED processes in critical fields, typical for astrophysical environments, e.g. magnetospheres of neutron stars.
We consider T-dualities arising from global symmetries in two dimensional Gauged Linear Sigma Models (GLSMs). The model has\(\mathcal {N}=(2,2)\)supersymmetry,U(1) gauge group, and leads to the susy vacuum of the resolved conifold. It possesses the non-Abelian global symmetry\(SU(2) \times SU(2)\). A non-Abelian T-duality can be constructed, which can be described by gauging the global non-Abelian symmetry. This leads to a dual action, in terms of the dual model’s Kähler and superpotential terms, which include a dependence on twisted chiral superfields. The effective superpotentials for theU(1) vector superfield in the original and dual models are matched, determining the instanton corrections of the dual action. This is an important observable in the UV regime, which establishes the duality. We obtain the supersymmetry vacuum solution of the dual model in three cases: first, in an Abelian direction inside\(SU(2) \times SU(2)\); second, for an Abelian direction considering instanton corrections; and finally, for a semi-chiral non-Abelian vector superfield. The dual geometry for the cases without instanton corrections (SUSY vacuum space) is given by\(T^5 \times \mathbb {R}\). For the duality with instanton corrections, one obtains the vacuum space\(T^3 \times \mathbb {R}^2\), and with IR modifications to the twisted superpotential, one obtains a 3-fold given as a cubic polynomial on\((\mathbb {C}^{\times })^3 \times \mathbb {C}\). We discuss the\(U(1)_A\)axial R-symmetry in the dual model and its possible role.
Extended dark matter objects (EDOs) are popular dark matter candidates that interact gravitationally with the Standard Model. These gravitational interactions can be used to constrain their allowed parameter space. However, EDOs can have different formation mechanisms, sizes, and shapes, requiring a case-by-case analysis when studying their impact on different areas of cosmology. We thus present arepositoryof all available bounds for these objects, with a code that allows plotting user-defined combinations of all up-to-date bounds for a given shape and different radii. We propose a standard for the EDOs’ mass profiles so that different sets of bounds are consistent with each other, and provide instructions on using the code and contributing to the repository.
Charged-particle trajectories are usually reconstructed with the LHCb detector using combined information from the tracking devices placed upstream and downstream of the 4 T m dipole magnet. Trajectories reconstructed using only information from the tracker downstream of the dipole magnet, which are referred to as T tracks, have not been used for physics analysis to date. The challenges of the reconstruction of long-lived particles with T tracks for physics use are discussed and solutions are proposed. The feasibility and the tracking performance are studied using samples of long-lived\(\varvec{\Lambda }\)and\(K_S^0\)hadrons decaying between 6.0 and 7.6 m downstream of the proton–proton collision point, thereby traversing most of the magnetic field region and providing maximal sensitivity to magnetic and electric dipole moments. The reconstruction can be expanded upstream to about 2.5 m for use in direct searches of exotic long-lived particles. The data used in this analysis have been recorded between 2015 and 2018 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 6\(\hbox {fb}^{-1}\). The results obtained demonstrate the possibility to further extend the decay volume and the physics reach of the LHCb experiment.
Strong gravitational magnification enables the detection of faint background sources and allows researchers to resolve their internal structures and even identify individual stars in distant galaxies. Highly magnified individual stars are useful in various applications, including studies of stellar populations in distant galaxies and constraining dark matter structures in the lensing plane. However, these applications have been hampered by the small number of individual stars observed, as typically one or a few stars are identified from each distant galaxy. Here, we report the discovery of more than 40 microlensed stars in a single galaxy behind Abell 370 at redshift of 0.725 (dubbed ‘the Dragon arc’) when the Universe was half of its current age, using James Webb Space Telescope observations with the time-domain technique. These events were found near the expected lensing critical curves, suggesting that these are magnified stars that appear as transients from intracluster stellar microlenses. Through multi-wavelength photometry, we constrained their stellar types and found that many of them are consistent with red giants or supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds. This finding reveals a high occurrence of microlensing events in the Dragon arc and demonstrates that time-domain observations by the James Webb Space Telescope could lead to the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.
Numerous non-standard interactions between neutrinos and scalar fields have been suggested in the literature. In this work, we have outlined the case of tensorial neutrino non-standard interactions with scalar fields, which can be related to the effective\(\textit{CPT}\)-even dimension-4 operators of the Standard Model Extension (SME). We illustrate how bounds placed on these parameters can be associated with limits on the energy scale of the proposed neutrino interactions with cosmic scalars. Besides, as a case study, we employ a DUNE-like experimental configuration to assess the projected sensitivities to the\(\textit{CPT}\)-even isotropic\(c_{\alpha \beta }\)andZ-spatial\(c_{\alpha \beta }^{ZZ}\)SME coefficients. For the case of the isotropic SME coefficients, an upper limit on the energy scale of the interaction can be placed. The current IceCube experiment and upcoming neutrino experiments such as DUNE, KM3NeT, IceCube-Gen2, and GRAND proposals, may clarify these classes of neutrino non-standard interactions.
We explore the decay of bound neutrons in the JUNO liquid scintillator detector into invisible particles (e.g.,\(n\rightarrow 3 \nu \)or\(nn \rightarrow 2 \nu \)), which do not produce an observable signal. The invisible decay includes two decay modes:\( n \rightarrow { inv} \)and\( nn \rightarrow { inv} \). The invisible decays ofs-shell neutrons in\(^{12}\textrm{C}\)will leave a highly excited residual nucleus. Subsequently, some de-excitation modes of the excited residual nuclei can produce a time- and space-correlated triple coincidence signal in the JUNO detector. Based on a full Monte Carlo simulation informed with the latest available data, we estimate all backgrounds, including inverse beta decay events of the reactor antineutrino\({\bar{\nu }}_e\), natural radioactivity, cosmogenic isotopes and neutral current interactions of atmospheric neutrinos. Pulse shape discrimination and multivariate analysis techniques are employed to further suppress backgrounds. With two years of exposure, JUNO is expected to give an order of magnitude improvement compared to the current best limits. After 10 years of data taking, the JUNO expected sensitivities at a 90% confidence level are\(\tau /B( n \rightarrow { inv} ) > 5.0 \times 10^{31} \, \textrm{years}\)and\(\tau /B( nn \rightarrow { inv} ) > 1.4 \times 10^{32} \, \textrm{years}\).
In this work, we address the question of how to enhance signal-agnostic searches by leveraging multiple testing strategies. Specifically, we consider hypothesis tests relying on machine learning, where model selection can introduce a bias towards specific families of new physics signals. Focusing on the New Physics Learning Machine, a methodology to perform a signal-agnostic likelihood-ratio test, we explore a number of approaches to multiple testing, such as combiningp-values and aggregating test statistics. Our findings show that it is beneficial to combine different tests, characterised by distinct choices of hyperparameters, and that performances comparable to the best available test are generally achieved, while also providing a more uniform response to various types of anomalies. This study proposes a methodology that is valid beyond machine learning approaches and could in principle be applied to a larger class model-agnostic analyses based on hypothesis testing.
In the conventional method of studying wormhole (WH) geometry, traversability requires the presence of exotic matter, which also provides negative gravity effects to keep the wormhole throat open. In de Rham–Gabadadze–Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory, we produce two types of WH solutions in our present paper. We obtain the field equations for exact WH solutions by selecting a static and spherically symmetric metric for the background geometry. We derive the WH geometry completely for the two different choices of redshift functions. The obtained WH solutions violate all the energy conditions, including the null energy condition (NEC). Various plots are used to illustrate the behavior of the wormhole for a suitable range of\(m^2c_1\), wheremis the graviton mass. It is observed that the photon deflection angle becomes negative for all values of\(m^2c_1\)as a result of the repulsive action of gravity. It is also shown that the repulsive impact of massive gravitons pushes the spacetime geometry so strongly that the asymptotic flatness is affected. The volume integral quantifier (VIQ) is computed to determine the amounts of matter that violate the null energy condition. The complexity factor of the proposed model is also discussed.
Cosmic rays (CRs) play a pivotal role in shaping the thermal and dynamical properties of astrophysical environments, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Recent observations suggest a stronger confinement of CRs in certain astrophysical systems than predicted by current CR-transport theories. Here, we show that the incorporation of microscale physics into CR-transport models can account for this enhanced CR confinement. We develop a theoretical description of the effect of magnetic microscale fluctuations originating from the mirror instability on macroscopic CR diffusion. We confirm our theory with large-dynamical-range simulations of CR transport in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters and kinetic simulations of CR transport in micromirror fields. We conclude that sub-teraelectronvolt CR confinement in the ICM is far more effective than previously anticipated on the basis of Galactic-transport extrapolations. The transformative impact of micromirrors on CR diffusion provides insights into how microphysics can reciprocally affect macroscopic dynamics and observable structures across a range of astrophysical scales.
A comprehensive extension of the ordinary 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), supplemented by vector-like quarks (VLQs), in the “alignment limit” is presented. In such a scenario, we study the possibility that large hadron collider (LHC) searches for VLQs can profile their nature too, i.e., whether they belong to a singlet, doublet, or triplet representation. To achieve this, we exploit both standard model (SM) decays of VLQs with top-(anti)quark electromagnetic (EM) charge (T), i.e., intob,tquarks and\(W^\pm , Z,h\)bosons (which turn out to be suppressed and henceTstates can escape existing limits) as well as their exotic decays, i.e., intob,t(and possiblyB) quarks and\(H^\pm , H, A\)bosons. We show that quite specific decay patterns emerge in the different VLQ representations so that, depending upon whichTsignals are accessed at the LHC, one may be able to ascertain the underlying beyond standard model (BSM) structure, especially if mass knowledge of the new fermionic and bosonic sectors can be inferred from (other) data.
In the presence of a transition magnetic moment between active and sterile neutrinos, sterile neutrinos could be produced by neutrino beams electromagnetically upscattering on nuclei. We study the active-sterile neutrino transition magnetic moment through this upscattering in the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process induced by solar neutrinos. We place new limits on the transition magnetic moment-sterile neutrino mass plane using the latest data from the CDEX-10 experiment. We also provide projected sensitivities for future measurements. We observe that the projected sensitivities could cover some regions of the parameter space which were previously unexplored for the sterile neutrino mass up to\(\sim 10\)MeV.
In this paper, we investigate one of the established methods for reconstructing modified gravity models from a dark energy model, with the aim of discovering relationships between these theories. In this study, we focus on thef(R,T) modified gravity theory, whereRdenotes the Ricci scalar andTrepresents the trace of the energy–momentum tensor. We employ Barrow’s holographic dark energy model, derived from fractal surfaces of black holes, to investigate the reconstruction process. The numerical results are subsequently presented for various infrared cutoffs, such as the Hubble horizon, future event horizon, and Granda–Oliveros cutoff.
This paper discusses the phenomenon of evolving spherically symmetric cluster of stars in the presence of an exotic matter. To discuss evolutionary mechanism, we use the Starobinsky model off(R) gravity as exotic matter and the structure scalars as evolutional parameters. We study various evolution modes such as isotropic pressure, quasi-homologous evolution, density homogeneity, and geodesic nature. The stability of  homogeneous density of baryonic and non-baryonic matter is discussed using dissipation, tidal forces, anisotropic pressures, expansion and shear-effects. It is observed that the dark matter has remarkable impact on the evolutionary changes. Also, it is shown that the dissipation factor produces density inhomogeneity in expanding clusters with shear effects. We observe that high curvature geometry enhances quasi-homologous evolution in the presence of shear. We use star Her X-1 as test star to discuss physical behavior of Starobinsky model. It is found that the density of dark matter overcomes the density of matter for large values of dark matter parametern.
The strong gravitational potential of neutron stars (NSs) makes them ideal astrophysical objects for testing extreme gravity phenomena. We explore the potential of NS X-ray pulsed light curve observations to probe deviations from general relativity (GR) within the scalar–tensor theory (STT) of gravity framework. We compute the flux from a single, circular, finite-size hot spot, accounting for light bending, Shapiro time delay, and Doppler effect. We focus on the high-compactness regime, i.e., close to the critical GR value\(GM/(c^2 R)=0.284\), over which multiple images of the spot appear and impact crucially the light curves. Our investigation is motivated by the increased sensitivity of the pulse to the scalar charge of the spacetime in such high compactness regimes, making these systems exceptionally suitable for scrutinizing deviations from GR, notably phenomena such as spontaneous scalarization, as predicted by STT. We find significant differences in NS observables, e.g., the flux of a single spot can differ up to 80% with respect to GR. Additionally, reasonable choices for the STT parameters that satisfy astrophysical constraints lead to changes in the NS radius relative to GR of up to approximately 10%. Consequently, scalar parameters might be better constrained when uncertainties in NS radii decrease, where this could occur with the advent of next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA, as well as future electromagnetic missions like eXTP and ATHENA. Thus, our findings suggest that accurate X-ray data of the NS surface emission, jointly with refined theoretical models, could constrain STTs.
Using Darmois-Israel-Sen junction conditions, and with help of Visser’s cut-and-paste method, we study the dynamics of thin-shell wormholes that are made of two conformally Killing gravity (a.k.a Harada gravity) black holes. We check the energy conditions for different values of the new parameter that Harada introduced, as alternative for dark energy. We examine the radial acceleration to reveal the attractive and repulsive characteristics of the thin-shell wormhole throat. We consider the dynamics and stability of the wormhole around the static solutions of the linearized radial perturbations at the wormhole throat. Finally, we determine the regions of stability by applying the concavity test on the “speed of sound” as a function in the throat radius and other spacetime parameters, particularly the new Harada parameter.
The discrepancy between the observed value of the cosmological constant (CC) and its expected value from quantum field theoretical considerations motivates the search for a theory in which the CC is decoupled from the vacuum energy. In this article, we consider the viability of theories in which the Einstein equations are recovered (without additional constraints) and in which the CC is regarded as an integration constant. These theories include trace-free Einstein gravity, theories constructed from the Codazzi equation (which includes Cotton gravity and a gauge-gravity inspired theory), and conformal Killing gravity. We remark on a recent debate regarding Cotton gravity and find that while the Codazzi equation of that theory is indeed underdetermined, the solutions of the Codazzi equation trivialize to\(\lambda g_{ab}\)on generic backgrounds, and that in principle, one can close the system with the divergence-free condition and an appropriate choice of initial data. We also propose a full variational principle (full in the sense that variations in all variables are considered) for each of the aforementioned theories that can incorporate the matter sector; in this manner, we can obtain the trace-free Einstein equations without a unimodular constraint. The resulting actions require additional (auxiliary) fields and are therefore only expected to be effective, but they may provide a useful starting point in bottom up approaches to constructing more fundamental theories.
The Tolman VII space-time is one of the few physically acceptable exact solutions in general relativity. In this paper, we derive a generalised Tolman VII solution which includes a charge and a cosmological constant. We analyse the spatial geometry of the solution and present conditions for zero and non-zero spatial curvature. We show that for a particular value of the boundary, the Tolman VII space-time can be matched to the charged Nariai space-time. This represents a new class of interior Nariai solutions. Matching with the Reissner–Nordström-de Sitter space-time, we derive analytic expressions for the metric functions and the pressure. Using this, we show that the solution allows for trapped null geodesics for a broad range of values for the total charge, central density, and the cosmological constant. We investigate the physical properties and derive an equation of state for the fluid. We show that the fluid can be considered a polytrope with,\(\Gamma \sim 2.5\). Finally, we analyse the sound speed and energy conditions to conclude that only a subclass of the solution follows all the basic physical acceptability criteria.
Properties of the underlying-event inppinteractions are investigated primarily via the strange hadrons\(K_{S}^{0}\),\(\Lambda \)and\(\bar{\Lambda }\), as reconstructed using the ATLAS detector at the LHC in minimum-biasppcollision data at\(\sqrt{s} = 13\)TeV. The hadrons are reconstructed via the identification of the displaced two-particle vertices corresponding to the decay modes,\(\Lambda \rightarrow \pi ^-p\)and\(\bar{\Lambda }\rightarrow \pi ^+\bar{p}\). These are used in the construction of underlying-event observables in azimuthal regions computed relative to the leading charged-particle jet in the event. None of the hadronisation and underlying-event physics models considered can describe the data over the full kinematic range considered. Events with a leading charged-particle jet in the range of\(10 < p_T \le 40\)GeV are studied using the number of prompt charged particles in the transverse region. The ratio\(N(\Lambda + \bar{\Lambda })/N(K_{S}^{0})\)as a function of the number of such charged particles varies only slightly over this range. This disagrees with the expectations of some of the considered Monte Carlo models.
We present the first calculation of photon-initiated\(\tau \)pair production in the presence of non-zero anomalous magnetic (\(a_\tau \)) and/or electric dipole (\(d_\tau \)) moments of the\(\tau \)lepton that accounts for the non-trivial interplay between these modifications with the soft survival factor and the possibility of dissociation of the hadron (proton or ion) beam. The impact of these is on general grounds not expected to have a uniform dependence on the value of\(a_\tau , d_\tau \), but in all previous analyses this assumption has been made. We have therefore investigated the importance of these effects in the context of photon-initiated\(\tau \)pair production in both pp and PbPb collisions. This is in general found to be relatively small, at the percent level in terms of any extracted limits or observations of\(a_\tau , d_\tau \), such that these effects can indeed be safely ignored in existing experimental analyses. However, as the precision of such determinations increases in the future, the relevance of these effects will likewise increase. With this in mind we have made our calculation publicly available in theSuperChicMonte Carlo generator, including the possibility to simulate this process for varying\(a_\tau , d_\tau \)without rerunning.
The azimuthal correlation angle,\(\Delta \phi \), between the scattered lepton and the leading jet in deep inelastic\(e^{\pm }p\)scattering at HERA has been studied using data collected with the ZEUS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of\(\sqrt{s} = 318 {\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-0.66666pt}\text {V}}\), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\(326 \,\text {pb}^{-1}\). A measurement of jet cross sections in the laboratory frame was made in a fiducial region corresponding to photon virtuality\(10 {\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-0.66666pt}\text {V}}^2< Q^2 < 350 {\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-0.66666pt}\text {V}}^2\), inelasticity\(0.04< y < 0.7\), outgoing lepton energy\(E_e > 10 {\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-0.66666pt}\text {V}}\), lepton polar angle\(140^\circ< \theta _e < 180^\circ \), jet transverse momentum\(2.5 {\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-0.66666pt}\text {V}}< p_\textrm{T,jet} < 30 {\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-0.66666pt}\text {V}}\), and jet pseudorapidity\(-1.5< \eta _\textrm{jet} < 1.8\). Jets were reconstructed using the\(k_\textrm{T}\)algorithm with the radius parameter\(R = 1\). The leading jet in an event is defined as the jet that carries the highest\(p_\textrm{T,jet}\). Differential cross sections,\(d\sigma /d\Delta \phi \), were measured as a function of the azimuthal correlation angle in various ranges of leading-jet transverse momentum, photon virtuality and jet multiplicity. Perturbative calculations at\(\mathcal {O}(\alpha _{s}^2)\)accuracy successfully describe the data within the fiducial region, although a lower level of agreement is observed near\(\Delta \phi \rightarrow \pi \)for events with high jet multiplicity, due to limitations of the perturbative approach in describing soft phenomena in QCD. The data are equally well described by Monte Carlo predictions that supplement leading-order matrix elements with parton showering.
We analyse neutral and charged matter distributions in second order Lovelock gravity, also known as Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity, in arbitrary dimensions for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime. We first transform the charged condition of pressure isotropy, an Abel differential equation of the second kind, into canonical form. We then determine a systematic approach to integrate the condition of pressure isotropy by showing that the canonical form is a Chini differential equation. The Chini invariant, which allows the master differential equation to be separable, is identified. This enables us to find three new general solutions, in implicit form, to the condition of pressure isotropy. We also show that previously obtained exact specific solutions arise as special cases in our general class of models. The Chini invariant does not arise in general relativity; it is a distinguishing feature of Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity.
We have studied the leptonic EDM and the LFV decays relating with the recent data of anomalous magnetic moment of muon,\((g-2)_{\mu }\)in the leptonic dipole operator. We have adopted the successful\(\Gamma _2\)modular invariant model by Meloni–Parriciatu as the flavor symmetry of leptons. Suppose the anomaly of\((g-2)_{\mu }\),\(\Delta a_{\mu }\)to be evidence of New Physics (NP), we have related it with the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron\(\Delta a_e\), the electron EDM\(d_e\)and the\(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma \)decay. We found that the NP contributions to\(\Delta a_{e(\mu )}\)are proportional to the lepton masses squared likewise the naive scaling\(\Delta a_\ell \propto m^2_\ell \). The experimental constraint of\(|d_e|\)is much tight compared with the one from the branching ratio\(\mathcal {B} (\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )\)in our framework. Supposing the phase of our model parameter\(\delta _{\alpha }\)for the electron to be of order one, we have estimated the upper-bound of\(\mathcal {B}(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )\), which is at most\(10^{-21}-10^{-20}\). If some model parameters are real, leptonic EDMs vanish since the CP phase of the modular form due to modulus\(\tau \)does not contribute to the EDM. However, we can obtain\(\mathcal {B} (\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )\simeq 10^{-13}\)with non-vanishing\(d_e\)in a specific case. The imaginary part of a parameter can lead to\(d_e\)in the next-to-leading contribution. The predicted electron EDM is below\(10^{-32}\)e cm, while\(\mathcal {B} (\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )\)is close to the experimental upper-bound. The branching ratios of\(\tau \rightarrow e\gamma \)and\(\tau \rightarrow \mu \gamma \)are also discussed.
This article analyses the stability of thin-shell wormholes constructed from non-asymptotically flat wormholes and the vacuum Schwarzschild solution. The construction of these spherically symmetric thin shells focuses on a specific class of wormholes characterized by a shape function that is linearly dependent on the radial coordinate. This introduces angular defects, which can be either deficits or excesses in the solid angle. To analyze the stability of these structures, we employ linear perturbations around a static solution, using a master equation to describe the behavior of stable equilibrium regions. The study is systematically divided to examine both positive and negative surface energy densities, and it delves into various gravitational redshift functions. Finally, it is concluded that the interaction of an external force on the thin shell significantly influences the behaviour of stable regions. It is demonstrated that, in certain cases, the matter supporting the thin shell may be non-exotic, fully satisfying all energy conditions.
We explore black hole solutions and some of its physical properties in Einstein’s theory in 4D, modified by a cubic gravity term and in the presence of non-linear electrodynamics. In the context of Effective Field Theories (EFT) and under certain assumptions, these curvature and non-linear electromagnetic terms represent the first corrections to the Einstein-Maxwell theory. We obtain static and spherically symmetric generalizations to the asymptotically flat Reissner-Nordström metric using perturbative methods, showing how an asymptotic expansion solution connects with a near horizon solution for a small coupling of the curvature correction term. We perform a thermodynamic stability analysis of the solutions. Finally, we discuss how these EFT corrections change the event horizon properties and also lead to measurable effects on black hole shadows and gravitational lensing around these solutions.
How was Lattice Gauge Theory born? What was it like in the “early days” of the 1970s and 80s before lattice field theory became a substantial subfield of high energy theory? How did high energy physics and condensed matter theory get together? What were the big physics problems and technical challenges of the day? This short talk looks at these topics from one person’s personal recollections, experiences and perspective.
Neutron stars are natural laboratories for testing gravity in the strong field regime. That is why the full spectrum of neutron star solutions in different modified theories should be thoroughly studied. Among the most natural modifications of general relativity are the theories in which additional scalar degrees of freedom are present. That is why scalar-tensor theories like Brans–Dicke and Damour–Esposito–Farese theories, as well as their extensions such as scalar-Gauss–Bonnet gravity, attracted attention throughout the years. In the present work, we combine those theory families and explore extensively the neutron star solution space in their realm. We identify qualitative new behavior of the solutions, including the existence of new types of phase transitions and new branches of solutions present only for high neutron star masses. Due to the peculiarities of the solutions, they can not be easily mimicked by a simple change of the equation of state.
The status of the equivalence principle in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity is examined. In this theory, minimum length geodesics are distinct from autoparallel geodesics, that is, the “shortest” paths are not the “straightest” paths. We show that a standard argument that singles out metric geodesics in general relativity does not apply in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity. This is because the latter theory does not obey the equivalence principle in the sense of Weinberg. We argue, however, that the structure of the theory makes it inevitable that a freely falling test particle follows a shortest path, a geodesic of the metric. The geodesic equation that governs the motion of a freely falling test particle involves the Levi-Civita connection, not some other connection obtained by solving the connection field equations of the theory. This also has bearing on whether, under appropriate conditions, modified symmetric teleparallel gravity is fully equivalent to general relativity.
Constituent quarks in a nucleon are the essential elements in the standard “quark model” associated with the electric charge, spin, mass, and baryon number of a nucleon. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes nucleon as a composite object containing current quarks (valence quarks and sea (anti-)quarks) and gluons. These subatomic elements and their interactions are known to contribute in complex ways to the overall nucleon spin and mass. In the early development of QCD theory in the 1970s, an alternative hypothesis postulated that the baryon number might manifest itself through a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields forming a Y-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. In this work, we propose to test such hypothesis by measuring (i) the Regge intercept of the net-baryon distributions fore+(p)Au collisions, (ii) baryon and charge transport in the isobaric ratio betweene+Ru ande+Zr collisions, and (iii) target flavor dependence of proton and antiproton yields at large rapidity, transported from the hydrogen and deuterium targets in\(e+p\)(d) collisions. Our study indicates that these measurements at the EIC can help determine what carries the baryon number.
Recently, the ring images or the shadow images of the centers of the galaxy M87 and the Milky way have been reported by Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. It is believed that the ring images imply that the central objects form unstable light circular orbits. Some of wormholes with\(Z_2\)symmetry against a throat are wrongly excluded from the candidates at the centers of M87 and the Milky way due to the overlooking the unstable light circular orbits on the throat. A general asymptotically-flat, static, and spherical symmetrical wormhole without a thin shell has at least one unstable circular light orbit at the throat or elsewhere. If the wormhole has\(Z_2\)symmetry against the throat, it has the unstable circular light orbits on the throat or it has stable circular light orbits on the throat and unstable ones near the throat. We need to analyze the throat carefully to make sure we do not unfairly rule out the\(Z_2\)-symmetrical wormholes. In this study, we categorize the numbers of the circular light orbits of the\(Z_2\)-symmetrical wormhole and their stability from the derivatives of an effective potential at the throat and we investigate the circular light orbits around a Simpson–Visser black-bounce spacetime, a Damour–Solodukhin wormhole spacetime, a Reissner–Nordström black-hole-like wormhole spacetime or a charged Damour–Solodukhin wormhole spacetime as examples. We give complete treatments including degenerated circular light orbits made from more than one stable and unstable circular light orbits on and off the throat.
The electrical conductivity of hot and dense quark matter is calculated using the 2-flavour gauged Nambu–Jona–Lasinio (NJL) model in the presence of a chiral imbalance quantified in terms of a chiral chemical potential (CCP). To this end, the in-medium spectral function corresponding to the vector current correlator is evaluated employing the real time formulation of finite temperature field theory. Taking the long wavelength limit of the spectral function we extract the electrical conductivity using the Green–Kubo relation. The thermal widths of the quarks/antiquarks that appear in the expression of electrical conductivity are calculated by considering the\(2\rightarrow 2\)scattering in the NJL model. The scattering amplitudes containing the polarization functions of the mesonic modes in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels are also evaluated by considering finite value of CCP. We find that the ratio of electrical conductivity to temperature has significant dependence on CCP especially in the low temperature region.
In this paper, we investigate a generalization of Kiselev black holes by introducing a varying equation-of-state parameter for the anisotropic fluid surrounding the black hole. We extend this model by allowingwin the expression\(p_t(r)/\rho (r) = (3w + 1)/2\)to vary as a function of the radial coordinate, and derive new solutions to the Einstein field equations for this configuration. In particular, we study solutions that describe regular black holes. By choosing specific forms ofw(r), we obtain regular black hole solutions, and show that the matter surrounding the black hole can satisfy the weak and strong energy conditions under certain values of parameters analyzed. Due to the generality of this treatment, other categories of black holes can be obtained with particular choices of the equation-of-state parameter. Our analysis confirms that the curvature invariants associated with the regular black holes remain finite at the origin, indicating the absence of singularities. We also explore the physical properties of the matter associated with these solutions. Due to its versatility, we suggest the possibility of using this approach as a tool to construct new physical solutions associated with regular black holes or other geometries of interest.
Using the dynamical systems approach together with the cosmographic parameters, we present amodel-independentdynamical system formulation for cosmology inf(R) gravity. The formulation is model-independent in the sense that one needs to specify not a particular functional form off(R) a-priori, but rather a particular cosmological evolution, which fixes the cosmography. In a sense, our approach is the way around the reconstruction method. This is shown using both non-compact and compact dynamical variables. The focus in this paper is on the compact analysis since we demonstrate the applicability of this formulation using examples of bouncing and cyclic cosmology. In particular, our analysis reveals, in a model-independent manner, the problem of achieving such cosmologies when the universe is globally spatially flat and devoid of matter.
Highly magnetized neutron stars have quantum refraction effects on pulsar emission due to the non-linearity of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) action. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the polarization states of pulsar emission under the quantum refraction effects, combined with the dependence on the emission frequency, for dipole and quadrudipole pulsar models; we solve a system of evolution equations of the Stokes vector, where the birefringent vector, in which such effects are encoded, acts on the Stokes vector. At a fixed emission frequency, depending on the magnitude of the birefringent vector, dominated mostly by the magnetic field strength, the evolution of the Stokes vector largely exhibits three different patterns: (i) monotonic, or (ii) half-oscillatory, or (iii) highly oscillatory behaviors. These features are understood and confirmed by means of approximate analytical solutions to the evolution equations. Also, the evolution patterns are shown to differ between dipole and quadrudipole pulsar models, depending on the magnetic field strength.
A phenomenological analysis based on the published branching fractions andCPasymmetry observables of the\(B\rightarrow K\pi \),\(B\rightarrow \pi \pi \)and\(B\rightarrow KK\)dataset is performed. The amplitude decomposition by the topological diagrams and theSU(3) irreducible representation is used. The result of the global fit can be interpreted as a solution to the “\(B\rightarrow K\pi \)puzzle”. The obtained precision enables to test aSU(3)-based sum rule showing\(6\sigma \)discrepancy with the expectation value in the Standard Model scenario. To improve the obtained results the main effort should concentrate on the\(B^0\rightarrow K^0\pi ^0\)measurements.
Due to the spin-orbit coupling, Dirac fermions, submerged in a thermal bath with finite macroscopic vorticity, exhibit a spin polarisation along the direction parallel to the vorticity vector\(\varvec{\Omega }\). Due to the symmetries of the Lagrangian for free massless Dirac particles, there are three independent and classically conserved currents corresponding to the vector, axial, and helical charges. The constitutive relations for the charge currents and the stress-energy tensor at thermal equilibrium, derived in the framework of quantum field theory at finite temperature, reveal vorticity-induced contributions that deviate from the perfect fluid form. In this paper, we consider the mode structure of the corresponding hydrodynamical theory and derive collective excitations associated with coherent fluctuations of all three charges. We show that the chirally imbalanced rotating fluid should possess non-reciprocal gapless waves that propagate with different velocities along and opposite to the vorticity vector. We also uncover a strictly unidirectional mode, which we call the axial vortical wave, propagating in the background of the axial charge density. The emergence of this wave can be traced back to earlier studies of vortical chiral fluids in a hydrodynamic approach. We also point out an unexpected instability in the limit of degenerate matter and discuss possible solutions when helicity and axial charge non-conservation are taken into account.
This study examines the compatibility of the generalized holographic equipartition proposed in Sheykhi (Phys Rev D 87(6):061501, 2013) with the maximization of horizon entropy in an (n + 1)-dimensional non-flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) universe. Here, the entropy associated with the apparent horizon is described by Kaniadakis entropy, as well as truncated Kaniadakis entropy, which is expanded and truncated to third order when the Kaniadakis parameter\((K)\)is small, indicating minor deviations from the standard Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. Initially, we derive the conditions required for maximizing both Kaniadakis horizon entropy and truncated Kaniadakis horizon entropy. We then examine whether the generalized holographic equipartition aligns with the constraints of horizon entropy maximization. Our findings reveal that the generalized holographic equipartition is consistent with the maximization of Kaniadakis horizon entropy and truncated Kaniadakis horizon entropy in a universe with non-zero spatial curvature.
We investigate thermodynamics of apparent horizon in thef(Q) universe with trivial and nontrivial connections. We first explore the perspectives of  the first law, generalized second law andP–Vphase transition with trivial connection. We show that the lowest-order correction of entropy has the same form as that in loop quantum gravity, and the critical exponents of the phase transition caused by the lowest-order correction are consistent with those in mean field theory. We then examine the thermodynamic implication of nontrivial connections. We find that nontrivial connections in thef(Q) universe imply non-equilibrium states from the perspective of thermodynamics.
We construct exact analytical Taub-NUT solutions in the context off(T) gravity. We study the physical properties of the solutions, and compare them with those of the Taub-NUT solution in Einstein gravity.
We examine the stability of a spherically symmetric regular black hole when subjected to perturbations from a charged scalar field. This particular black hole is constructed by deforming the Minkowski spacetime. It has been  observed that the charged superradiant instability arises only within a specific range of the deformation parameter, potentially resulting in an instability growth rate with a maximum magnitude of approximately\(\text {Im} (M \omega ) \sim 10^{-3}\). This growth rate significantly exceeds the instability identified in ABG black holes discussed in prior research, suggesting a notable timescale for detecting this phenomenon in astrophysical scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a thorough investigation into how the three parameters of the model influence the onset and intensity of the instability. Our analysis offers further insights into the possible emergence of this instability in spherical regular black holes and its association with the nonlinear effects of the electromagnetic field.
The ATLAS tile calorimeter (TileCal) is the hadronic sampling calorimeter covering the central region of the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This paper gives an overview of the calorimeter’s operation and performance during the years 2015–2018 (Run 2). In this period, ATLAS collected proton–proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and the TileCal was 99.65% efficient for data-taking. The signal reconstruction, the calibration procedures, and the detector operational status are presented. The performance of two ATLAS trigger systems making use of TileCal information, the minimum-bias trigger scintillators and the tile muon trigger, is discussed. Studies of radiation effects allow the degradation of the output signals at the end of the LHC and HL-LHC operations to be estimated. Finally, the TileCal response to isolated muons, hadrons and jets from proton–proton collisions is presented. The energy and time calibration methods performed excellently, resulting in good stability and uniformity of the calorimeter response during Run 2. The setting of the energy scale was performed with an uncertainty of 2%. The results demonstrate that the performance is in accordance with specifications defined in the Technical Design Report.
We explore wormhole solutions sourced by Casimir energy density involving generalized uncertainty principle corrections within the framework of Rastall–Rainbow gravity. The questions of traversability and stability, as well as the presence of exotic matter, are carefully investigated. In particular, the stability issue is addressed via an approach that has not been previously employed in the context of wormholes. This method, which represents an improved version of the so-called Herrera cracking technique, has the potential to yield novel insights in the field of wormhole geometries.
Compact stars have long served as a test bed of gravitational models and their coupling with stellar matter. In this work, we explore the behavior of an exponential model inf(T) gravity through the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. This is performed for different envelope thicknesses. Finally, constraints on the models parameters are obtained, which are comparable to the results obtained using cosmological survey data. This consistency across the strong astrophysical and weak cosmological scales shows reasonable viability of the underlying model.
We extend the formalism of tri-vector deformations to the full SL(5) exceptional field theory with no truncation assumed thus covering 11D backgrounds of any form. We derive explicit transformation rules for 11D supergravity component fields and prove that these generate solutions given the same algebraic conditions hold: generalized Yang–Baxter equation and the unimodularity condition.
We report on the reactions\(\psi (3770)\rightarrow \bar{\Omega }^+ \bar{K} \Xi \)and\(\psi (3770)\rightarrow \bar{\Omega }^+ \bar{K}\Xi ^*(1530) \;(\Xi ^*(1530)\rightarrow \pi \Xi \)), and calculate the mass distributions\(\frac{\textrm{d}\Gamma }{\textrm{d}M_\text {inv}(\bar{K}\Xi )}\)and\(\frac{\textrm{d}\Gamma }{\textrm{d}M_\text {inv}(\bar{K}\Xi ^*)}\), respectively. We obtain clear peaks corresponding to the\(\Omega (2012)\). From the decay of\(\psi (3770)\rightarrow \bar{\Omega }^+ \bar{K}\Xi ^*\), we also get a second, broader, peak around\(2035\,\mathrm MeV\), which comes from the\(\Omega (2012)\)decay to\(\bar{K}\Xi ^*\). This second peak is closely tied to the molecular picture of the\(\Omega (2012)\)with the\(\bar{K}\Xi ^*(1530)\)and\(\eta \Omega \)components. Its observation would provide a boost to the molecular picture of the\(\Omega (2012)\).
Starting from a Wheeler–DeWitt type equation for an uncharged black hole\(Q=0\), and by choosing the order parameter\((s=2)\)and running the gravitational degrees of freedom it is possible to reduce the Wheeler–DeWitt equation to the canonical form of a quantum harmonic oscillator. In this direction, a natural frequency of oscillation is identified for the black hole. The entanglement entropy of a pair of interacting quantum black holes of massMis obtained and analyzed. Here we consider as a starting model a pair of identical oscillators of frequency\(\omega \)coupled by a quadratic potential and with interaction constant given by\(\omega _{c}\). Given the relation between the oscillation frequency\(\omega \)of an isolated quantum black hole and its mass, the entanglement entropy of this system is obtained by analogy with a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by a quadratic interaction potential of frequency\(\omega _{c}\). The analysis of the entanglement entropy is performed by introducing the reduced variables\({\widetilde{\omega }}\)and\({\widetilde{A}}\). An interesting result arises when we consider\({\widetilde{A}}\gg 1\)and the interaction parameter is set\({\widetilde{\omega }}=1\). In this case, the entanglement entropy can be replaced by its asymptotic expansion, where the dominant term is of logarithmic character in the reduced area. Another case of analysis emerges when the reduced area\({\widetilde{A}}=1\)and\({\widetilde{\omega }}\)varies. In this case, the entanglement entropy depends uniquely on the interaction parameter between the two black holes.
In the framework of the relativized  quark model, the calculation of spin-orbit interactions is improved by considering the contribution from the light-quark cluster in a singly heavy baryon. It modifies the energy level splitting of the orbital excitation significantly and causes the emergence of fine structures for\(\Sigma _{Q}\),\(\Xi '_{Q}\)and\(\Omega _{Q}\)baryons. Based on this improvement, we systematically analyze the  fine structures and retest the heavy quark dominance mechanism. This mechanism is found to be violated in the 1P-wave states of the\(\Sigma _{c}\),\(\Xi '_{c}\)and\(\Omega _{c}\)baryons although it remains effective overall, which may help to understand the nature of the heavy quarks and strong interactions. With the predicted fine structures, we make the precise assignments of those observed heavy baryons which once could not be accurately explained due to their close mass values. The method used in this work is instructive and applicable for the study of more complex exotic hadrons, such as the heavy tetraquarks and pentaquarks.
In the context of braneworld scenarios, the real scalar field plays a crucial role by providing thickness for brane. In this work, we investigate a codimension-one thick brane within the framework off(R,Q,P) gravity, whereRrepresents the curvature scalar, while\(Q=R_{\mu \nu }R^{\mu \nu }\)and\(P=R_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta }R^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta }\)are quadratic geometric invariants. Our interest  is to investigate the influence of these invariants on the scalar field solution and the energy density of the brane. Furthermore, we analyze the localization of spin 1/2 fermions and the gravitino by employing a Yukawa-like coupling with the scalar field background. Such a coupling is able to produce a normalizable zero-mode for both fields.
Proton–proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011, at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, have been used for an improved determination of theW-boson mass and a first measurement of theW-boson width at the LHC. Recent fits to the proton parton distribution functions are incorporated in the measurement procedure and an improved statistical method is used to increase the measurement precision. The measurement of theW-boson mass yields a value of\(m_W = 80{,}366.5 \pm 9.8~(\text {stat.}) \pm 12.5~(\text {syst.})\)MeV\(= 80{,}366.5 \pm 15.9\)MeV, and the width is measured as\(\Gamma _W = 2202 \pm 32~(\text {stat.}) \pm 34~(\text {syst.})\)MeV\(= 2202 \pm 47\)MeV. The first uncertainty components are statistical and the second correspond to the experimental and physics-modelling systematic uncertainties. Both results are consistent with the expectation from fits to electroweak precision data. The present measurement of\(m_W\)is compatible with and supersedes the previous measurement performed using the same data.
In this work, we calculated the form factors of the weak decay process\(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+\), where the final charm baryon represents an excited state with spin-parity\(\frac{1}{2}^-\). Utilizing the light-cone QCD sum rules approach, we incorporated the contributions of the lowest two charm baryon states: the ground state\(\varLambda _c\)with\(J^P=\frac{1}{2}^+\)and the excited state\(\varLambda _c(2595)^+\)with\(J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-\)in the hadronic representation of the\(\varLambda _b \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+\)transition correlation function. This approach allows us to extract the form factors of the\(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+\)from\(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c^+\)transition. During the light-cone QCD sum rules procedure, we employed the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the\(\varLambda _b\)baryon. Furthermore, by combining these form factors with the helicity amplitudes of the bottom baryon transition matrix elements, we calculated the differential decay widths for the processes\(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+\ell ^-\bar{\nu }_\ell \)and provided the optimal choice of the interpolating current for\(\varLambda _c\)in this process. Additionally, within the lifetime of\(\varLambda _b^0\), we obtained the absolute branching fractions for the semileptonic decays\(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+ \ell ^- \bar{\nu }_\ell \). With the branching fractions of\(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+ \ell ^- \bar{\nu }_\ell \)calculated in this work, we also determined the parameter\(\mathcal {R}(\varLambda _c(2595)^+)\)which tests the lepton flavor universality. This parameter is defined as the ratio of branching fractions\(\mathcal {B}r(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+\tau ^-\bar{\nu }_\tau )\)and\(\mathcal {B}r(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+\mu ^-\bar{\nu }_\mu )\). Our results provide a valuable theoretical test for these decay channels and offer insights into the LCDAs of bottom baryons, paving the way for further in-depth investigations.
We study the\(B^+ \rightarrow D^{*-}D^+K^+\)reaction, showing that a peak in the\(D^+K^+\)mass distribution around\(2834 \text { MeV}\)reported by LHCb could be associated with a theoretical exotic state with that mass, a width of\(19 \text { MeV}\)and\(J^P=2^+\), stemming from the interaction of the\(D^{*+}K^{*+}\)and\(D^{*+}_s \rho ^+\)channels, which is a partner of the\(0^+\)\(T_{c{\bar{s}}}(2900)\). We show that the data is compatible with this assumption, but also see that the mass distribution itself cannot discriminate between the spins\(J=0\), 1, 2 of the state. Then we evaluate the momenta of the angular mass distribution and show that they are very different for each of the spin assumptions, and that the momenta coming from interference terms have larger strength at the resonant energy than the peaks seen in the angular integrated mass distribution. We make a call for the experimental determination of these magnitudes, which has already been used by the LHCb in related decay reactions.
Romano has recently found that frequency modulation of gravitational waves (GWs) could be used as a dark matter probe. Many candidates for dark matter (DM) of various sources have been proposed in the literature.  In this work, we use a teleparallel modified GW model to obtain DM dark torsion from LIGO data, where frequency modulation and frequency bands from various sources of GWs are investigated with regard to their suitability for DM dark torsion detection. In particular, nonhomogeneous and nonuniform chiral chemical potential generates GWs and dark torsion from primordial magnetic fields. It is shown that pulsar sources for GWs bathing the surface of the Earth on a contortion background of\(10^{-15}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}\)possess amplitudes well within the parameters of LIGO capabilities of amplitudes on the order of\(10^{-22}\). GWs are also investigated in the context of having been produced by a primordial magnetic field and inhomogeneity on the chiral chemical potential. The torsion signatures at LIGO correspond to the amplitude dependence of massive torsion by GWs.
We present an analysis of the lepton-flavor violating decay of the Higgs boson mediated by an ultralight gauge boson,\(\chi \). Our analysis matches a model generating the lepton flavor-violating interaction\(\bar{\ell }_i\ell _j\chi \)at tree level with an effective field theory, safeguarding a physical massless\(\chi \)-boson limit of the observables. By utilizing the upper bounds on\(H\rightarrow \ell _i {\bar{\ell }}_j\)decays from CMS and ATLAS Collaborations, we establish an indirect upper limit on the nonstandard decay\(H\rightarrow \ell _i {\bar{\ell }}_j\chi \). The analysis encompasses various observables such as the lepton energy spectrum, Dalitz plot distribution, and Lepton Charge and Forward-Backward Asymmetries.
Matter properties at the intermediate densities are still unknown to us. In this work, we use a neural network approach to study matter at intermediate densities to analyze the variation of the speed of sound and the measure of trace anomaly considering astrophysical constraints of mass–radius measurement of 18 neutron stars. Our numerical results show that there is a sharp rise in the speed of sound just beyond the saturation energy density. It attains a peak around 3–4 times the saturation energy density and, after that, decreases. This hints towards the appearance of new degrees of freedom and smooth transition from hadronic matter in massive stars. The trace anomaly is maximum at low density (surface of the stars) and decreases as we reach high density. It approaches zero and can even be slightly negative at the centre of massive stars. It has a negative trough beyond the maximal central densities of neutron stars. The change in sign of the trace anomaly hints towards a near-conformal matter at the centre of neutron stars, which may not necessarily be conformal quark matter.
We study the Energy Conditions in modified\(f(\mathcal {G})\)gravity, with\(\mathcal {G}\)being the topological Gauss–Bonnet term. Then we use the cosmographic parameters to constrain the functional form of the gravitational action and investigate the possibility to have standard inflation in the early time. Specifically, we select models containing symmetries within the modified\(f(\mathcal {G})\)theory and obtain conditions for which (i) the energy conditions can be violated and (ii) the magnitude of the slow-roll parameters is small, thus suggesting that under given limits the analyzed theory can potentially trace the cosmic history both at early and at the late times.
Raoul Gatto and Bruno Touschek’s collaboration in the establishment of electron–positron colliders as a fundamental discovery tool in particle physics will be illustrated. In particular, we will tell the little-known story of how Gatto and Touschek’s pioneering visions combined to provide the theoretical foundation for AdA, the first matter–antimatter collider, and how their friendship with Wolfgang Pauli and Gerhard Lüders was crucial to their understanding of the CPT theorem, the basis for AdA’s success. We will see how these two exceptional scientists shaped physics between Rome and Frascati, from the proposal to build AdA and soon after the larger machine ADONE in 1961, to the discovery of the\(J/\Psi \)particle in 1974. We will also highlight Gatto and Touschek’s contribution in mentoring an extraordinary cohort of students and collaborators whose work contributed to the renaissance of Italian theoretical physics after the Second World War and to the establishment of the Standard Model of particle physics.
Intrinsic spin of fermions can generate torsion in spacetime. This torsion is a non-propagating field that can be integrated out, leaving an effective non-universal four-fermion interaction. This geometrical interaction affects fermions inside a matter distribution and can be expected to become stronger as the density grows. We investigate the role of this interaction in a gravitationally collapsing fermionic distribution, by considering a statistical average of the interaction term which incorporates the effect of mixed vector and axial currents. We consider a gravitationally collapsing distribution of massive fermions, ignoring other interactions. Using simplified yet reasonable assumptions, we establish that the contribution can be attractive or repulsive depending on how torsion couples with different chiralities. Also, the interaction starts to dominate as the collapse proceeds, accelerating or decelerating the collapse depending on the relative signs of the geometrical interaction between different species of fermions.
We investigate the structure of the minimal left-right symmetric model that enables precise predictions in the gauge, scalar and neutrino sector. We revisit the complete set of mass spectra and mixings for the charged and neutral gauge bosons, would-be-Goldstones and gauge fixing, together with the ghost Lagrangian. In the scalar sector, we analytically re-derive all the massive states with mixings and devise a non-trivial physical input scheme, expressing the model couplings in terms of masses and mixing angles. Fermion couplings are also determined in closed form, including the Dirac mixing in the neutrino sector, evaluated explicitly using the Cayley–Hamilton theorem. These analytic developments are implemented in a comprehensive FeynRules model file. We calculate the one loop QCD corrections and provide a complete UFO file for NLO studies, demonstrated on relevant hadron-collider benchmarks. We provide various restricted variants of the model file with different gauges, massless states, neutrino hierarchies and parity violating\(g_L \ne g_R\)gauge couplings.
We investigate the perturbation of the scalar field as well as the electromagnetic field over a sort of regular black holes which are characterized by the sub-Planckian curvature and the Minkowskian core. Specifically, we compute the quasinormal modes (QNMs) by employing the pseudo-spectral method. The outburst of overtones is manifestly observed in the QNMs of these regular black holes, which can be attributed to the deviation of the Schwarzschild black hole by quantum effects of gravity. Furthermore, the QNMs under the perturbation of electromagnetic field exhibit smaller real and imaginary parts than those under scalar field perturbation. By comparing the QNMs of the regular black hole featured by Minkowskian core with those of Bardeen black hole featured by de Sitter core, we find they may be an effective tool to distinguish these BHs.
We are discussing a scenario where a compact star (neutron star, NS) is embedded in a thin, uniform density background cloud (a remnant cloud after a supernova or a cloud generated from the late stages of a star e.g., a planetary nebula or asymptotic red giant phases) and its effect on the stability of the compact star. Due to the thin background cloud, the spacetime geometry is minimally deformed allowing us to employ the technique of minimal geometric decoupling (MGD). Assuming a uniform background cloud density simplifies the problem, and through the MGD method, one can take\(\Theta ^t_t = \Theta > 0\), where\(\Theta \)is the density of the cloud. The background cloud interacts with the compact star through a coupling strength\(\alpha \). By varying\(\alpha \), one can tune the cloud density to analyze the stability of the embedded compact star. We found that for\(\alpha < 3 \times 10^{-5}\), all the thermodynamic quantities are well-behaved, indicating a stable configuration. Once the coupling parameter exceeds\(3 \times 10^{-5}\), the adiabatic index drops below\(\Gamma _{\text {max}}'\), triggering a gravitational collapse. Beyond this limit of\(\alpha \), the pressure and speed of sound also become non-physical. At the end, we have used the\(M-R\)curve generated from the solution to determine the radii of a few compact stars, namely PSR J1614-2230, PSR J0952-0607, GW190814, and GW200210. Furthermore, we have discussed the possibility of the secondary component of GW200210 i.e. the less massive compact object with an upper mass of\(3.3M_\odot \), which may be a stellar black hole with a Schwarzschild radius\(R_{\text {BH}} = 9.746\)km. However, if the mass is\(2.83M_\odot \)as observed, then its predicted minimum radius is 10.74 km, corresponding to\(\alpha = 0\). This radius is far beyond\(R_{\text {BH}} = 8.357\)km and therefore is most probably a massive NS in the mass gap.
Dyonic black holes with quasitopological electromagnetism exhibit an intriguing phase diagram with two separated first-order coexistence curves. In this paper, we aim to uncover its influence on the black hole thermodynamical topology. At first, we investigate the phase transition and phase diagram of the dyonic black holes. Comparing with previous study that there is no  black hole phase transition region for a middle pressure, we find this region can narrow or disappear by fine tuning the coupling parameter. Instead, two first-order phase transitions can be observed. Importantly, we uncover that such novel phase diagram shall lead to a multiple defect curve phenomenon in black hole topology where each dyonic black hole is treated as one defect in the thermodynamical parameter space. By examining the topology, it is shown that there could be one, three, or five black hole states for given pressure and temperature. For each case, the topological number is calculated. Our results show that the topological number always takes value of\(+1\), keeping unchanged even when the multiple defect curves appear. Therefore, our study provides an important ingredient on understanding the black hole thermodynamical topology.
The Parton Branching method offers a Monte Carlo solution to the DGLAP evolution equations by incorporating Sudakov form factors. In this approach, the Sudakov form factor can be divided into perturbative and non-perturbative components, with the non-perturbative part being analytically calculable under specific conditions. We first examine forward evolution and demonstrate that including soft and non-perturbative gluons (through the non-perturbative Sudakov form factor) is essential for the proper cancellation of divergent terms in parton density evolution. This non-perturbative component is also important for Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) parton distributions, and within the Parton Branching framework, it is constrained by fits to inclusive collinear parton densities. Additionally, we explore the impact of this non-perturbative Sudakov form factor on backward parton evolution and its effects on parton and hadron spectra originating from initial state showers. Our results show that soft and non-perturbative gluons significantly influence inclusive distributions, such as Drell–Yan transverse momentum spectra. However, we found that soft and non-perturbative gluons have a minimal impact on final state hadron spectra and jets.
In view of the recent discovery of\(T_{cc}\), which can be described as a\(DD^*\)molecular state, we perform a study of the\(KDD^*\)system, and its extension to studying\(KD^*D^*\), where\(D^*D^*\)is bound as a spin 1\(T_{cc}\)-like state, to search for the possible existence of exotic mesons with the open flavorsccsbeing part of their quark configuration. Considering the additional attractive interactions present in theKDand\(KD^*\)subsystems, where the states\(D^*_{s0}(2317)\)and\(D_{s1}(2460)\)are generated, we solve the Faddeev equations considering the fixed-center approximation for the mentioned three-body systems and find the existence of two doubly charmed\(K^*\)-like mesons,\(K_{cc}^*(4309)\)and\(K_{cc}^*(4449)\), with quantum numbers\(I(J^P)=1/2\,(1^-)\). Considering the respective three-body thresholds of the two systems, both\(K_{cc}\)-states are bound by around 60 MeV. An experimental confirmation will bring evidence for the existence of a degree of exoticity beyond charm +2.
It is shown that the hadronic phase in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions can be used to understand the properties of the\(f_0(980)\)resonance. In particular it is shown that the centrality dependence of the\(f_0(980)/\pi \)and\(f_0(980)/\phi \)ratios depends strongly on the\(f_0(980)\rightarrow {\overline{K}}+K\)branching ratio and whether the\(f_0(980)\)is produced as a\(\left| {\overline{q}}q \right\rangle \)or\(\left| {\overline{s}}s \right\rangle \)state. These conclusions are drawn from calculations within the partial chemical equilibrium of the HRG model within Thermal-FIST as well as with the fully non-equilibrium hybrid-transport approach UrQMD. Our findings show how the hadronic phase in heavy ion collisions can be used for studies of exotic hadron properties otherwise possible only in dedicated experiments such as PANDA.
We investigate a compelling model of a rotating black hole that is deformed by the effects of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We present a simplified metric and explore two distinct geometries: one in which the masses of the black hole and white hole are equal, and another in which they differ. Our analysis yields the radius of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), as well as the energy and angular momentum of a particle within this framework. Additionally, we find the frequency of the first-order resonance separately. We constrain the model by the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) of the X-ray binary GRO J1655-40. We show that\(\lambda =0.15^{+0.23}_{-0.14}\)at\(1\sigma \)confidence level for equal mass black hole and white hole geometry. For the other geometry we get\(\lambda =0.11^{+0.07}_{-0.07}\)at\(1\sigma \)confidence level. We encounter a degeneracy in the parameter space that hinders our ability to constrain\(\lambda \)with greater precision.
This work studies the periapsis shift in the equatorial plane of arbitrary stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes. Two perturbative methods are systematically developed. The first works for small eccentricity but very general orbit size and the second, which is post-Newtonian and includes two variants, is more accurate for orbits of large size but allows general eccentricity. Results from these methods are shown to be equivalent under small eccentricity and large size limits. The periapsis shift of Kerr–Newman, Kerr–Sen and Kerr–Taub-NUT spacetimes is computed to high orders. The electric charge and NUT charge are shown to contribute to the leading order but with opposite signs. The frame-dragging term and high-order effect of spacetime spin are given. The electric and NUT charges of the Earth, Sun and Sgr A* are constrained using the Mercury, satellite and S2 precession data. Periapsis shifts of other spacetimes are obtained too.

In this study, we investigate the parameterized Konoplya–Rezzolla–Zhidenko (KRZ) black hole (BH) spacetime in the presence of an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field. We first examine the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radii for both neutral and charged test particles, demonstrating that the deformation parameters,\(\delta _1\)and\(\delta _2\), reduce the ISCO values. Subsequently, we assess the energy efficiency of the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) for an axially symmetric parameterized BH, analyzing the effects of the deformation parameters and the magnetic field on the energy extraction process. Our findings indicate that the rotational deformation parameter\(\delta _2\)is crucial for the efficiency of energy extraction from the BH. The synergy between the rotational deformation parameter and the magnetic field significantly boosts the energy extraction efficiency, with values exceeding\(100\%\). Interestingly, for extremal BHs with negative\(\delta _2\)values, the energy efficiency increases, in contrast to Kerr BHs where the MPP effect diminishes. Additionally, we explore the astrophysical implications of the MPP by deriving the maximum energy of a proton escaping from the KRZ parameterized BH due to the beta decay of a free neutron near the horizon. Our results show that negative\(\delta _2\)values require stronger magnetic fields to achieve equivalent energy levels for high-energy protons, providing deeper insights into high-energy astrophysical phenomena around the parameterized BH.
We investigate the screening length of a heavy quark–antiquark (\(Q{\bar{Q}}\)) pair in non-commutative\({\mathcal {N}}=4\)super Yang–Mills plasma at strong coupling. We perform the analysis by computing the Wilson loop in a boosted background and consider the axis of the\(Q{\bar{Q}}\)pair along different directions. It turns out that the inclusion of non-commutativity increases the screening length, thus enhancing the binding energy of the\(Q{\bar{Q}}\)pair. Furthermore, the presence of non-commutativity reduces quarkonium dissociation, in agreement with previous findings of the imaginary potential and entropic force.
We study quantum quenches and subsequent non-equilibrium dynamics of free Dirac fermions in 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions using time dependent mass. The final state is a normalized boundary state which is called generalized Calabrese-Cardy (gCC) state and the system thermalizes to a generalized Gibb’s Ensemble(GGE). We can also tune the initial states so that the final states are exact Calabrese-Cardy (CC) state and special gCC states. The system in the CC state thermalizes to a Gibb’s ensemble. We derive closed-form analytic expressions for the growth of entanglement entropy of subsystems consisting of arbitrary number of disjoint intervals in CC state. We show that the entanglement entropy of a single interval grows monotonically before saturation. In case of certain gCC states, for particular charges, the entanglement entropy of a single interval grows non-monotonically when the effective chemical potential is increased beyond a critical value. We argue that the non-monotonic growth of entanglement entropy is a boundary effect which arises due to increase in long range correlation and decrease in short range correlation at early times.
The detection of molecules on the coldest and outermost objects in our Solar System has long been limited by the terrestrial atmosphere and sensitivity of the available instrumentation. However, near-infrared observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have provided an unprecedented view of the molecular diversity on the surfaces of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Using the low spectral resolution PRISM mode on the near-infrared spectrograph as part of the Cycle 1 large programme, ‘Discovering the Surface Composition of trans-Neptunian objects’, we report the detection of several molecular ices throughout the TNO population, including H2O, CO2,13CO2, CO, CH3OH and complex molecules and refractory materials containing aliphatic C–H, C≡N, O–H and N–H bonds. As a result of the imprint that these molecules leave on the spectra, three main compositional groups consistently emerge from multiple independent cluster analyses. Our results unlock the long-standing question of the interpretation of colour diversity, providing the much-needed compositional information. The marked separation of the three spectral clusters reveals sharp variations in the surface molecular constituents. The C/O and (CH + NH)/(C + O) ratios on the surface of TNOs are the primary indicators of the spectral differences among the three TNO compositional groups observed. We propose that these objects are fossil remnants of icy planetesimals, and that the three compositional groups provide a picture of the ice retention lines in the Solar System that likely occurred in the outer protoplanetary disk, possibly just before a major planetary migration.
Measurements of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) suggest a complex composition with significant  contributions from heavy nuclei at the highest energies. We systematically explore how the selection and number of primary nuclei included in the analysis impact the inferred UHECR mass composition. Introducing a distance measure in the space of\(X_\textrm{max}\)distribution moments, we demonstrate that limiting the analysis to a few primaries can introduce significant biases, particularly as observational data improves. We provide lists of primaries approximately equidistant in the new measure, which guaranty unbiased results at given statistical confidence. Additionally, we explore consistent inclusion of nuclei heavier than iron and up to plutonium, deriving first observational upper bounds on their contributions to UHECR with the Pierre Auger Open Data.
Centaurs are small bodies orbiting between Jupiter and Neptune and behave as an intermediate population between trans-Neptunian-belt objects and Jupiter-family comets. As such, their surface composition and evolutionary processes are key to understanding the Solar System’s history. However, the mechanisms driving their transformation and the impact of thermal processing on their surfaces remain open questions. Here we examined the surface properties of five Centaurs using the James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared spectrograph reflectance spectra (0.6–5.3 μm). They exhibit considerable diversity in surface composition. Our analysis indicates that Centaurs can be split into two main categories, which is also observed for trans-Neptunian objects: one group has surfaces composed of refractory materials with some water ice, whereas the other is dominated by carbon-based materials. Additionally, two of the five objects have primarily refractory surfaces with minimal volatiles, suggesting a high concentration of primitive, comet-like dust. We suggest that the observed Centaur surfaces reflect their transitional states, as they are shifting from being ice-rich bodies to progressively becoming more dominated by non-volatile materials as they approach the Sun. Such thermal processing may have changed the surface properties of other similar Solar System bodies, like comets, Jupiter trojans and D-type asteroids.
The existence of a set of 10 Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries, which acts on three-dimensional hypersurfaces (spacelike or timelike), leads to the existence of two distinct families of 5D geometries. These models represent the general solutions of the bulk field equations where their energy-momentum tensor, includes only two components: a negative cosmological constant and a parallel pressure\(p_{\parallel }\)aligned with the extra spatial dimension. Significantly, these models offer a novel perspective for investigating the impacts of spatial inhomogeneity and anisotropy on the cosmological evolution of the Universe, particularly within the context of the braneworld scenarios. It is shown that one of these families reduces to afully inhomogeneous, anisotropic and conformally flat brane modelwith aperfect fluid equation of stateand corresponds to the Stephani Universe (i.e. a Stephani brane) which implies that our model can be matched smoothly with the standard FRW model. We provide the generalized Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations and we present how the additional quantities could affect the cosmological evolution. In particular we show that the new constituents are the terms\(p_{\parallel }\),\(\sigma ^{2}\)and the four acceleration of the brane observers that could affect the observational measurement of the Hubble parameter depending on which term dominates therefore provide us a potential answer to the Hubble tension and cosmic acceleration problems due to local inhomogeneities and anisotropies.
Relativistic jets are thought to play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of massive galaxies and supermassive black holes. Blazars, which are quasars with jets aligned along our line of sight, provide insights into the jetted population and have been observed up to redshifts ofz= 6.1. Here, we report the discovery and multi-wavelength characterization of the blazar VLASS J041009.05−013919.88 atz= 7 (age of the Universe ~750 Myr), which is powered by a ~7 × 108M⊙black hole. The presence of this high-redshift blazar implies a large population of similar but unaligned jetted sources in the early Universe. Our findings suggest two possible scenarios. In one, the jet in J0410−0139 is intrinsically low power but appears highly luminous due to relativistic beaming, suggesting that most ultraviolet-bright quasars at this redshift host jets. Alternatively, if J0410−0139 represents an intrinsically powerful radio source, there should be hundreds to thousands of radio-quiet quasars atz≈ 7 with properties like those of J0410−0139, a prediction in tension with observed quasar densities based on their ultraviolet luminosity function. These results support the hypothesis that the rapid growth of black holes in the early Universe may be driven by jet-enhanced or obscured super-Eddington accretion, potentially playing a key role in forming massive black holes during the epoch of reionization.
The first James Webb Space Telescope/MIRI photometric observations of TRAPPIST-1 b allowed for the detection of the thermal emission of the planet at 15 μm, suggesting that the planet could be a bare rock with a zero albedo and no redistribution of heat. These observations at 15 μm were acquired as part of Guaranteed Time Observer time that included a twin programme at 12.8 μm to obtain measurements inside and outside the CO2absorption band. Here we present five new occultations of TRAPPIST-1 b observed with MIRI in an additional photometric band at 12.8 μm. We perform a global fit of the ten eclipses and derive a planet-to-star flux ratio and 1σerror of 452 ± 86 ppm and 775 ± 90 ppm at 12.8 μm and 15 μm, respectively. We find that two main scenarios emerge. An airless planet model with an unweathered (fresh) ultramafic surface, that could be indicative of relatively recent geological processes, fits the data well. Alternatively, a thick, pure-CO2atmosphere with photochemical hazes that create a temperature inversion and result in the CO2feature being seen in emission also works, although with some caveats. Our results highlight the challenges in accurately determining a planet’s atmospheric or surface nature solely from broadband filter measurements of its emission, but also point towards two very interesting scenarios that will be further investigated with the forthcoming phase curve of TRAPPIST-1 b.
The total charm-quark production cross section per unit of rapidity\(\textrm{d}\sigma ({{\textrm{c}}\overline{\textrm{c}}})/\textrm{d}y\), and the fragmentation fractions of charm quarks to different charm-hadron species\(f(\textrm{c}\rightarrow {\textrm{h}}_{\textrm{c}})\), are measured for the first time in p–Pb collisions at\(\sqrt{s_\textrm{NN}} = 5.02~\text {Te}\hspace{-1.00006pt}\textrm{V} \)at midrapidity (\(-0.96<y<0.04\)in the centre-of-mass frame) using data collected by ALICE at the CERN LHC. The results are obtained based on all the available measurements of prompt production of ground-state charm-hadron species:\(\textrm{D}^{0}\),\(\textrm{D}^{+}\),\(\textrm{D}_\textrm{s}^{+}\), and\(\mathrm {J/\psi }\)mesons, and\(\Lambda _\textrm{c}^{+}\)and\(\Xi _\textrm{c}^{0}\)baryons. The resulting cross section is\( \textrm{d}\sigma ({{\textrm{c}}\overline{\textrm{c}}})/\textrm{d}y =219.6 \pm 6.3\;(\mathrm {stat.}) {\;}_{-11.8}^{+10.5}\;(\mathrm {syst.}) {\;}_{-2.9}^{+8.3}\;(\mathrm {extr.})\pm 5.4\;(\textrm{BR})\pm 4.6\;(\mathrm {lumi.}) \pm 19.5\;(\text {rapidity shape})+15.0\;(\Omega _\textrm{c}^{0})\;\textrm{mb} \), which is consistent with a binary scaling of pQCD calculations from pp collisions. The measured fragmentation fractions are compatible with those measured in pp collisions at\(\sqrt{s} = 5.02\)and 13 TeV, showing an increase in the relative production rates of charm baryons with respect to charm mesons in pp and p–Pb collisions compared with\(\mathrm {e^{+}e^{-}}\)and\(\mathrm {e^{-}p}\)collisions. The\(p_\textrm{T}\)-integrated nuclear modification factor of charm quarks,\(R_\textrm{pPb}({\textrm{c}}\overline{\textrm{c}})= 0.91 \pm 0.04\;\mathrm{(stat.)} ^{+0.08}_{-0.09}\;\mathrm{(syst.)} ^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\;\mathrm{(extr.)} \pm 0.03\;\mathrm{(lumi.)}\), is found to be consistent with unity and with theoretical predictions including nuclear modifications of the parton distribution functions.
We study the propagation of massless fermionic fields, implementing a family of special functions: Heun functions, in solving the wave equation in three three-dimensional backgrounds, including the BTZ black hole in string theory and Lifshitz black hole solutions in conformal gravity and Hu–SawickiF(R) theory. The main properties of the selected black hole solutions is that their line elements are Weyl related to that of a homogeneous spacetime, whose spatial part possesses Lie symmetry, described by Lobachevsky-type geometry with arbitrary negative Gaussian curvature. Using the Weyl symmetry of massless Dirac action, we consider the perturbation equations of fermionic fields in relation to those of the homogeneous background, which having definite singularities, are transformed into Heun’s equation. We point out the existence of quasinormal modes labeled by the accessory parameter of the Heun function. The distribution of the quasinormal modes has been clarified to satisfy the boundary conditions that require ingoing and decaying waves at the event horizon and conformal infinity, respectively. It turned out that the procedure based on the Heun function, beside reproducing the previously known results obtained via hypergeometric function for the BTZ and Lifshitz black hole solution in conformal gravity, brings up new families of quasinormal frequencies, which can also contain purely imaginary modes. Also, the analysis of the quasinormal modes shows that with the negative imaginary part of complex frequencies\(\omega =\omega _{Re}+i\omega _{Im}\), the fermionic perturbations are stable in this background.
We investigate the impact of incorporating vector-like leptons into the Standard Model, aiming to address longstanding puzzles related to the anomalous magnetic moments of the muon and electron while maintaining consistency with neutrino masses and mixings. We find that among the various representations of vector-like leptons permitted by the Standard Model gauge symmetry, only weak doublets and singlets offer satisfactory solutions, all associated with a significantly constrained parameter space. Our analysis delves into the associated parameter space, identifying representative benchmark scenarios suitable for collider studies. These setups yield a distinctive six-lepton signature whose associated signals can easily be distinguished from the Standard Model background, providing a clear signal indicative of new physics models featuring vector-like leptons. Our work hence sheds light on the potential implications of vector-like leptons in resolving discrepancies inherent to the Standard Model, while also offering insights into experimental avenues for further exploration.
In this paper, the nonfactorizable photonic corrections to the effective four-fermion vertex for the\(\overline{B}\)\({\rightarrow }\)\(D^{({*})}\)\(+\)\({\ell }^{-}\)\(+\)\(\bar{\nu }_{\ell }\)decays are considered at the quark level within SM, where\({\ell }\)\(=\)e,\({\mu }\)and\({\tau }\). It is found that the QED corrections are closely related with the mass of the charged lepton. The QED contributions will enhance branching ratios, which results in the slight reduction of ratios\(R(D^{(*)})\)and the relationship\(R(D^{(*)})_{e}\)<\(R(D^{(*)})_{\mu }\).
A particular extension of Einstein’s General Relativity up to and including quartic terms in the curvature tensor is minimal in the sense that it has a unique maximally symmetric vacuum and only a massless spin-2 excitation in its spectrum around the vacuum. We study the inflation phase of the universe in this minimal quartic extension of Einstein’s gravity in the presence of trace anomaly terms coming from the Standard Model fields and the fields of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We show that the theory allows a quasi-de Sitter phase with sufficiente-foldings.
This work examines the dynamical mass generation for the photon in Rarita–Schwinger QED. We focus our attention on the cases of\(\omega =2,3\)dimensional spacetime. In these frameworks, it is well known that in the usual QED, the photon field (dynamically) acquires a gauge invariant mass (the Schwinger and Chern–Simons mass, respectively). We wish to scrutinize this phenomenon in terms of the Rarita–Schwinger fields. The presence of higher-derivative terms is shown as the leading contributions to the 1PI function\(\langle AA \rangle \)at one-loop order. We study the pole structure of the photon’s complete propagator to unveil the main effects of the Rarita–Schwinger fields on the photon’s mass. In addition, we present some remarks about the renormalizability of this model (in different dimensions) due to the presence of higher-derivative corrections at one-loop.
In this paper, we explore a stationary BTZ space-time within the framework of modified gravity theory, specifically focusing on Ricci-inverse gravity. It is important to clarify that “Ricci-inverse” refers to the inverse of the Ricci tensor, not the Ricci scalar. We consider a general class of this gravity theory, where the functionfis defined by\(f({\mathcal {R}}, {\mathcal {A}}, A^{\mu \nu }\,A_{\mu \nu })\), with\({\mathcal {R}}\)and\({\mathcal {A}}\)representing the Ricci and anti-curvature scalars, respectively and\(A^{\mu \nu }\)is the anti-curvature tensor. We demonstrate that stationary BTZ space-time is a valid solution in this gravity theory, wherein the cosmological constant undergoes modifications due to the coupling constants. Moreover, we study another modified gravity theory known as\(f({\mathcal {R}})\)-gravity and analyze the stationary BTZ space-time. Subsequently, we fully integrate the geodesic equations for BTZ space-time constructed within the Ricci-Inverse gravity, expressing the solutions in terms of elementary functions and compared with the GR result. We classify different types of geodesics, including null and time-like geodesics, under three conditions: (i) nonzero mass and angular momentum,\(M \ne 0, J\ne 0\), (ii) massless BTZ space-time,\(M=0\)and\(J=0\), and (iii)\(M=-1, J=0\), that is\(AdS_3\)-type, and analyze the results in modified gravity theories and compare with the general relativity case.
Neutral current Drell–Yan (DY) lepton-pair production is considered to studyZ-boson quark couplings. Using the open-source fit platformxFitter, we investigate the impact of high-statistics measurements of the neutral current DY (NCDY) forward–backward asymmetry\(A_{\textrm{FB}}\)near the weak boson mass scale in the present and forthcoming stages of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Besides recovering earlier results on the\(A_{\textrm{FB}}\)sensitivity to parton distribution functions, we analyze the precision determination ofZ-boson couplings to left-handed and right-handedu-quarks andd-quarks, and explore Beyond-Standard-Model contributions using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. We perform a sensitivity study and comment on the role of the\(A_{\textrm{FB}}\)asymmetry for the electroweak SMEFT fit and precisionZ-boson physics at the LHC and high-luminosity HL-LHC.
Charmonium production cross-section in proton–proton collisions is measured at the centre-of-mass energy\(\sqrt{s}=13\,\textrm{TeV}\)using decays to\(p\bar{p}\)final state. The study is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\(2.2\,\textrm{fb}^{-1}\)collected in 2018 with the\(\text{ LHCb }\)detector. The production cross-section of the\(\eta _c\)meson is measured in a rapidity range of\(2.0< y < 4.0\)and in a transverse momentum range of\(5.0< p_{\textrm{T}} < 20.0\,\textrm{GeV}\!/\!{ c}\), which is extended compared with previous\(\text{ LHCb }\)analyses. The differential cross-section is measured in bins of\(p_\mathrm{{T}}\)and, for the first time, ofy. Upper limits, at 90% and 95% confidence levels, on the\(\eta _c(2S)\)and\(h_c(1P)\)prompt production cross-sections are determined for the first time.
This paper investigates the structure and stability of wormholes within the framework of Finsler–Barthel–Randers geometry, focusing on the influence of different density models. Finsler geometry, as a generalization of Riemannian geometry, allows for the incorporation of anisotropic characteristics, making it a valuable tool in exploring cosmological phenomena. By employing osculating Riemannian space approaches, we develop wormhole models under non-commutative geometry and power-law energy density distributions. We analyze the role of the Finsler parameter\(\eta \)while evaluating the energy conditions in each model. The specific models developed here with Finsler geometry offer insights into the physical viability of wormholes in this context, potentially resolving some of the longstanding issues in wormhole theory. These findings suggest that Finsler geometry, combined with osculating Barthel–Randers geometry, provides a promising avenue for the construction of stable and physically plausible wormhole structures, The results are validated through analytical solutions and 3-D visualizations, thus contributing to our broader understanding of gravitational physics and spacetime geometry.
This research paper delves into examining the Hayward black hole structure surrounded by quintessence within the framework of Finsler geometry. Our focus centers on the Finsler metric tensor development for black holes. This newly derived metric introduces significant deviations from regular black hole metrics found in general relativity due to the Finslerian term\(\gamma \)presence, thus shedding fresh insights into the geometry and nature of black holes. Our findings reveal that the metric structure aligns closely with known Riemannian limits, affirming the congeniality of our model with existing theories. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to derive critical mass values and determine the normalization factor for the Hayward black hole within the Finlserian framework. The study encompasses a detailed description of the horizons and extremal conditions of the Hayward black hole surrounded by quintessence and the impact of the Finsler parameter\(\gamma \)on them. Specifically, we explore the case where the quintessence state parameter is set to\(\omega = -2/3\). Our analysis delves into the effective potential, providing insights into null geodesics for various energy levels and examining the behavior of horizons by utilizing the definition of the effective potential. We also discuss the impact of\(\gamma \)for the same. We compute and analyze the radius of circular orbits, the period, the instability characteristics of circular orbits, and the force acting on photons with the newly introduced parameter\(\gamma \)within the quintessence field. We have thoroughly looked over the obtained results and discussed them. Additionally, we explore the shadow of the black hole in this context. Thereby, the validity and consistency of our Finslerian model are strengthened. In addition to increasing our understanding of black hole physics, this study paves the way for further research in the Finsler geometry domain and its applications in astrophysics.
In a recent work (Del Piano et al. in Phys Rev D 109(2):024045, 2024), we have described spherically symmetric and static quantum black holes as deformations of the classical Schwarzschild metric that depend on the physical distance to the horizon. We have developed a framework that allows us to compute the latter in a self-consistent fashion from the deformed geometry, in the vicinity of the horizon. However, in this formalism, the distance can be replaced by other physical quantities, e.g. curvature invariants such as the Ricci- or Kretschmann scalar. Here, we, therefore, define a more general framework, which we call aneffective metric description(EMD), that captures the deformed geometry based on a generic physical quantity. We develop in detail the Ricci- and Kretschmann scalar EMD, in particular demonstrating how to compute the geometry in a self-consistent manner. Moreover, we provide explicit relations that allow us to express one EMD  in terms of the others, thus demonstrating their equivalence.
The singularity problem has always been a key focus of physicists’ research. To address this issue, Penrose proposed the cosmic censorship conjecture, with the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (SCCC) being particularly crucial. However, verifying SCCC in different scenarios still faces many challenges. This paper, set against the background of short-hair black holes, explores whether they obey SCCC when subjected to scalar field perturbations. Using the WKB method, Prony method, Lyapunov exponent, and Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), the behavior of a short-hair black hole under different parameter conditions was systematically analyzed. Numerical results indicate that as the charge\( Q \)of the short-hair black hole approaches its extremal value, the SCCC is violated. However, as the order\( k \)of the metric equation and the angular quantum number\( \ell \)increase, the violation of SCCC is delayed. These results suggest that the proximity of the black hole’s charge\( Q \)to its extremal value, along with the size of the angular quantum number\( \ell \)and the order\( k \), play key roles in exploring the physical properties of black holes and verifying SCCC. Finally, research using the WGC shows that when the charge-to-mass ratio in a scalar field meets certain conditions, short-hair black holes can still comply with the SCCC under extreme conditions. This study not only reveals the behavior of short-hair black holes in extreme situations but also offers a new perspective for further exploration of such black holes.
Interest on the possible future scenarios the universe could have has grew substantially with breakthroughs on late-time acceleration. Holographic dark energy (HDE) presents a very interesting approach towards addressing late-time acceleration, presenting an intriguing interface of ideas from quantum gravity and cosmology. In this work we present an extensive discussion of possible late-time scenarios, focusing on rips and similar events, in a universe with holographic dark energy. We discuss these events in the realm of the generalized Nojiri–Odintsov cutoff and also for the more primitive holographic cutoffs like Hubble, particle and event horizon cutoffs. We also discuss the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics and various energy conditions in these regimes. Our work points towards the idea that it is not possible to have alternatives of the big rip consistently in the simpler HDE cutoffs, and shows the flexibility of the generalized HDE cutoff as well.
I study an extended theory of General Relativity that incorporates normalized relativistic velocities, where the boundary terms in the variedf(R)-action are considered as a part of the physical system to be studied. Within this context, I investigate how the classical perturbations can be originated by quantum geometric perturbations, that alters the dynamics of the physical system without perturbations. To do it we use a modified nonlinear quantum algebra recently introduced. The quantum field perturbations of space-time also alter the geodesic equations that describe the dynamics of the relativistic  velocities, the metric tensor and the Ricci tensor. But perhaps the most intriguing of this phenomena is that these space-time alterations change the effective number of space-time dimensions of the system with perturbations includedN(z), in a such manner thatN(z) can take an irrational value\(N(z=2)=8/(1+\sqrt{5})\simeq 2.4721\), when the nonlinear quantum perturbations of space-time are related to the relativistic velocities\(\bar{U}^{\mu }\). To illustrate the theory, we calculate exactly the cosmological parameter in an early inflationary universe.
In this work, we have studied the vector scotogenic model in the context of the dark matter problem. Due to unitarity considerations, we have focused on the scenario with fermion dark matter, finding out that co-annihilations play a fundamental role in achieving dark matter relic abundance. Moreover, the coannihilation effects allow to separate the parameter space into two regions with different phenomenology. In addition, we have studied the detection prospects of these regions separately, focusing on signatures that can appear in lepton flavor violating decays, indirect and direct searches, and the production of these new particles at collider facilities.
Recent conjectures on the complexity of black holes suggest that their evolution manifests in the structural properties of Einstein-Rosen bridges, like the length and volume. The complexity of black holes relates to the computational complexity of their dual, namely holographic, quantum systems identified via the Gauge/Gravity duality framework. Interestingly, the latter allows us to study the evolution of a black hole as the transformation of a qubit collection performed through a quantum circuit. In this work, we focus on the complexity of Einstein-Rosen bridges. More in detail, we start with a preliminary discussion about their computational properties, and then we aim to assess whether an Ising-like model could represent their holographic dual. In this regard, we recall that the Ising model captures essential aspects of complex phenomena such as phase transitions and, in general, is deeply related to information processing systems. To perform this assessment, which relies on a heuristic model, we attempt to describe the dynamics of information relating to an Einstein-Rosen bridge encoded in a holographic screen in terms of dynamics occurring in a spin lattice at low temperatures. We conclude by discussing our observations and related implications.
We construct a new class of\((n+1)\)-dimensional Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions in the presence of the cubic quasitopological gravity for a flat boundary. The related action supports asymptotically Lifshitz solutions by applying some conditions which are used throughout the paper. We have to add a new boundary term and some new counterterms to the bulk action to have finite solutions. Then we define a finite stress tensor complex by which we can calculate the energy density of the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. It is not possible to obtain analytical solutions, and so we use some expansions to probe -the behaviors of the functions, both near the horizon and, at the infinity. Combining the equations, we can attain a total constant along the coordinater. At the horizon, this constant is proportional to the product of the temperature and the entropy and at the infinity, the total constant shows the energydensity of the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. Therefore, we can reach a relation between the conserved quantities temperature, entropy and the energy density and get a smarr-type formula. Using the first law of thermodynamics, we can find a relation between the entropy and the temperature and then obtain the heat capacity. Our results show that the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions are thermally stable for each positive value of the dynamical critiacl exponent,z.
The projected sensitivity of the effective electron neutrino-mass measurement with the KATRIN experiment is below 0.3 eV (90 % CL) after 5 years of data acquisition. The sensitivity is affected by the increased rate of the background electrons from KATRIN’s main spectrometer. A special shifted-analysing-plane (SAP) configuration was developed to reduce this background by a factor of two. The complex layout of electromagnetic fields in the SAP configuration requires a robust method of estimating these fields. We present in this paper a dedicated calibration measurement of the fields using conversion electrons of gaseous\(^\textrm{83m}\)Kr, which enables the neutrino-mass measurements in the SAP configuration.
In order to investigate how the drag force is affected by translational symmetry breaking (TSB), we utilize a holographic model in which the background metric remains translational symmetric while a graviton mass or other fields in the theory break this symmetry. We calculate analytically the drag force, considering an asymptotic\(\hbox {AdS}_5\)in which parameter\(\alpha \)arises from TSB. This parameter can be intuitively understood as a measure of TSB strength and we anticipate that non-zero values of it will affect the drag force. In this asymptotic\(\hbox {AdS}_5\)background, we will demonstrate that a decrease in\(\alpha \)results in a reduction of the drag force. Moreover, we study the diffusion constant, which falls with increasing\(\alpha \). It will eventually be shown that at lower values of\(\alpha \)or\(\mu \)(chemical potential), the transverse diffusion coefficient is larger than the longitudinal one, and the speed of the heavy quark has minimal impact on the ratio.
The polarizabilities of light pseudoscalar mesons can be extracted from differential cross sections for Compton scattering near threshold. While this has been accomplished for charged pions employing Primakoff reactions, a corresponding measurement for kaons will be affected by the presence of the\(K^*(892)\)resonance not too far from threshold. We propose a method to extend the energy range serviceable for this purpose by reconstructing the\(K^*(892)\)contribution model-independently from its\(K\pi \)intermediate state, using dispersion theory. We point out that, in contrast to the charged-pion analog, there is likely no strong hierarchy between sum and difference of electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities; we discuss the sensitivity to disentangling both by improved experimental angular coverage.
The scalar mode describing the fluctuation of the 3-brane (the observable universe) in a five-dimensional bulk spacetime compactified on a circle is absorbed by the Kaluza–Klein U(1) gauge field, leading to a massive brane-vector living on the 3-brane. The brane-vector can be responsible for dark matter because it is odd under a\(\textrm{Z}_2\)symmetry, neutral under the Standard Model (SM) symmetries, and couples extremely weak to the SM particles due to its gravitational origin. Interestingly, the brane-vector dark matter could leave particular imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the primordial gravitational waves. Hence, the precise measurements of the CMB and the observations of the primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation can provide a potential way to probe the extra-dimensions and branes which are the main ingredients of string/M theory.
Examining the\(\phi ^{4}\)and\(\phi ^{8}\)models within a two-dimensional framework in the flat spacetime and embracing a theory with unconventional kinetic terms, one investigates the emergence of kinks/antikinks and double-kinks/antikinks. We devote our study to obtaining the field configurations with minimal energy, i.e., solutions possessing a Bogomol’nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield’s bound. Next, to accomplish our goal, we adopt non-polynomial generalizing functions, namely, hyperbolic sine and cosine functions: the first produce BPS potentials exhibiting a minimum at\(\phi =0\), facilitating the emergence of genuine double-kink-type configurations. Conversely, the second promotes the rise of kink-type solutions.
A search is reported for charge-parity\(CP\)violation in\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} \)decays, using data collected in proton–proton collisions at\(\sqrt{s} = 13\,\text {Te}\hspace{-.08em}\text {V} \)recorded by the CMS experiment in 2018. The analysis uses a dedicated data set that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 41.6\(\,\text {fb}^{-1}\), which consists of about 10 billion events containing a pair of b hadrons, nearly all of which decay to charm hadrons. The flavor of the neutral D meson is determined by the pion charge in the reconstructed decays\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{*+}}} \rightarrow {{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} {{{\mathrm{\uppi }}}^{{+}}} \)and\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{*-}}} \rightarrow {\overline{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} {{{\mathrm{\uppi }}}^{{-}}} \). The\(CP\)asymmetry in\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} \)is measured to be\(A_{CP} ({{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} ) = (6.2 \pm 3.0 \pm 0.2 \pm 0.8)\%\), where the three uncertainties represent the statistical uncertainty, the systematic uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the measurement of the\(CP\)asymmetry in the\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} {{{\mathrm{\uppi }}}^{{+}}} {{{\mathrm{\uppi }}}^{{-}}} \)decay. This is the first\(CP\)asymmetry measurement by CMS in the charm sector as well as the first to utilize a fully hadronic final state.
We propose a consistent framework with theU(1) Peccei–Quinn (PQ) symmetry for obtaining the initial condition for axion kinetic misalignment from inflation. We introduce a PQ complex scalar field and an extra Higgs doublet, which are conformally coupled to gravity, and three right-handed neutrinos for the seesaw mechanism. In the DFSZ type scenarios for the axion, we obtain the PQ anomalies from the Standard Model quarks carrying nonzero PQ charges in some of two Higgs doublet models, solving the strong CP problem by the QCD potential for the axion. Assuming that the PQ symmetry is explicitly violated in the scalar potential by quantum gravity effects, we show that a sufficiently large initial axion velocity can be obtained before the QCD phase transition while avoiding the axion quality problem. As inflation is driven by the radial distance from the origin in the space of scalar fields close to the pole of the kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, we obtain successful inflationary predictions and set the initial axion velocity at the end of inflation. Focusing on the pure PQ inflation with a small running quartic coupling for the PQ field, we discuss the post-inflationary dynamics for the inflaton and the axion. As a result, we show that a sufficiently high reheating temperature can be obtained dominantly from the Higgs-portal couplings to the PQ field, while being consistent with axion kinetic misalignment, the stability for the Higgs fields during inflation and the non-restoration of the PQ symmetry after reheating.
General expressions for one-loop contributions associated with lepton-flavor violating decays of the standard model-like Higgs boson\(h\rightarrow e_b^\pm e_a^\mp \)and gauge boson\(Z\rightarrow e^\pm _b e_a^\mp \)are introduced in the unitary gauge. The results are used to discuss these decays as new physics signals in a minimal left-right symmetric model containing only one bidoublet Higgs and a\(SU(2)_R\)Higgs doublet accommodating data of neutrino oscillations and\((g-2)_{\mu }\). The numerical investigation indicates that some of these decay rates can reach near future experimental sensitivities.
We investigate the effects of a gravitational wave background on the coherence degradation induced by the Unruh effect of a uniformly accelerated single-qubit and quantum interferometric circuit. In both systems, we use the formalism of the evolution of the density matrix of the detector-field system, where after the interaction the field degrees of freedom are traced out to obtain the reduced density matrix of the detector. In this background, we calculate the quantum coherence and interferometric visibility in the long-wavelength regime and large interaction time. Our results indicate that the gravitational wave transfers energy to the internal states of the detector, causing, together with the Unruh effect, changes in them, amplifying the coherence degradation of the system. This amplification occurs when the polarization modes of the gravitational wave are in resonance and have modulated amplitudes. For the case of a short-wavelength, the detector does not respond to the gravitational wave because its oscillation is so fast that the detector does not have time to respond within the system timescale. Therefore, it is possible to detect the signature of gravitational waves in the coherence degradation induced by the Unruh effect within the regimes studied here.
We study supersymmetric solutions of matter-coupledF(4) gauged supergravity in the forms of\(AdS_2\times S^3\)- and\(AdS_3\times S^2\)-sliced domain walls with a non-vanishing two-form field from the supergravity multiplet. These two types of solutions holographically describe conformal line and surface defects within five-dimensional\(N=2\)SCFTs, respectively. In the case of\(SO(3)\times SO(3)\)gauge group obtained by couplingF(4) supergravity to three vector multiplets, we find charged domain wall solutions describing holographic RG flows between two supersymmetric\(AdS_6\)vacua with a running two-form field supporting the line and surface defects. For a particular case of one vector multiplet with\(SO(3)\times U(1)\)gauge group, we find solutions describing RG flows from an\(AdS_6\)vacuum to physically acceptable singular geometries in the presence of defects. This class of solutions can be uplifted to type IIB theory using a consistent truncation obtained fromSO(5, 5) exceptional field theory with half-maximal structures.
The CONUS+experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE\(\nu \)NS) of reactor antineutrinos on germanium nuclei in the fully coherent regime, continuing on this way the CONUS physics program started at the Brokdorf nuclear power plant, Germany. The CONUS+setup is installed in the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland, at a distance of 20.7 m from the 3.6 GW thermal power reactor core. The CE\(\nu \)NS signature will be measured with the same four point-contact high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors produced for the former experiment, however refurbished and with optimized low energy thresholds of about 160\(\hbox {eV}_{ee}\). To suppress the background in the CONUS+detectors, the passive and active layers of the original CONUS shield were modified such to fit better to the significantly changed background conditions at the new experimental location. New data acquisition and monitoring systems were developed. A direct network connection between the experiment and the Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik (MPIK) makes it possible to control and monitor data acquisition in real time. The impact of all these modifications is discussed with particular emphasis on the resulting CE\(\nu \)NS signal prediction for the first data collection phase of CONUS+. Prospects of the planned upgrade in a second phase integrating new larger HPGe detectors are also discussed.
In this work, we study timelike and lightlike geodesics in Kalb–Ramond (KR) gravity around a black hole with the goal of constraining the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameterl. The analysis involves studying the precession of the S2 star periastron orbiting Sgr A* and geodesic precession around the Earth. The ratio of precession frequencies for General Relativity (GR) and KR gravity is computed, with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results providing a parameter range for the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of\(-0.185022 \le l \le 0.060938\). Utilizing the geodesic precession frequency from the Gravity Probe B (GP-B), thelparameter is further constrained to\(-6.30714 \times 10^{-12} \le l \le 3.90708 \times 10^{-12}\), which is consistent with the Schwarzschild limits. Moreover, for timelike geodesics, the innermost circular orbit (ICO) and innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are determined and analyzed to illustrate the impact of the symmetry breaking term. Zoom-whirl obstructions are compared with the Schwarzschild solution. Lower and upper limits of the photon sphere for lightlike geodesics are established to demonstrate the influence of KR gravity on the photon sphere. Additionally, the shadow radius is determined for two observers, one situated at a finite distance from the KR black hole, and the other located at an infinite distance, to constrain the symmetry-breaking parameterl, with comparisons made to EHT results. The bounds forlderived from constraints on the photon sphere radius for lightlike geodesics yield\(-0.0700225 \le l \le 0.189785\)using EHT data. The findings of this paper align with experimental results in the\(l \rightarrow 0\)limit.
AbstractWave trains of magnetic field and ion-flux oscillations generated upstream of the ramp of interplanetary (IP) shock were studied according to BMSW plasma-spectrometer measurements of energy–time spectra of the solar-wind ions supplemented by magnetic-field measurements. It was shown that oscillations of the magnetic field upstream of the ramp of IP shock are accompanied by oscillations of the ion flux. A detailed analysis of two cases is carried out, and the results of statistical study are presented. Right-handed circular or elliptical polarization was observed in all wave trains of magnetic-field oscillations, which is consistent with the characteristics of magnetosonic oscillations corresponding to the low-frequency branch of whistler waves. It was obtained that the mean angles between the propagation direction of whistler waves relative to the magnetic field and shock normal direction were 31° and 40°, respectively. This result suggests that the wave packets upstream of the ramp of IP shock had the properties of propagating whistler waves. It was found that, on average, with an increase in the angle of propagation of whistler waved relative to the shock normal direction θkn, the angle between the wave vector and magnetic-field direction θkBdecreases.
AbstractIn this paper, a preliminary ballistic analysis for an Earth magnetosphere monitoring mission is conducted. Spacecraft mass and propulsion system characteristics are specified to satisfy current technological requirements. Low Earth, Sun-synchronous, and geosynchronous transfer orbits are considered as initial orbits. The target orbits are specified in accordance with scientific tasks. The fuel cost and transfer duration are estimated by two methods: an upper bound from the Lyapunov control method and a lower bound from energy-optimal control problem solution. The relationship between optimal longitudes of the ascending nodes for initial and target orbits is examined. The fuel cost estimates validate the feasibility of the mission based on small spacecraft and on the market low-thrust electric engines.
AbstractMeasurements of heavy (M/q> 3) ions on thePhobos-2satellite revealed that the density of these ions in the central plasma sheet of the areomagnetic tail is proportional to the proton density of the solar wind flowing around the planet.ISEE-2ion measurements in the near-Earth plasma sheet close to the neutral line were also compared to solar wind data obtained on theISEE-3satellite. It was found that the density of protons in the near-Earth plasma sheet is proportional to the density of solar wind protons as well. Analysis of the magnetic and plasma pressure balance in the solar wind and inside the magnetotails of the Earth and Mars showed that the previously found correlations are the result of the necessary equality of pressures at the magnetosphere boundary and inside the magnetic tails of the planets.
We discuss a general prototypical constrained Hamiltonian system with a broad application in quantum field theory and similar contexts where dynamics is defined through a functional action obeying a stationarity principle. The prototypical model amounts to a Dirac–Bergmann singular system, whose constraints restrict the actual dynamics to occur within a differential submanifold, as is the case in the major part of field theoretical models with gauge symmetry. We apply the Dirac–Bergmann algorithm in its full generality unraveling a total of 4msecond-class constraints and obtain the corresponding Dirac brackets algebra in phase space. We follow with the Faddeev–Jackiw–Barcelos–Wotzasek approach in which the geometric character of the mentioned submanifold is emphasized by means of an internal metric function encoding its symplectic properties. We consider two straightforward examples, applying our general results to constrained motion along a toroidal geometry and to a Lorentz violating toy model in field theory. Since toroidal geometry has been recently used in cosmological models, we suggest how our results could lead to different proposals for the shape of the universe in cosmology.
AbstractThe lunar surface in the vicinity of the poles has special properties compared to the surface at the equator and at moderate latitudes. First, the polar regolith contains quite a large amount of water ice, which significantly affects the neutron radiation generated under the influence of galactic cosmic rays. Second, the temperature of the polar regolith can have extremely low values of about 25 K, as a result of which the thermal component of the neutron flux is partially held in the gravitational field. Based on numerical modeling of neutron radiation from the lunar surface, its main features were shown for the polar regions compared to the equatorial ones: a significant decrease in the ratio of epithermal and thermal neutron fluxes due to an increase in the concentration of hydrogen in the regolith, as well as a significant increase in the density of thermal neutrons near the surface due to gravitational capture.
We revisit an economical model for the\(g-2\)anomaly featuring a vector-like charged fermion, a scalar doublet and a scalar singlet in the light of new results from Fermilab. The phenomenological implications for lepton-flavor universality, Higgs decays, and charged lepton-flavor violating decays are discussed in detail.
This paper formulates three different analytical solutions to the gravitational field equations in the framework of Rastall theory by taking into account the gravitational decoupling approach. For this, the anisotropic spherical interior fluid distribution is assumed as a seed source characterized by the corresponding Lagrangian. The field equations are then modified by introducing an additional source which is gravitationally coupled with the former fluid setup. Since this approach makes the Rastall equations more complex, the MGD scheme is used to tackle this, dividing these equations into two systems. Some particular ansatz are taken into account to solve the first system, describing initial anisotropic fluid. These metric potentials contain multiple constants which are determined with the help of boundary conditions. On the other hand, the solution for the second set is calculated through different well-known constraints. Afterwards, the estimated data of a pulsar 4U 1820-30 is considered so that the feasibility of the developed models can be checked graphically. It is concluded that all resulting models show physically acceptable behavior under certain choices of Rastall and decoupling parameters.
Recently, the Belle and LHCb Collaborations have measured the\(\Lambda ^+_c \rightarrow p K^- \pi ^+\)decay and reported the\(K^- p\)invariant mass distribution, which shows a clear cusp structure around the\(\eta \Lambda \)threshold. In this work, we have analyzed this process by considering the triangle mechanism and theS-wave pseudoscalar meson-octet baryon interactions within the chiral unitary approach, which dynamically generates the\(\Lambda (1670)\). Our results are in good agreement with the Belle measurements, which implies that the cusp structure around\(\eta \Lambda \)threshold could be associated with the\(\Lambda (1670)\)with the molecular nature.
AbstractThe study of precipitation of high-energy electrons from the magnetosphere into the Earth’s atmosphere is important for studying the physical mechanisms of electron acceleration during interplanetary disturbances in near-Earth space, the processes of formation of trapped electron fluxes in the magnetosphere and their subsequent precipitation into the atmosphere. In addition, the precipitating electrons affect the spacecraft operation and often lead to significant destruction of mesospheric ozone, etc. Since 1957, the Dolgoprudny Scientific Station of the Lebedev Physical Institute has been conducting continuous measurements of cosmic ray fluxes at altitudes of 0–30 km in the atmosphere of polar latitudes (Murmansk oblast, Antarctica) and at middle latitude (Moscow oblast). During this time, almost 600 cases of electron precipitation were recorded, mainly from the Earth’s outer radiation belt near its polar boundary due to measurement in Murmansk oblast. At the same time, several cases of electron precipitation were recorded at mid-latitude (Moscow oblast) and at the Mirny station in Antarctica, in particular, in 2022–2023. The paper discusses interplanetary and geomagnetic conditions during these events. Analysis of measurement data in the stratosphere made it possible to establish the absorption spectra of secondary bremsstrahlung photons and, on their basis, using the method we developed, to determine the primary energy spectra of precipitating magnetospheric electrons.
AbstractWe reportMagnetospheric Multiscale Mission(MMS) observations of accelerated field-aligned electron beams in the outer (\(\left| {{{B}_{x}}} \right| \sim \left( {10{\kern 1pt} - {\kern 1pt} 20} \right)\,\,{\text{nT}}\)) regions of the Plasma Sheet (PS). TheMMSsatellites were located earthward of the magnetic reconnectionX-line, inside of the bursty bulk flow. The interval corresponds to the growth phase of the substorm. Field-aligned electron beams was produced by electrons suprathermal population with energy\( \sim {\kern 1pt} \left( {1{\kern 1pt} - {\kern 1pt} 5} \right)\,\,{\text{keV}}\). Newly accelerated electron beams are gyrotropic. In the process of evolution, agyrotropy of the beam develops. This leads to the generation of intense (up to ∼80 nA/m2) field-aligned currents. We demonstrate that acceleration of the electrons is pulsed for the time\( < {\kern 1pt} 5\,\,~{\text{s}}\). Propagation of the high-velocity electron beam results in the development of plasma instabilities and generation of a strong (∼59 mV/m) nonideal electric field at frequencies lower than electron cyclotron frequency\({{{{\omega }}}_{{c,e}}}\). The presence of a nonideal electric field leads to the violation of the frozen-in condition of electron plasma and energy dissipation. The energy transformation power density reaches ∼–1000 pW/m3. Fluctuations in the spectrum of a nonideal electric field experience spectral flattering between ion plasma\({{{{\omega }}}_{{p,i}}}\)and electron cyclotron\({{{{\omega }}}_{{c,e}}}\)frequencies. This evidences energy transfer from particles to waves at this spectral range. The studied phenomena may provide significant contributions to the development of turbulence on electronic kinetic scales in the outer region of the PS.
AbstractThe paper considers the problem of ensuring stable radio communication during an Earth–Mars flight using relay satellites. We have analyzed the orbits of relay satellites that are in resonance with the Earth–Mars flight trajectory, which makes it possible to provide a channel of communication with Earth for each mission using such trajectory. A single-stage relay scheme is considered using a regenerative transponder that performs complete processing of the received signal, including demodulation, decoding, subsequent coding, modulation, and transfer to the operating frequency. An independent assessment of power budgets of the communication channels “mission-oriented spacecraft–relay satellite” and “relay satellite–ground receiving network” has been performed. The requirements for the possible regions of the relay satellite positioning in the Earth–Mars flight stage are formulated. Families of resonant orbits providing the given quality of communication on the trajectory of the mission-oriented spacecraft using the relay satellite are defined. The most promising variants of relay satellite orbits have been identified based on the following criteria: the maximum transmitted data during the flight and the maximum data rate at the maximum distance from the Earth.
In this paper, we study the dissociation of heavy quarkonium in the spinning black hole background. Specifically, we analyze the spectral function of charmonium and bottomonium in the spinning black hole background and examine how the angular momentum affects the dissociation of\(J/\Psi \)and\(\Upsilon (1S)\). From the results, we find that the angular momentum and temperature decreases the peak height and expands the peak width of the spectral function, thereby enhancing the dissociation of heavy vector mesons. Moreover, the angular momentum has a stronger dissociation effect in the transverse orientation, revealing the directional influence of angular momentum.
AbstractThe article present a list of realistic scientific goals that can be achieved by the complex of modern plasma instruments onboard theVenera-Dspacecraft. Structures and operating principles of three plasma instruments—an ion energy–mass analyzer, electron spectrometer, and energetic neutral-atom detector—are also presented.
AbstractBased on ground-based observations of cosmic rays (CRs) on the global network of neutron monitors, the Yakutsk complex of muon telescopes, and the URAGAN muon hodoscope (Moscow), the spectra of CR variations and anisotropy during the Forbush effects of March 15 and 23, 2023 were calculated using the spectrographic global survey method. It is shown that the spectrum of CR variations during these periods is not described by a power function in a wide range of rigidities. It was found that the Earth was in a loop-shaped structure of the interplanetary magnetic field on March 15 and that it entered a magnetic cloud with closed field lines on March 23.
AbstractThe existence of continuous cooling and heating processes is an important condition governing the behavior of the solar corona, which is characterized by temperatures of several million Kelvin. These processes can be significantly influenced by small-scale coronal formations, which largely determine the thermal balance of the corona and solar-wind disturbances. High-sensitivity observations of polarized radiation allow us to evaluate the complex structure of magnetic fields that accumulate the energy necessary to excite coronal eruptions, bursts and flares. However, at high altitudes the corona becomes optically thin, and observations of it pose a major challenge, requiring the use of instruments with a large effective area. Many researchers note that the emerging field of coronal magnetometry is hard to develop due to the fact that experimental observations in optical range are limited by the low plasma density in the corona, high temperature, and insufficient sensitivity of the instruments. In contrast, higher sensitivity is achievable in the radio frequency range. In particular, the 1–3 GHz range is optimal for detecting very weak coronal structures of emerging activity, despite limitations in spatial resolution. To carry out radio requency observations of the corona on the RATAN-600 large reflector-type radio telescope, a wide-range spectrometer in the range of 1–3 GHz was created. It has continuous coverage of the entire frequency range with maximum frequency and time resolutions, as well as high sensitivity to radiation flux. The results of the first series of observations of weak coronal structures are presented, and their interpretation in terms of their effect on thermal processes in the corona is discussed.
AbstractMMSfour-spacecraft observations with high temporal and spatial resolution made it possible to study the characteristics of intense superthin current sheets (SCSs) with a current densityJ> 30 nA/m2, formed in bursty bulk flows (BBFs), propagating in the Plasma Sheet (PS) of the magnetotail from the remoteXline. Statistical analysis of >1000 SCSs observations showed that, in the majority of cases, the current in the SCSs is parallel to the ambient magnetic field and is carried by field-aligned accelerated electron beams. The half-thickness of the SCSs is several electron gyroradii, and in such thin layers the electric current is carried by demagnetized electrons. Bursts of strong nonideal electric fieldsE' > 10 mV/m are often observed at the edges and/or inside the SCSs. The generation of such fields brings about energy conversion in the SCSs of hundreds of pW/m3, and in some cases up to several nW/m3, which is comparable to the energy conversion in the electron diffusion region of magnetic reconnection. The strongest energy release is observed in the SCSs formed in the fastest BBFs and under strong variations of the magnetic field in the tail lobes.
AbstractThe article presents a brief description of the main scientific objectives of the Solntse–Terahertz project. As part of this project, the Lebedev Physical Institute is manufacturing scientific equipment for installation on the Russian segment of theInternational Space Station. The optical system of each of the eight scientific equipment’s radiation receivers consists of a system of mirrors, an optical chopper, low-pass and bandpass filters. Spectral characteristics were obtained for each element of this system. When calibrating the device, a source—a black-body simulator (BBS)—is used, and, therefore, using numerical integration methods, the intensity of radiation from the BBS that passes through the filter system was calculated. To estimate the characteristic signal from the quiet Sun, the radiation intensity passing through the filter system was calculated using numerical integration methods using the standard ASTM E-490 solar spectrum.
In this paper, we study the scalar and Dirac fields perturbation of Schwarzschild-de Sitter-like black hole in bumblebee gravity model. The effective potentials, greybody factors and quasinormal modes of the black hole are investigated by using the Klein–Gordon equation and Dirac equation. To compute the greybody factors for scalar and Dirac fields, we use the general method of rigorous bound. We also investigate the quasinormal mode using the third order WKB approximation method and Pöschl–Teller fitting method. The impact of Lorentz invariance violation parameterLand cosmological constant\(\varLambda \)to the effective potential, greybody factors and quasinormal modes are analyzed for different modes. Increasing the parameters\(\varLambda \)andLlower the effective potentials and consequently increases the rigorous bound on the greybody factors. Our findings show that the oscillation frequency and the damping rate decrease with increasingL. We analyze the Hawking temperature, power spectrum and sparsity of Hawking radiation. Both the peak of power spectrum and total power emitted decrease with increasingL. The effect ofLon the shadow radius is also discussed.
We present a simple toy model of cosmic acceleration driven purely by a self-interacting scalar field embedded in theory of grand unification. The scalar self-interaction is Higgs-like and provokes a spontaneous symmetry breaking. The coefficient of the quadratic term in the self-interaction potential has an evolution and it leads to a cosmic variation of proton-to-electron mass ratio,\(\mu \). We perform a cosmological reconstruction from the kinematic parameter jerk and discuss a few cosmological consequences of the theory. We also compare the theoretically calculated\(\mu \)variation with the observations of molecular absorption spectra from Cesium Atomic Clock data.
The Tolman–Ehrenfest criterion for the thermal equilibrium of a fluid at rest in a static general-relativistic geometry is generalized to scalar–tensor gravity. Surprisingly, the gravitational scalar field, which fixes the strength of the effective gravitational coupling, does not play a role in determining thermal equilibrium. As a result, heat does not sink more in a gravitational field where gravity is stronger.

In this study, the canonical quantization of the U(1) gauge field in the Lorentz-covariant gauge in the right Rindler-wedge (RRW) of the four-dimensional Rindler coordinates is performed. Specifically, we obtain the gauge-fixed Lagrangian by the Lorentz-covariant gauge in the RRW of the Rindler coordinates, which is composed of the U(1) gauge field andB-field. Then, we obtain the mode-solutions of the U(1) gauge field andB-field by solving the equations of motion obtained from that gauge-fixed Lagrangian. Subsequently, defining the Klein–Gordon inner-product in the RRW of the Rindler coordinates, we determine the normalization constants of all directions of the mode-solutions of the U(1) gauge field andB-field. Then, for the U(1) gauge field given by those normalized mode-expanded solutions, we obtain the commutation relations of the creation and annihilation operators defined in the RRW of the Rindler coordinates by formulating the canonical commutation relations. In addition, we provide a polarization vector for the annihilation operators obtained in this way. Using these result, we show that the Minkowski ground state can be expressed as the outer-product of the left and right Rindler-wedges state on which those creation and annihilation operators act. Then, tracing out the left Rindler states of that Minkowski ground state, we obtain the density matrix of the U(1) gauge field in the RRW. From this, we show that the U(1) gauge field in a constant accelerated system will feel the Unruh temperature as well.
A novel nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) model with two dimensionful parameters is introduced and investigated. Our model obeys the Maxwellian limit and exhibits behaviour similar to the Born–Infeld Lagrangian in the weak field limit. It is shown that the electric field of a point charge in this model has a definite maximum value. Thus, the self-energy of the point charge is finite. The phenomenon of vacuum birefringence is found to occur in the presence of an external uniform electric field. Causality and unitarity conditions for all background electric fields hold, whereas, for magnetic fields, a restricted domain of validity is found. Moreover, a minimal coupling of Einstein’s General Relativity (GR) with this NLE results in solutions of regular black holes or naked singularities, depending on whether the source is a nonlinear magnetic monopole or an electric charge, respectively.
One of the possible ways to test gravity theories and get constraints on parameters of a gravity theory and a black hole is based on studies of black hole shadow applying Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data from the shadow sizes of M87* and Sgr A*. In this sense, we study the shadow of rotating charged black holes in Einstein–Maxwell scalar (EMS) theory. First, we obtain a rotating EMS black hole solution and analyze the horizon properties. We derive the effective potential for the circular motion of photons along null geodesics around the rotating black hole and obtain the black hole shadow using celestial coordinates. The effects of the black charge and spin and EMS theory parameters on the shape of the black hole shadow, its radius, and distortion parameters are analyzed in detail. We have obtained upper and lower limits for spin and black hole charges of Sgr A* and M87* using their shadow size for various values of EMS parameters. Lastly, we computed and examined the standard shadow radius, equatorial, and polar quasinormal modes using the geometric-optic relationship between the parameters of the quasinormal mode and the conserved values along the geodesics.
Venus’s climatic history provides powerful constraints on the location of the inner edge of the liquid-water habitable zone. However, two very different histories of water on Venus have been proposed: one where Venus had a temperate climate for billions of years with surface liquid water and the other where a hot early Venus was never able to condense surface liquid water. Here we offer a constraint on Venus’s climate history by inferring the water content of its interior. By calculating the present rate of atmospheric destruction of H2O, CO2and OCS, which must be restored by volcanism to maintain atmospheric stability, we show that Venus’s interior is dry. Venusian volcanic gases have at most a 6% water mole fraction, which is substantially drier than terrestrial magmas degassed at similar conditions. The dry interior is consistent with Venus ending its magma ocean epoch desiccated and thereafter having had a long-lived dry surface. Volcanic resupply to Venus’s atmosphere, therefore, indicates that the planet has never been liquid-water habitable.
Spontaneous scalarization in Einstein-scalar-Gauss–Bonnet theory admits both vacuum-general relativity (GR) and scalarized hairy black holes as valid solutions, which provides a distinctive signature of new physics in strong gravity regime. In this paper, we shall examine the optical features of Gauss–Bonnet black holes with spontaneous scalarization, which is governed by the coupling parameter\(\lambda \). We find that the photon sphere, critical impact parameter and innermost stable circular orbit all decrease as the increasing of\(\lambda \). Using observable data from Event Horizon Telescope, we establish the upper limit for\(\lambda \). Then we construct the optical appearances of the scalarized black holes illuminated by various thin accretions. Our findings reveal that the scalarized black holes consistently exhibit smaller shadow sizes and reduced brightness compared to Schwarzschild black holes. Notably, in the case of thin spherical accretion, the shadow of the scalarized black hole is smaller, but the surrounding bright ring is more pronounced. Our results highlight the observable features of the scalarized black holes, providing a distinguishable probe from their counterpart in GR in strong gravity regime.
By employing modified Chaplygin fluid prescription for the dark energy, we construct slowly rotating isotropic and anisotropic dark energy stars. The slow rotation is incorporated via general relativistic Hartle–Thorne formalism; whereas the anisotropy is introduced through Bowers–Liang prescription. We consider both the monopole and quadrupole deformations and present a complete analysis of rotating dark energy stars. By numerically solving the rotating stellar structure equations in presence of anisotropy, we analyse and quantify various properties of dark energy stars such as mass (M), radius, mass deformation, angular momentum (J), moment of inertia, and quadrupole moment (Q), for three different equation of state parameters. We find that anisotropic slow rotation results in significant deformation of stellar mass and thereby affects other global properties studied. For the values of angular frequencies considered, the effect of anisotropy on the stellar structure is found to be more prominent than that due to rotation. The dimensionless quadrupole moment\(QM/J^2\)measuring deviation from a Kerr metric black hole was obtained for anisotropic dark energy stars. We observe that dark energy stars with higher anisotropic strength tend to approach the Kerr solution more closely. We report that our results have considerable agreement with various astrophysical observational measurements. We also find that the dimensionless quadrupole moments of anisotropic dark energy stars corresponding to the canonical mass\({\bar{q}}_{1.4}\)have a similar range of values as that of isotropic neutron stars and strange stars.
Quantum coherence, a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, plays a crucial role in various quantum information tasks. However, preserving coherence under extreme conditions, such as relativistic acceleration, poses significant challenges. In this paper, we investigate the influence of Unruh temperature and energy levels on the evolution of maximal steered coherence (MSC) for different initial states. Our results reveal that MSC is strongly dependent on Unruh temperature, exhibiting behaviors ranging from monotonic decline to non-monotonic recovery, depending on the initial state parameter\(\Delta _0\). Notably, when\(\Delta _0=1\), MSC is generated as Unruh temperature increases. Additionally, we observe that higher energy levels help preserve or enhance MSC in the presence of Unruh effects. These findings offer valuable insights into the intricate relationship between relativistic effects and quantum coherence, with potential applications in developing robust quantum technologies for non-inertial environments.
In various fields of mathematical research, the Brouwer degree is a potent tool for topological analysis. By using the Brouwer degree defined in one-dimensional space, we interpret the equation of state for temperature in black hole thermodynamics,\(T=T(V,x_i)\), as a spinodal curve, with its derivative defining a new functionf. The sign of the slope offindicates the topological charge of the black hole’s critical points, and the total topological charge can be deduced from the asymptotic behavior of the functionf. We analyze a spherical hairy black hole within the framework of Lovelock gravity, paying particular attention to the topological structure of black hole thermodynamics under Gauss–Bonnet gravity. Here, the sign of the scalar hair parameter influences the topological classification of uncharged black holes. When exploring the thermodynamic topological properties of hairy black holes under cubic Lovelock gravity, we find that the spherical hairy black hole reproduces the thermodynamic topological classification results seen under Gauss–Bonnet gravity.
An extension of thexFitteropen-source program for QCD analyses is presented, allowing for a polynomial parameterization of the dependence of physical observables on theoretical parameters. This extension enables simultaneous determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and new physics parameters within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The functionalities of the code are illustrated in a sensitivity study, where a simultaneous determination of the PDFs, top quark mass and the couplings of selected dimension-6 SMEFT operators is addressed using projections for measurements of top quark-antiquark pair production at the High-Luminosity LHC. The importance of considering all the correlations of the parton distributions, top quark mass and the SMEFT parameters in a simultaneous QCD+SMEFT analysis is demonstrated. This work serves as a new platform for simultaneous extraction of the PDFs and the SM/SMEFT parameters based onxFitter.
We propose extended 3HDM and 4HDM models where the SM gauge symmetry is enlarged by the spontaneously broken\(S_4\)group, the preserved\(Z_2\)and broken\(Z_4\)cyclic symmetries. Each model has three activeSU(2) scalar doublets, in addition, the first one has an extra inert scalar singlet, whereas the second model has an inert scalar doublet. Furthermore, each model has several extra gauge singlet scalars, which are triplets under\(S_4\). Both models yield the same structure of the mass matrices for the fermion sector, where a radiative seesaw generates the tiny light active neutrino masses at one-loop level, through the\(S_4\)triplets. The presence of flavor changing neutral currents mediated by heavy scalars allowed us to study the\((K^0-\overline{K}^0)\)and\((B_{d,s}^0-\overline{B}_{d,s}^0)\)meson mixings, in the parameter space that currently satisfies the experimental constraints. On the other hand, due to the preserved\(Z_2\)symmetry, our proposed models have stable scalar and fermionic dark matter candidates. Furthermore, these models are consistent with the current pattern of SM fermion masses and mixings, with the measured dark matter relic abundance and successfully accommodate the constraints arising from meson oscillations and oblique parameters. The extra scalars in our models provide radiative corrections to the oblique parameters, where due to the presence of the scalar inert doublet, renders the 4HDM less restrictive than the 3HDM one.
The gravitational field around an astrophysical black hole (BH) is thought to be described by the Kerr spacetime, which is a solution of the Einstein equation. Signatures of binary black hole (BBH) coalescence in gravitational waves (GW) follow the Kerr spacetime as the theoretical foundation. Hence, any possible deviations from the Kerr spacetime around BHs serve as a test of the nature of gravity in the strong-field regime and of the predictions of General Relativity. In our study, we perform a theory-agnostic test of the Kerr hypothesis using BBH inspirals from the third Gravitational-wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). Considering the Johannsen metric, we compute the leading-order deviation to the emitted GW in the frequency domain. Our results provide constraints on two deformation parameters (\(\alpha _{13}\)and\(\epsilon _3\)) and demonstrate the degeneracy between these two non-Kerr parameters.
In the present work, we propose to explore the productions of the bottom and bottom-strange mesons in the high-energy pion and kaon-induced reactions on a proton target. The cross sections are evaluated with an effective Lagrangian constructed by the heavy-quark limit and chiral symmetry. Our estimations show that at\(P_\pi =80\)GeV, the cross sections forB(5279),\(B^*(5325)\),\(B_0^*(5722)\),\(B_1^\prime (5716)\),\(B_1(5721)\)and\(B_2^*(5747)\)production processes are estimated to be 3.19–86.26, 1.86–51.29, 0.88–24.33, 0.86–23.69, 162.35–4477.66, and 57.16–1604.43 nb, respectively, where uncertainties arise from the model parameter. In addition, the cross sections for the corresponding bottom-strange mesons production processes are very similar. From the heavy quark effective theory point of view, the ratios between the cross sections for bottom mesons and bottom-strange mesons should be similar and the present estimations are consistent with the expectation of heavy quark limit. In particular, the cross-section ratios related to the states in the same doublets are of order one. The cross sections related to the states in theTdoublets are about two orders larger than those related to the states in theSdoublets.
The regime of dark matter (DM) freeze-in at stronger coupling interpolates between freeze-in and freeze-out. It relies on Boltzmann-suppressed dark matter production, implying that the Standard Model bath temperature never exceeds the dark matter mass. In this work, we study this regime in the context of sterile neutrino dark matter, which can be sufficiently long-lived for a tiny sterile-active mixing. The sterile neutrino is assumed to couple to a real singlet scalar, providing for a thermal production mechanism of the former. We find that DM mass can range from GeV to tens of TeV consistently with all the constraints. The most interesting aspect of the consequent freeze-in phenomenology is that the sterile neutrino dark matter can be probed efficiently by both direct detection experiments and invisible Higgs decay at the LHC.
In this paper we investigate the shear viscoelasticity and the hydrodynamic modes in a holographic solid model with several sets of axions that all break the translations spontaneously on boundary. Comparing with the single-axion model, the shear modulus is enhanced at high temperatures and the shear viscosity is always suppressed in the presence of additional axions. However, the different sets of axions exhibit competitive relationship in determining the shear modulus at low temperatures. Furthermore, by calculating the black hole quasi-normal modes, it is found that adding more axions only increases the amount of diffusive modes. The number of the sound modes always remains unchanged.
This research paper investigates the impact of non-metricity and matter source on the geometry of charged spheres in the presence of anisotropic matter configuration. We use a specific model of extended symmetric teleparallel theory to minimize the complexity of the field equations. Moreover, the feasible non-singular solutions are used to examine the interior composition of the charged spheres. The Darmois junction conditions are used to determine the unknown constants in the metric coefficients. We explore some significant properties in the interior of compact stars under consideration to check their viable existence in this modified framework. The equilibrium state of the charged spheres is discussed using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation and stability is analyzed by sound speed and Herrera cracking approach. We find that the charged spheres in this theoretical framework are physically viable and stable.
In order to search for new solutions for collapsed objects in quantum gravity, we consider in this paper a Kantowski–Sachs metric labelled by parameters that have no classical significance. In addition, we include a Klein–Gordon field to represent in a simple manner the inevitable zero-point vacuum fluctuations that permeate the spacetime. With this framework, we quantize the system and obtain the Wheeler–DeWitt equation in order to focus upon the deep quantum regime of the interior and to analyze any kind of transition that the black hole may undergo. The Wheeler–DeWitt equation reveals the existence of new solutions of different nature, designated herein as “quantum grey holes,” in addition to the existence of quantum black holes, with all solutions satisfying the DeWitt boundary condition. The existence of new solutions gives rise to the novel possibility of a quantum black hole making a transition to a quantum grey hole. We find that there exists non-zero probability of quantum black-to-grey hole transition. These transition probabilities exhibit resonances for a continuous range of eigenvalues of the system.
Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, as suggested by recent observations, seems to challenge this model, as such galaxies would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars. However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshiftz= 4.90, 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal that the stellar mass of the galaxy of 1011M⊙formed in a short 200 Myr burst of star formation, after which star formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than assumed at present.
In the present work we determine the eight form factors of the transversely-projected quark-gluon vertex in general kinematics, in the context of Landau-gauge QCD with two degenerate light dynamical quarks. The study is based on the set of Schwinger–Dyson equations that govern the vertex form factors, derived within the formalism of the three-particle-irreducible (3PI) effective action. The analysis is performed by employing lattice data for the main ingredients, such as gluon and quark propagators, and three-gluon vertex. The numerical treatment is simplified by decoupling the system of integral equations: the classical form factor is determined from a single non-linear equation involving only itself, while the remaining ones are subsequently computed through simple integrations. The form factors are obtained for arbitrary values of space-like momenta, and their angular dependence is examined in detail. A clear hierarchy is established at the level of the corresponding dimensionless effective couplings, in agreement with results of earlier studies. Furthermore, the classical form factor is found to be in excellent agreement with recent unquenched lattice data in the soft-gluon configuration, while the two non-classical dressings depart substantially from the lattice results. Finally, the accurate implementation of multiplicative renormalizability is confirmed, and the transition from Minkoswski to Euclidean space is elucidated.
Recently, the short-distance asymptotics of the generating functional ofn-point correlators of twist-2 operators in SU(N) Yang–Mills (YM) theory has been worked out in Bochicchio et al. (Phys Rev D 108:054023, 2023). The above computation relies on a basis change of renormalized twist-2 operators, where\(-\gamma (g)/ \beta (g)\)reduces to\(\gamma _0/ (\beta _0\,g)\)to all orders of perturbation theory, with\(\gamma _0\)diagonal,\(\gamma (g) = \gamma _0 g^2+\cdots \)the anomalous-dimension matrix and\(\beta (g) = -\beta _0 g^3+\cdots \)the beta function. The construction is based on a novel geometric interpretation of operator mixing (Bochicchio in Eur Phys J C 81:749, 2021), under the assumption that the eigenvalues of the matrix\(\gamma _0/ \beta _0\)satisfy the nonresonant condition\(\lambda _i-\lambda _j\ne 2k\), with\(\lambda _i\)in nonincreasing order and\(k\in {\mathbb {N}}^+\). The nonresonant condition has been numerically verified up to\(i,j=10^4\)in Bochicchio et al. (Phys Rev D 108:054023, 2023). In the present paper we provide a number theoretic proof of the nonresonant condition for twist-2 operators essentially based on the classic result that Harmonic numbers are not integers. Our proof in YM theory can be extended with minor modifications to twist-2 operators in\(\mathcal {N}=1\)SUSY YM theory, large-NQCD with massless quarks and massless QCD-like theories.
Complex quantum information tasks in a gravitational background require multipartite entanglement for effective processing. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the properties of multipartite entanglement in a relativistic setting. In this paper, we study genuine N-partite entanglement of massless Dirac fields in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, characterized by the presence of a black hole event horizon (BEH) and a cosmological event horizon (CEH). We obtain the general analytical expression of genuine N-partite entanglement shared bynobservers near BEH andm(\(n+m=N\)) observers near CEH. It is shown that genuine N-partite entanglement monotonically decreases with the decrease of the mass of the black hole, suggesting that the Hawking effect of the black hole destroys quantum entanglement. It is interesting to note that genuine N-partite entanglement is a non-monotonic function of the cosmological constant, meaning that the Hawking effect of the expanding universe can enhance quantum entanglement. This result contrasts with multipartite entanglement in single-event horizon spacetime, offering a new perspective on the Hawking effect in multi-event horizon spacetime.
A sizable fraction of the heavy elements synthesized by stars in galaxies condenses into submicrometre-sized solid-state particles known as dust grains. Dust produces a wavelength-dependent attenuation,Aλ, of the galaxy emission, thereby substantially altering its observed properties. Locally,Aλis in general the sum of a power law and a ultraviolet feature (‘bump’) produced by small, carbon-based grains. However, scant information exists regarding its evolution across cosmic time. Here, leveraging data from 173 galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope in the redshift rangez= 2–12, we report the detection of the ultraviolet bump in az≈ 7.55 galaxy (when the Universe was only ~700 Myr old) and show that the power-law slope and the bump strength decrease towards high redshifts. We propose that the flatAλshape at early epochs is produced by large grains newly formed in supernova ejecta, which act as the main dust factories at such early epochs. Importantly, these grains have undergone minimal reprocessing in the interstellar medium due to the limited available cosmic time. This discovery offers crucial insights into the redshift-dependent evolution of dust attenuation properties, shedding light on the role of supernovae-driven dust production, grain size distribution at early cosmic times and the processes driving dust evolution at later epochs.
We derive a class of Taub-NUT metrics in the presence of a scalar field (TNS) by using Ernst equations and potential, as well as using Ehlers transformations on the exact solutions that was recently introduced in Azizallahi et al. Nucl Phys B and Mirza et al. (Eur Phys J C. Furthermore, we investigate the effective potential, geodesics, topological charge, quasinormal modes (QNMs) and the deflection angle of light in a gravitational lensing for the obtained class of TNS metrics. We also use conformal transformations to generate a new class of exact solutions of the Einstein-conformal-scalar theory by using the obtained TNS solutions as seed metrics. Finally we compare QNMs of the class of exact solutions.
The standard cosmological model, based on Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy (\(\varLambda \)CDM), faces several challenges. Among these is the need to adjust the scenario to account for the presence of vast voids in the large-scale structure of the universe, as well as the early formation of the first stars and galaxies. Additionally, the observed matter–antimatter asymmetry in the universe remains an unresolved issue. To address this latter question, Andrei Sakharov proposed a twin universe model in 1967. Building upon this idea and introducing interactions between these two universe sheets through a bimetric model, we propose an alternative interpretation of the large-scale structure of the universe, including its voids and the acceleration of cosmic expansion.
This Letter proposes a new signature for confining dark sectors at the LHC. Under the assumption of a QCD-like hidden sector, hadronic jets containing stable dark bound states originating from hidden strong dynamics, known as semi-visible jets, could manifest in proton-proton collisions. In the proposed simplified model, a heavy\(Z'\)mediator coupling to SM quarks allows the resonant production of dark quarks, subsequently hadronizing in stable and unstable dark bound states. The unstable dark bound states can then decay back to SM quarks via the same\(Z'\)portal or photons via a lighter pseudo-scalar portal (such as an axion-like particle). This mechanism creates a new signature where semi-visible jets are enriched in non-isolated photons. We show that these exotic jets evade the phase space probed by current LHC searches exploiting jets or photons due to the expected high jet neutral electromagnetic fraction and photons candidates non-isolation, respectively. In the proposed analysis strategy to tackle such signature, we exploit jets as final state objects to represent the underlying QCD-like hidden sector. We show that, by removing any selection on the neutral electromagnetic fraction from the jet identification criteria, higher signal efficiency can be reached. To enhance the signal-to-background discrimination, we train a deep neural network as a jet tagger that exploits differences in the substructure of signal and background jets. We estimate that with the available triggers for Run 2 and this new strategy, a high mass search can claim a\(5 \sigma \)discovery (exclusion) of the\(Z'\)boson with a mass up to 5 TeV (5 TeV) with the full Run 2 data of the LHC when the fraction of unstable dark hadrons decaying to photons pairs is around\({30}{\%}\), and with a coupling of the\(Z'\)to SM quarks of 0.25.
The origin of tiny neutrino mass is an unsolved puzzle leading to a variety of phenomenological aspects beyond the Standard Model (BSM). We considerU(1) gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM) where so-called seesaw mechanism is incarnated with the help of thee generations of Majorana type right-handed neutrinos followed by the breaking ofU(1) and electroweak gauge symmetries providing anomaly free structure. In this framework, a neutral BSM gauge boson\(Z^\prime \)is evolved. To explore the properties of its interactions we consider chiral (flavored) frameworks where\(Z^\prime \)interactions depend on the handedness (generations) of the fermions. In this paper we focus on\(Z^\prime \)-neutrino interactions which could be probed from cosmic explosions. We consider\(\nu \overline{\nu } \rightarrow e^+ e^-\)process which can energize gamma-ray burst (GRB221009A, so far the highest energy) through energy deposition. Hence estimating these rates we constrainU(1) gauge coupling\((g_X)\)and\(Z^\prime \)mass\((M_{Z^\prime })\)under Schwarzchild (Sc) and Hartle-Thorne (HT) scenarios. We also study\(\nu \)-DM scattering through\(Z^\prime \)to constrain\(g_X-M_{Z^\prime }\)plane using IceCube data considering high energy neutrinos from cosmic blazar (TXS0506+056), active galaxy (NGC1068), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the Lyman-\(\alpha \)data, respectively. Finally highlighting complementarity we compare our results with current and prospective bounds on\(g_X-M_{Z^\prime }\)plane from scattering, beam-dump and\(g-2\)experiments. [PICS code].
Aerosols in Jupiter’s stratosphere form intriguing polar hoods, which have been investigated by ultraviolet cameras on Cassini and the Hubble Space Telescope. Transient, concentrated dark ovals of unknown origin have been noted within both the northern and southern polar hoods. However, a systematic comparative study of their properties, which could elucidate the physical processes active at the poles, has not yet been performed due to infrequent observations. Using 26 global maps of Jupiter taken by Hubble between 1994 and 2022, we detected transient ultraviolet-dark ovals with a 48% to 53% frequency of occurrence in the south. We found the southern dark oval to be 4 to 6 times more common than its northern counterpart. The southern feature is an anticyclonic vortex and remains within the auroral oval during most of its lifetime. The oval’s darkness is consistent with a 20 to 50 times increase in haze abundance or an overall upward shift in the stratospheric haze distribution. The anticyclonic vorticity of the dark oval is enhanced relative to its surroundings, which represents a deep extension of the higher-altitude vortices previously reported in the thermosphere and upper stratosphere. The haze enhancement is probably driven by magnetospheric momentum exchange, with enhanced aerosols producing the localized heating detected in previous infrared retrievals.
We investigate the Chern–Simons-like formulation of exotic general massive gravity models within the framework of third-way to three-dimensional gravity. We classify our construction into two main approaches: one using torsional cosmological Einstein and exotic massive gravity equations, and the other a torsion-free approach. The former approach, while mathematically appealing, precludes the construction of critical exotic models where the central charges vanish. In contrast, the latter approach has a wider parameter space and allows for the construction of critical models. An explicit example of an exotic general model is provided to illustrate both methods. Our methodology represents the first step towards establishing the most general Chern–Simons-like formulation of third-way to three-dimensional gravity, which would enable the study of identifying its bulk/boundary unitary sector.
The precise origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain unknown. Multiwavelength observations of nearby FRB sources can provide important insights into the enigmatic FRB phenomenon. Here we present results from a sensitive, broadband X-ray and radio observational campaign of FRB 20200120E, the closest known extragalactic repeating FRB source (located 3.63 Mpc away in an ~10-Gyr-old globular cluster). We place deep limits on the persistent and prompt X-ray emission from FRB 20200120E, which we use to constrain possible origins for the source. We compare our results with various classes of X-ray sources, transients and FRB models. We find that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be associated with ultraluminous X-ray bursts, magnetar-like giant flares or an SGR 1935+2154-like intermediate flare. Although other types of bright magnetar-like intermediate flares and short X-ray bursts would have been detectable from FRB 20200120E during our observations, we cannot entirely rule them out as a class. We show that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be powered by an ultraluminous X-ray source or a young extragalactic pulsar embedded in a Crab-like nebula. We also provide new constraints on the compatibility of FRB 20200120E with accretion-based FRB models involving X-ray binaries. These results highlight the power of multiwavelength observations of nearby FRBs for discriminating between FRB models.
We study the implications of the observed excess in\(B^+ \rightarrow K^+ \nu \bar{\nu }\)under the assumption of Rank-One Flavour Violation, i.e. that New Physics couples to a single specific direction in flavour space. By varying this direction we perform analyses at the level of the low-energy EFT, the SMEFT, and with explicit mediators such as leptoquarks and colorless vectors (\(Z^\prime \)and\(V^\prime \)). We study correlations with other flavour, electroweak and collider observables, finding that the most interesting ones are with\(K \rightarrow \pi \nu \bar{\nu }\),\(B_s \rightarrow \mu ^+ \mu ^-\), meson mixing and the LHC searches in\(\tau ^+ \tau ^-\)high-energy tails. Among the various mediators, the scalar leptoquarks\(\tilde{R}_2\)and\(S_1\)offer the best fits of the Belle-II excess, while being consistent with the other bounds. On the other hand, colorless vectors are strongly constrained by meson mixing and resonance searches in\(p p \rightarrow \tau ^+ \tau ^-\). In all cases we find that a flavour alignment close to the third generation is generically preferred.
In an extension of MSSM with two triplets and a singlet, called the TNMSSM, there are seven neutralinos which can enrich the study of cold dark matter if one expects that the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is responsible for the observation of Planck satellite. Such a model, compared to the MSSM, can naturally offer a solution to the\(\mu \)problem, and its lightest neutralino, which is bino-like, can also provide a correct relic density by using the coannihilation mechanism due to the newly added triplinos. Taking into account the related experimental measurements, such as the bound on the SM-like Higgs mass, theBmeson rare decays, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon\(a_\mu \), the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measurements and the latest dark matter direct detection experiment LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), the TNMSSM parameter space can be strictly limited. In respect to all the constraints mentioned above, we find that a bino-like neutralino with a mass in the region\([100, 450]~\textrm{GeV}\)can successfully account for the correct dark matter relic density. Additionally, most of the viable parameter space can be tested in the near future experiments such as the Xenon-nT experiment or LHC.
In this paper, we continue previous work where one-brane spacetimes coupled to the\({\mathcal {N}}=2\)ungauged five dimensional hypermultiplets were found. We explore their symmetries as well as study their full geodesic structure. The one-branes are characterized by a coupling constant that distinguishes the behavior of the geodesics from smooth and causally connected in the positive case to singular and repulsive in the negative case.
We investigate Color Flavor Locked (CFL) Strange Stars using the most basic de Rham–Gabadadze–Tolley massive gravity model, which explains the massive graviton in the absence of a ghost propagating mode. In the current study, the compact star model has been achieved by solving the field equations for a static, uncharged sphere (Li et al., in Phys Dark Universe 42: 101308, 2023). Here, we provide some analytical and numerical findings and examine the effects of the massive gravity and anisotropy characteristics on the structure of this stellar object. The modified Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation is obtained by taking into account the hydrostatic equilibrium. In order to verify stability of the stellar object, we have taken into account the redshift function and adibatic index. Furthermore, it is observed that the model parameters have a substantial impact on the mass, radius, and compactness of the star object. Finally, our findings provide a possible structure of hypothetical super massive CFL strange stars, which may be placed in the lower “mass-gap” region\(2~M_{\odot }-5~M_{\odot }\)and remains stable without collapsing into a black hole corresponding to our considered model parameters.
The most recent searches by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in final states with soft leptons and missing transverse energy show mild excesses predominantly associated with dilepton invariant masses of about\(10{-}20\)GeV, which can result from decays of electroweakinos that are heavier than the lightest neutralino by\(\mathcal {O}(10)\)GeV. On the other hand, these analyses are insensitive to electroweakino mass splittings smaller than about 5 GeV. In previous work, we demonstrated that while recent searches in the monojet channel can exclude some of the smallest\(\mathcal {O}(1)\)GeV mass splitting configurations for electroweakinos, they also exhibit excesses that can overlap with the soft-lepton excesses in certain models, including a simplified scenario with pure higgsinos. In this work we dive deeper into these excesses, studying the analyses in detail and exploring an array of models that go beyond the simplified scenarios considered by the experimental collaborations. We show that, in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, the overlapping excesses are not unique to the pure-higgsino limit, instead persisting in realistic parameter space featuring a bino-like lightest supersymmetric particle with some wino admixture. On the other hand, for the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with a singlino-like lightest supersymmetric particle and higgsino-like next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle(s), the excess in the two-lepton channel fits rather well with the parameter space predicting the correct relic abundance through freeze out, but the monojet fit is much poorer. Interestingly, the excesses either do not overlap or do not exist at all for two non-supersymmetric models seemingly capable of producing the correct final states.
We perform a theoretical study on the spectrum of the low-lying hidden-bottom (\(q\bar{q}b\bar{b}\)with\(q=\)u,dands) and double-bottom (\(q\bar{q}bb\)) tetraquark states within a nonrelativistic quark model, in which the instanton-induced interaction is taken as the residual spin-dependent hyperfine interaction between quarks. All the model parameters are fixed by fitting the spectrum of the ground hadron states. The numerical results indicate that masses of several\(X_{q\bar{q}}\),\(Z_{b}\), and\(Z_{bs}\)tetraquark states are below and near thresholds of corresponding meson-meson channels, thus these states may form components of exotic meson states with reasonable probabilities. Especially, in present model, masses of several obtained states with quantum number\(I^G(J^P)=1^+(1^{+})\)are close to\(Z_b^\pm (10610)\), so one may expect these states to be non-negligible components of the experimentally observed\(Z_{b}\)states. Concerning to the double-bottom tetraquark states, the present results are in general consistent with other previous works. Two possible stable\(T_{bb}\)states with quark content\(bb\bar{n}\bar{n}\)(\(n=u\)ordquark) lying at energies 10558 MeV and 10650 MeV are found, and one possible stable\(bb\bar{n}\bar{s}\)state is found, whose energy is\(\sim 10687\)MeV.
In this work, we explore a Schwarzschild-like black hole within the framework of metric-affine bumblebee gravity. First, we investigate the behavior of the Kretschmann scalar and singularities in this modified gravity approach. Next, we introduce a newly defined time coordinate related to a stationary asymptotically flat spacetime. We also analyze the scattering effects and numerically calculate and comprehensively examine the partial and total absorption cross sections. At the high-frequency approximation, we find that the absorption cross section tends to the geodesic capture cross section. The continued fraction method is applied to investigate the quasinormal modes, and we explore the deviations of both the real and imaginary terms of the quasinormal modes from the Schwarzschild case in detail. We verify the relation between the shadow radius and the real part of the quasinormal frequencies at the eikonal limit within this modified gravity framework. Finally, we examine the energy emission rate.
We study the QCD topology and axion properties at finite temperature and chemical potential in the framework of the two-flavor Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model. We find that the behaviors of the two lowest cumulants of the QCD topological charge distribution and axion properties are highly sensitive to the critical behavior of the chiral phase transition. In particular, the topological susceptibility and the axion mass follow the response of the chiral condensate to temperature and chemical potential, showing that both quantities decrease monotonically with the increment of temperature and/or chemical potential. However, it is important to note that the normalized fourth cumulant behaves differently depending on the temperature. At low temperatures, it is a non-monotonic function of the chemical potential, while at high temperatures, it monotonically decreases. Additionally, its value invariably approaches the asymptotic value of\(b_2^{\text {inst}}=-1/12\), predicted by the dilute instanton gas model. We also observe that with the increase in chemical potential at relatively low temperatures, the axion self-coupling constant exhibits a sharp peak around the critical point, which can even be more than twice its vacuum value. After that, the self-coupling drops sharply to a much lower value than its vacuum value, eventually approaching zero in the high chemical potential limit. The finding that the axion self-coupling constant is significantly enhanced in high-density environments near the chiral phase transition could lead to the creation or enhancement of an axion Bose–Einstein condensate in compact astrophysical objects.
We study solutions of Einstein equations with negative cosmological constant in five dimensions that describe black holes whose event horizons are homogeneous, anisotropic spaces. We focus on the case where the constant-time slices of the horizon are the Nil geometry, the Thurston geometry associated to the Heisenberg group. For such spaces, we analyze the symmetries both in the asymptotic region and in the near horizon region. We compute the associated conserved charges, which turn out to be finite and admit a sensible physical interpretation. We analyze the thermodynamics of the Nil black hole, and we present a stationary spinning generalization of it in the slowly rotating approximation.
Vigneron  recently proposed a modification of general relativity in which a non-dynamical term related to the spatial topology is introduced in the Einstein equation. The original motivation for this theory is to allow for the non-relativistic limit to exist in any physical topology. In the present paper, we derive a first inhomogeneous exact vacuum solution of this theory for a spherical topology, assuming staticity and spherical symmetry. The metric represents a black hole and a repulsive singularity at opposite poles of a 3-sphere. The solution is similar to the Schwarzschild metric, but the spacelike infinity is cut, and replaced by a repulsive singularity at finite distance, implying that the spacelike hypersurfaces have finite volume, and the total mass is zero. We discuss how this solution paves the way to massive, non-static solutions of this theory, more directly relevant for cosmology.
The ionization energy loss distributions (spectra) of high-energy protons in oriented silicon crystals are considered on the basis of computer simulation. Evolution of the spectra with the change of the angle\(\theta \)between the particle momentum and the crystal (110) plane is investigated. It is shown that both the most probable and the average energy loss change non-monotonically with the increase of\(\theta \). While at small\(\theta \)these losses are lower than their values in a disoriented crystal, at larger\(\theta \)they can be higher than these values. The dependence of the most probable energy loss on\(\theta \)contains a discontinuity, which however might be challenging to register experimentally. Additionally, the influence of dechanneling and the incident beam divergence on the spectra of planar channeled protons is demonstrated.
The localSL(2N,C) symmetry is shown to provide, when appropriately constrained, a viable framework for a consistent unification of the known elementary forces, including gravity. Such a covariant constraint implies that an actual gauge field multiplet in theSL(2N,C) theory is ultimately determined by the associated tetrad fields which not only specify the geometric features of spacetime but also govern which local internal symmetries are permissible within it. As a consequence, upon the covariant removal of all “redundant” gauge field components, the entire theory only exhibits the effective\(SL(2,C)\times SU(N)\)symmetry, comprisingSL(2,C) gauge gravity on one hand andSU(N) grand unified theory on the other. Given that all states involved in theSL(2N,C) theories are additionally classified according to their spin values, many potentialSU(N) GUTs, including the conventionalSU(5) theory, appear to be irrelevant for standard spin 1/2 quarks and leptons. Meanwhile, applying theSL(2N,C) symmetry to the model of composite quarks and leptons with constituent chiral preons in its fundamental representations reveals, under certain natural conditions, that among all accompanying\(SU(N)_{L}\times SU(N)_{R}\)chiral symmetries of preons and their composites only the\(SU(8)_{L}\times SU(8)_{R}\)meets the anomaly matching condition ensuring masslessness of these composites at large distances. This, in turn, identifiesSL(16,C) with the effective\(SL(2,C)\times SU(8)\)symmetry, accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most likely candidate for hyperunification of the existing elementary forces.
We study zero and finite temperature static Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stars in the combined Rastall-Rainbow (RR) theory of gravity by considering different BEC equation of states (EoSs). We obtain the global properties of BEC stars by solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations of RR gravity with values of Rastall parameter\(\kappa \)and Rainbow function\(\Sigma \)chosen accordingly. We observe that the parameter\(\kappa \)has negligible effect on the maximum mass of the stars considered, whereas\(\Sigma \)alters it significantly, and increasing the value of\(\kappa \)beyond a certain limit results in unstable solutions for any value of\(\Sigma \). We report that the inclusion of temperature in our analysis expands the parameter space by including more values of\(\kappa \). However, temperature has negligible effect on the maximum mass of the stellar profiles in all the three theories. We have also studied the compactness and stability of the obtained stellar equilibria. We report that BEC stars satisfy various energy conditions within the range of\(\kappa \)and\(\Sigma \)taken in our paper.  Further, we find that the maximum masses and radii of the stars within RR theory can have good agreement with the observational data on pulsars for all the EoSs considered and in particular, the Colpi-Wasserman-Shapiro EoS, which was ruled out in General Relativity (GR).  We also find that, in contrast to the results of GR, BEC stars consistent with observations can be realised in the RR theory with smaller bosonic self-interaction strength.
In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal Kähler potential. Following previous studies that revealed that this model can overcome the\(\eta \)-problem found in F-term models, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties, the energy scales of both inflation and string formation influence the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by these cosmic strings.
We construct a new stellar compact object model in the regime of anisotropic pressure using the framework of gravitational decoupling via minimal geometric deformation, with the particularity that the seed solution used is the known Kohler–Chao–Tikekar cosmological solution. As an extra condition to close the Einstein’s field equations resulting for this construction, we use a generalised complexity factor for self-gravitating spheres to the well-known Wyman IIa solution. The resulting model fulfils the fundamental physical acceptability stellar conditions for a compactness factor of a pulsar SMC X-1. The stability of the model is also investigated.
Anisotropic hydrodynamics (aHydro) has proven successful in modeling the evolution of quark-gluon matter created in heavy-ion collisions. The hydrodynamic description of quark-gluon plasma has also been widely used to study sound phenomena, such as shock waves. It has recently been shown that initial fluctuations in energy density and supersonic partons can generate fairly strong shock waves. However, significant anisotropic properties of the system due to the rapid longitudinal expansion of matter have not been taken into account in such studies. Moreover, the process of isotropization and its characteristic time-scales were not considered along with the question of the shock waves formation. Previous studies on shock discontinuous solutions in anisotropic hydrodynamics assumed constant anisotropy, leading to flow refraction towards the anisotropy axis and flow acceleration, characteristics of rarefaction waves, indicating limitations in this approach. This paper investigates discontinuous solutions for normal shock waves without flow refraction, introducing two compression parameters for longitudinal and transverse pressures. The resulting analytical solutions, as well as numerical computations, provide an isotropization mechanism of the system.
In this research paper, we focus on analyzing the electromagnetic fields within the framework of a traversable wormhole that incorporates a cosmic string. We then extend our investigation to a traversable wormhole with a global monopole charge, addressing the same problem in this new context. To facilitate our study, we compute the electromagnetic field tensor and derive Maxwell’s vacuum field equations, which govern the behavior of the electric and magnetic fields. Using an analytical approach, we obtain solutions for the electromagnetic fields and compare them with the results from conventional Minkowski flat space. Our study demonstrates significant deviations in the electromagnetic fields, and thus, changes the behavior of electromagnetic waves in the presence of a cosmic string and a global monopole charges within this wormhole background.
We present a novel simulation of a strongly interacting dark sector also known as the Hidden Valley scenarios using angular ordered showers and the cluster hadronisation model in Herwig 7. We discuss the basics of this implementation and the scale hierarchies underpinning the simulation. With the help of a few benchmarks, we show the effect of variation of dark sector parameters on thrust and angularities within the dark sector, and study correlation functions, which can be helpful for understanding the angular structure of these events. Finally we comment on the uncertainties introduced due to lack of knowledge of hadronisation parameters within the dark sectors.
Teleparallel description of gravity theories where the gravity is mediated through the tetrad field and consequent torsion provide an alternative route to explain the late time cosmic speed up issue. Generalisation  of the teleparallel gravity theory with different functional forms of the torsion scalarTleads tof(T) gravity. The role of scalar field played in addressing issues in cosmology and astrophysics has developed an interest in the inclusion of a scalar field along with an interaction potential in the action. Such a generalised gravity theory is dubbed as\(f(T,\phi )\)theory. We have explored such a gravity theory to reconstruct the interaction potential of the scalar field required for an extended matter bounce scenario. The cosmological implications of the reconstructed scalar field potential are studied considering two viable and well known functional forms of\(f(T,\phi )\). The energy conditions of these model are discussed to assess the viability of the cosmological models.
We introduce a novel Einstein–Rosen BTZ wormhole metric as a solution to the Einstein field equations with a negative cosmological constant and explore in detail its various phenomenological aspects. We show that the wormhole metric is characterized by a horizon at the throat, resembling a black hole horizon. This implies that our wormhole metric describes a one-way traversable wormhole at the throat, with Hawking radiation observed by an observer located at some distance from the wormhole. It is also found the same Hawking temperature using the BTZ-like coordinates and Kruskal-like coordinates. This temperature is invariant not only on the type of coordinates but also the nature of the spin of quantum fields. Importantly, we find that at the wormhole throat, the spacetime is not a pure vacuum solution, but rather contains an exotic string matter source with negative tension, which may stabilize the wormhole geometry. To this end, we found that the size of the wormhole throat is proportional to the number of quantum bits suggesting a possible implications on ER=EPR. Further we studied the particle dynamics and, finally, we tested the ANEC with a test scalar and vector fields. For the double null-component computed in BTZ coordinates, we found an apparent divergence at the wormhole throat, which is then shown to be regularized by means of Kruskal-like coordinates. The ANEC for such a scalar/vector field is violated at the wormhole throat.
The aim of this paper is to explore the thermodynamic topology of topological charged dilatonic black holes. To achieve this, our study will begin by examining the characteristics of topological charged black holes in dilaton gravity. Specifically, we will concentrate on the impact of the topological constant on the event horizon of these black holes. Subsequently, we will analyze these black holes, considering their thermodynamic and conserved quantities, in order to assess the validity of the first law of thermodynamics. We explore the thermodynamic topology of these black holes by treating them as thermodynamic defects. For our study, we examine two types of thermodynamic ensembles: the fixedqensemble and the fixed\(\phi \)ensemble. To study the impact of the topological constant (k) on thermodynamic topology, we consider all possible types of curvature hypersurfaces that can form in these black holes. By calculating the topological charges at the defects within their thermodynamic spaces, we analyze both the local and global topology of these black holes. We also investigate how the parameters of dilaton gravity affect the thermodynamic topology of black holes and highlight the differences compared to charged black holes in the General Relativity.
A shear-free, collapsing compact object, described by an embedding class I solution and emitting radiation, is presented here. Because of the properties of embedding class I, this four-dimensional interior spacetime can be embedded in pseudo-flat five-dimensional space. Starting with an initially static and shear-free gravitating body through the Karmarkar condition, we have explored the time evolution of the system using the time-dependent Einstein field equations. The interior solution is smoothly matched with the Vaidya outgoing solution across a time-like hypersurface which yields the temporal behaviour of the model. Further, a thorough physical analysis of the thermodynamic variables has been presented spatially and temporally. As the time progresses into the future, the surface compactness factor approaches the Buchdahl limit until it crosses this to proceed with the collapse. Before\(2m_\Sigma /r_\Sigma \rightarrow 8/9\), the equation of state adjusts itself like a self-immune system to hold the system by increasing\(\Gamma _{rc}\)(i.e. increasing stiffness). All the physical quantities, e.g., density, pressure anisotropy, radiation, luminosity, temperature, are non-singular throughout the interior of the star at a finite time slice. As the time progresses, these quantities point towards a future singularity. Throughout the evolution, the surface density and surface pressure always remain lower than their corresponding central values. Similarly, the causal temperature also always remains higher than the non-causal counterpart throughout the interior as well as during the evolution.
AbstractThe paper summarizes the main provisions of Alexander Spirin’s concept on the possible role of RNA, molecular machines, and molecular colonies in the emergence of life, including (1) the role of the capability of polyribonucleotides of spontaneous rearrangements and recombinations in the generation of RNA molecules and development of their structure, as well as in the early replication of RNA; (2) the principle of operation of molecular machines powered by the energy of Brownian motion and the need for their emergence to solve the problem of unwinding double-stranded molecules formed as a result of the complementary copying of RNA; (3) the role of molecular colonies formed during the replication of RNA in porous media as a mode of compartmentalization and as a prerequisite for the evolution in the precellular RNA world.
Abstract—The paper examines two habitable zones with different physical conditions on exoplanets: planets with liquid water on the surface and conditions close to Earth’s (“Goldilocks Zone”), and cold worlds with icy surfaces and subsurface oceans (“Snow Maiden Zone”). The mechanisms of exchange of matter and energy between subglacial oceans and the surrounding space are discussed. It is noted that the biospheres of icy worlds with internal oceans are better protected from unfavorable external cosmic conditions. Subglacial biospheres are weakly dependent on the radiation intensity and flare activity of their parent stars, and the number of planets in the Universe with the physical conditions of the icy Snow Maiden Zone significantly exceeds the number of planets in the very limited Goldilocks Zone. It can be assumed that it is the biospheres of icy oceanic worlds that are much more widespread in the Universe compared to terrestrial-type biospheres.
Abstract—According to data obtained by theUlyssesspacecraft in 2017, high-latitude current sheets have been discovered in the polar heliosphere. They have been observed during solar activity minima in 1994 and 2007 at a distance of 2–3 AU above the south pole of the Sun. The discovered current sheets formed a conical surface rotating as a whole around the Sun’s rotation axis with the Carrington period. In this study, a semianalytical MHD model of conical current sheets is developed. The internal structure of heliospheric region bounded by these sheets—a magnetic funnel with reduced solar wind speed and the plasma beta—has been studied. Solutions corresponding to different intersections of the funnel by theUlyssesspacecraft have been obtained under different conditions near the Sun. The conditions under which the dimensions of the funnel agree with observations are clarified. For the first time, situations are treated in which the plasma and magnetic field parameters inside the funnel vary quasi-periodically in space. The study of the magnetic funnel structure challenges new issues for solar physics, whose solutions will enable a better understanding of the physical conditions on the early Earth and the features of the primary biosphere formation.
Abstract—Analysis of meteorites and terrestrial rocks using modern bacterial paleontology methods leads to the conclusion that Life did not originate on Earth, but originated in the form of a protogenome during the formation of the Solar System. Micron and submicron organisms have existed since the origin of the Solar System to the Phanerozoic and into the Phanerozoic on Earth. The study of this organic world can seriously change the understanding of the general development of the living world and the patterns of its evolution, as well as our understanding of the volume of minerals associated with the Precambrian.
AbstractComputer modeling has shown that, during the collisional evolution of a solid-state component in gas–dust protoplanetary disks, porous dust clusters of widely ranging sizes are formed. Clusters of this kind have a well-developed internal structure that is topologically similar to the structure of porous catalysts, adsorbents, and carriers used in the organic synthesis technology. On the other hand, observational data currently obtained by such instruments as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) show that complex preorganic compounds rather than only water and volatiles are present in protoplanetary disks. This suggests the possibility that, in protoplanetary disks, there are mechanisms of capturing complex chemical compounds by porous dust clusters and transporting these compounds to warmer regions during migration. When getting to warmer regions of protoplanetary disks, dust clusters undergo a change in the pore space, which may increase the surface holding the captured compounds and, hence, intensify their reactivity.
We consider gedanken experiments to destroy Kerr black holes, by means of absorbing matter with sufficient energy and angular momentum. It is shown that extremal and near-extremal Kerr black holes cannot be destroyed in a process that includes a second order contribution to its final mass, and matter sources satisfy the null energy condition. Such contribution is calculated using hypersurface integration on the event horizon, and it traces similarities with terms related to matter-black hole interactions and a rotational self-energy lower bound suggested in previous works.
AbstractThe study of microorganism tolerance to extreme influences is an integral part of astrobiology. Despite the large number of works in this field, the limits of maintaining viability and activity remain uncertain, and they are probably much wider than the currently known boundaries, especially taking into account the adaptive capabilities of microorganisms. In the vast majority of astrobiological experiments, a very limited set of organisms and the impact of a small number of factors are studied. It seems natural that research gradually develops from modeling simple systems (pure cultures and single-factor impacts) to more complex ones, closer to hypothetical extraterrestrial ecosystems. Nevertheless, studies of the most complex systems (microbial communities under the complex action of extraterrestrial conditions in laboratory and space experiments) are still extremely few in number. At the same time, some features of multifactor impacts and the response of complex microbial systems to such impacts are often given little attention. This paper attempts to summarize some data on the tolerance of microorganisms to extreme factors of extraterrestrial space, as well as to outline a number of insufficiently studied promising fields of astrobiological research.
Abstract—The Drake formula or equation represents the best known way of introducing the question of the distribution of life and intelligence in the Universe into the framework of quantitative science. A generalization of the Drake equation is presented in the form of a partial differential equation that includes the effects of the transfer of life elements from one exoplanetary system to another. Possible implications of this equation for assessing the prospects for detecting life beyond Earth are discussed.
This research delves into the potential existence of traversable wormholes (WHs) within the framework of modified, curvature based gravity. The modification includes linear perturbations of the matter Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor with specific coupling strengths\(\alpha \)and\(\beta \)and can thus be viewed as a special case of linearf(R,T)-gravity with a variable matter coupling or as the simplest additively separable\(f(R,{\mathcal {L}}_m,T)\)-model. A thorough examination of static WH solutions is undertaken using a constant redshift function; therefore, our work can be regarded as the first-order approximation of WH theories in\(f(R,{\mathcal {L}}_m,T)\). The analysis involves deriving WH shape functions based on non-commutative geometry, with a particular focus on Gaussian and Lorentzian matter distributions\(\rho \). Constraints on the coupling parameters are developed so that the shape function satisfies both the flaring-out and asymptotic flatness conditions. Moreover, for positive coupling parameters, violating the null energy condition (NEC) at the WH throat\(r_0\)demands the presence of exotic matter. For negative couplings, however, we find that exotic matter can be avoided by establishing the upper bound\(\beta +\alpha /2<-\frac{1}{\rho r_0^2}-8\pi \). Additionally, the effects of gravitational lensing are explored, revealing the repulsive force of our modified gravity for large negative couplings. Lastly, the stability of the derived WH solutions is verified using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) formalism.
We formulate a new class of modified gravity models, that is, generalized four-dimensional Chern–Pontryagin models, whose action is characterized by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalarRand the Chern–Pontryagin topological term\( ^*RR\), i.e.,\(f(R, ^*RR)\). Within this framework, we derive the gravitational field equations and solve them for the particular models,\(f(R, ^*RR)=R+\beta ( ^*RR)^2\)and\(f(R, ^*RR)=R+\alpha R^2+\beta ( ^*RR)^2\), considering two ansatzes: the slowly rotating Schwarzschild metric and first-order perturbations of Gödel-type metrics. For the former, we find a first-order correction to the frame-dragging effect boosted by the parameterL, which characterizes the departures from general relativity results. For the latter, Gödel-type metrics hold unperturbed, for specific sort of perturbed metric functions. We conclude this paper by displaying that generalized four-dimensional Chern–Pontryagin models admit a scalar-tensor representation, whose explicit form presents two scalar fields:\(\Phi \), a dynamical degree of freedom, while the second,\(\vartheta \), a non-dynamical degree of freedom. In particular, the scalar field\(\vartheta \)emerges coupled with the Chern–Pontryagin topological term\( ^*RR\), i.e.,\(\vartheta ^*RR\), which is nothing more than Chern–Simons term.
AbstractThis paper gives a review of the latest observational data on early stellar nucleosynthesis in the Universe compiled on the basis of an invited report at the “Astronomical Problems of the Origin and Development of Life. The Young Sun and the Earth” meeting-discussion dedicated to the memory of Academician M.Ya. Marov, March 19, 2024. The article presents modern observational results and theoretical ideas about the origin of chemical elements such as carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, which are important for the synthesis of organic matter.
Abstract—The concept of the origin of life outside the Earth is currently one of the dominant directions of theoretical, experimental and observational scientific research. The problem of the origin of life is interdisciplinary and includes the most pressing issues of astronomy, biology, paleontology, organic chemistry and other sciences. This issue of the journal is devoted to the astronomical aspects of the origin and development of life.
Abstract—The Russian space project with the automatic lunar station (ALS)Luna-28is designed to deliver samples of lunar polar regolith to Earth. It is known that the regolith in the vicinity of the lunar poles may contain several percent by weight of water ice and other volatile compounds of cosmic origin. A significant portion of the lunar water could have been delivered to the Moon by comets. It is known that cometary water contains organic compounds, some of which have a complex prebiological structure. Similar comets collided with the Earth in the distant past and also delivered organic compounds of cosmic origin to our planet. According to the panspermia hypothesis, such compounds in the Earth’s primordial ocean could have initiated the process of the emergence of initial forms of primitive life. On the Moon, similar cometary organic matter may be preserved in pristine form in polar permafrost. Studying samples of the polar material delivered in theLuna-28ALS return capsule in terrestrial laboratories will allow experimental verification of the presence or absence of extraterrestrial life spores in it.
AbstractThe optical properties of the atmosphere limit the capabilities of ground-based astronomy. Taking telescopes beyond the atmosphere has allowed not only to significantly expand the spectral range of observations, but also to achieve great success in measurements in the visible range. In part, this has stimulated the creation of adaptive optical systems for ground-based telescopes. Of particular interest in the study of planets and exoplanets are observations in the IR and submm ranges. The capabilities of ground-based observations in these ranges are expanding, but will always remain limited. Extra-atmospheric astronomy has absolute priority in this. The article provides an overview of extra-atmospheric observatories in the UV, visible and IR ranges. Particular attention is paid to the new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
Abstract—A review of the results on the migration of celestial bodies in the Solar System and in some exoplanetary systems is presented. Some problems of planet accumulation and migration of planetesimals, small bodies and dust in the forming and present Solar System are considered. It has been noted that the outer layers of the Earth and Venus could have accumulated similar planetesimals from different areas of the feeding zone of the terrestrial planets. In addition to the theory of coaccretion and the mega-impact and multi-impact models, the formation of the embryos of the Earth and the Moon from a common rarefied condensation with subsequent growth of the main mass of the embryo of the Moon near the Earth is also discussed. Along with the Nice model and the “grand tack” model, a model is considered in which the embryos of Uranus and Neptune increased the semimajor axes of their orbits from values of no more than 10 AU to present values only due to gravitational interactions with planetesimals (without the motions of Jupiter and Saturn entering into resonance). The influence of changes in the semimajor axis of Jupiter’s orbit on the formation of the asteroid belt is discussed, as well as the influence of planetesimals from the feeding zone of the giant planets on the formation of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. The migration of bodies to the terrestrial planets from different distances from the Sun is considered. It is noted that bodies from the feeding zone of the giant planets and from the outer asteroid belt could deliver to the Earth a quantity of water comparable to the mass of water in the Earth’s oceans. The migration of bodies ejected from the Earth is considered. It is noted that about 20% of the ejected bodies that left the Earth’s sphere of influence eventually fell back to the Earth. The probabilities of collisions of dust particles with the Earth are usually an order of magnitude greater than the probabilities of collisions of their parent bodies with the Earth. The migration of planetesimals is considered in exoplanetary systems Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST-1. The amount of water delivered to the inner planet Proxima Centauri b, may have been more than the amount delivered to the Earth. The outer layers of neighboring planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system may contain similar material if there were many planetesimals near their orbits during the late stages of planetary accumulation.
Abstract—The article is devoted to the significantly underestimated contribution of radiation from the young Sun to the formation of physical conditions on the early Earth. A new view on the faint young Sun paradox is presented: the main role in solving the paradox is given to the impact of the increased activity of the young Sun on the Earth’s atmosphere. The role of planetary organic films is considered as a climate-forming factor involved in resolving the faint young Sun paradox. The spectrum of radiation of the young Sun and the paradox of the discrepancy between the chlorophyll absorption spectrum and the spectrum of solar radiation are discussed, and also indicated a possible connection between the faint young Sun paradox and the origin and evolution of photosynthesis on Earth.
In current studies for testing Bell inequalities at colliders, the reconstruction of spin correlations from scattering cross-sections relies on the bilinear form of the spin correlations, but not all local hidden variable models (LHVMs) have such a property. To demonstrate that a general LHVM cannot be rule out via scattering cross-section data, we propose a specific LHVM, which can exactly duplicate the same scattering cross-section for particle production and decay as the standard quantum theory, making it indistinguishable at colliders in principle. Despite of this, we find that reconstructing spin correlations through scattering cross-sections can still exclude a broad class of LHVMs, e.g., those models employing classical spin correlations as a surrogate for quantum spin correlations.
In this paper, we use the solution phase space approach based on the covariant phase space formalism to compute the conserved charges of the BTZ black hole, namely mass, angular momentum, and entropy. Furthermore, we discuss the first law of the BTZ black hole and the Smarr relation. For completeness, outer horizon and inner horizon cases have been all included. Additionally, the results of the three-dimensional Kerr-dS spacetime have also been obtained. Our results are consistent with previous investigations. Considering the simplicity of the circumstances, we have presented the most detailed possible information, with the aim of facilitating rsearch in related fields.
The branching ratios of the flavor changing top quark decays in the SM are too small to be detected experimentally. Therefore, any observable signal for these processes at the LHC would serve as compelling evidence for new physics. In the flavor-dependent\(U(1)_X\)model, a newly introduced Higgs singlet interacts directly with the quark sector and mixes with the SM-like Higgs, influencing the\(t\rightarrow ch\)and\(t\rightarrow uh\)process. Additionally, the flavor dependence of the\(U(1)_X\)charge affect the\(t\rightarrow cZ\)process. In this work, we investigate these process within the framework of the flavor-dependent\(U(1)_X\)model. Numerical results indicates that with suitable choices of new physics parameters, the branching ratios of these processes in the flavor-dependent\(U(1)_X\)model can be significantly enhanced. Specifically, the branching ratios of\(t\rightarrow ch\)and\(t\rightarrow uh\)can reach the order of\(10^{-4}\)in some chosen parameter spaces, which is close to the current experimental upper limit. This suggests that these processes have significant opportunities to be observed experimentally, and the parameter space of the model will face constraints from the experimental upper bounds.
We study the hot medium effects in high-multiplicity proton–proton (pp) collisions at\(\sqrt{s_{NN}}=13\)TeV via the charmonium probes. The hot medium is described with the hydrodynamic model, while charmonium evolutions in the medium are studied with a time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The hot medium dissociation on charmonium is considered with the temperature-dependent complex potential parametrized with the results from lattice QCD calculations. The ratio\(\sigma _{\psi (2S)}/\sigma _{J/\psi }\)of\(J/\psi \)and\(\psi (2S)\)production cross sections are calculated and compared with the LHCb experimental data in pp collisions. Our calculations explain the charmonium relative suppression in different transverse momentum and multiplicity bins. The suppression of this ratio is mainly affected by the effects of the deconfined medium. It is less affected by the initial effects before the generation of the heavy quark pair. We suggest this to be a clear signal of the small QGP droplets generated in high multiplicity pp collisions.
Matching conditions are universal ingredients that describe how fragmentation functions change when heavy-flavour thresholds are crossed during the factorisation scale evolution. They are the last missing piece for a consistent description of observables with identified final-state hadrons at next-to-next-to leading order accuracy in quantum chromodynamics. We present an analytical form of the matching condition for light-flavour to hadron fragmentation function at next-to-next-to leading order. The derivation is performed by extending the formalism employed in the extraction of the next-to leading order matching conditions to the subsequent order, making use of\(e^+e^-\)annihilation cross sections. We obtain the first non-trivial heavy-quark effect in the light-quark fragmentation functions and provide results in Mellin space.
Recently, J. Harada proposed a theory relating gravity to the Cotton tensor, dubbed as “Cotton gravity” (CG). This is an extension of General Relativity such that every solution of the latter turns out to be a solution of the former (but the converse is not true) and, furthermore, it is possible to derive the cosmological constant as an integration constant within it. In this work we investigate CG by coupling it to both non-linear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields. We study static and spherically symmetric solutions implementing a bouncing behaviour in the radial function so as to avoid the development of singularities, inspired by the Simpson–Visser black bounce and the Bardeen model, both interpreted as magnetic monopoles. We identify the NLED Lagrangian density and the scalar field potential generating such solutions, and investigate the corresponding gravitational configurations in terms of horizons, behaviour of the metric functions, and regularity of the Kretchsman curvature scalar. Our analysis extends the class of non-singular geometries found in the literature and paves the ground for further analysis of black holes in CG.
We consider the non-commutative (NC) Kerr black hole where the mass of the central object is smeared over a region of linear size\(\sqrt{b}\),bis the strength of the NC character of spacetime. For the spacetime under consideration, we calculate the amplification factor for electromagnetic and gravitational fields and study various properties of a thin accretion disk. The expression for the amplification factor is obtained with the help of the asymptotic matching technique. The amplification factor is then plotted against frequency for various values of the spinaand the NC parameterb. Though the amplification factor increases withabut decreases withb, the cut-off frequency up to which we have amplification increases withaandb. We then study the effect of the spin and the NC nature of spacetime on the energy flux, temperature distribution, emission spectrum, energy conversion efficiency, and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit of a thin accretion disk around the black hole with the help of the steady-state Novikov–Thorne model. Our study reveals that these quantities increase with the spin and the NC parameter. We also find that the disk around the NC Kerr black is hotter and more luminous than that around the Kerr black hole and the NC Schwarzschild black hole. We can conclusively infer from our investigation that the NC nature of spacetime has a significant impact on the superradiance phenomenon as well as on various properties of thin accretion disks.
The focus of this work is centered on determining whether traversable wormholes admitting Einasto density profile exist within the framework off(R,T) gravity. Using the Morris–Thorne spacetime, we express the wormhole configuration and formulate the anisotropic gravitational equations for a particular linear modified model. Afterwards, by considering two different (constant and variable) redshift functions, we derive the shape function for wormholes and examine its potential stability. The developed functions conform to the necessary conditions and form a connection between two spacetime regions that are asymptotically flat. We also examine the viability of resulting wormhole solutions by verifying their violation with the null energy conditions. We also investigate the active gravitational mass and the complexity factor for our solutions. The later quantity is found to be negative near the wormhole throat and becomes zero when moving away from this point. Further, various methods of stability analysis are utilized to assess the developed models. Our results suggest that the constructed wormhole geometries meet the necessary conditions, thereby existing within the considered modified gravity.
The paper studies the possible interplay between matter and geometry in scalar tensor theories of gravitation where the energy–momentum tensor is directly coupled with the Einstein tensor. After obtaining the scalar tensor representation of the\(f(R, G_{\mu \nu }T^{\mu \nu })\)gravity, the analysis continue with an approach based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes in open systems. To this regard, various thermodynamic properties are directly obtained in this manner, like the matter creation (annihilation) rate and the corresponding creation (annihilation) pressure. In the case of the Roberson–Walker metric several analytic and numerical solutions are found in the asymptotic regime. In the last part of the manuscript a specific parametrization for the Hubble rate is constrained using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms in the case of cosmic chronometers (CC) and BAO observations, obtaining an approximate numerical solution which can describe the cosmological model. For this model, we have obtained by fine-tuning some numerical solutions which exhibit creation mechanisms in different specific regimes.
In this work we study the thermodynamics formulation for unimodular gravity under the election of two different models for the energy diffusion function. Such function encodes the current for the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor and is usually termed asQ(t). In analogy to the cosmological scenario where the cosmic expansion is influenced byQ(t), the thermodynamics implications in this scheme are also determined by the choice of the functionQ(t), as we discuss in the work. Specifically, we consider the barotropic and the continuous spontaneous localization models as energy diffusion functions, commonly used in the literature as viable candidates to face the well-known\(H_{0}\)tension. The consistency conditions demanded for the entropy of the system in terms of the cosmological parameters of the model: positive production (\(dS/dt>0\)) and convexity condition (\(d^{2}S/dt^{2} <0\)), are investigated. We show that these conditions strongly constraint the viability of both models. Additionally, we comment about our results and compare with those obtained in recent works where the restriction of the parameters for these two diffusion models was implemented with the use of cosmological data.
Jupiter’s oxygen content is inextricably tied to its formation history and the evolution of the early Solar System. Recent one-dimensional thermochemical modelling of CO showed that the planet’s bulk water content could be subsolar, in stark contrast to the water enrichment determined near the equator using the Juno spacecraft. Here we use a hydrodynamic model to study Jupiter’s atmospheric dynamics at and below the water cloud level with simplified thermochemistry to show the effect of hydrodynamics on the abundance of disequilibrium species CO, PH3and GeH4in the troposphere. If PH3and GeH4provide only an upper limit for the oxygen abundance (≤5 times solar), our results suggest an oxygen enrichment range of 2.5–5 times solar using updated CO thermochemistry. Using the conventional CO chemical timescale, we further reveal a correlation between moist convection and the CO abundance at the water cloud level. If such a correlation is found observationally, it would favour the formation of Jupiter near the snow line, which harbours a supersolar oxygen abundance.
The Monumentexperiment measures ordinary muon capture (OMC) on isotopes relevant for neutrinoless double-beta (\(0\nu \beta \beta \)) decay and nuclear astrophysics. OMC is a particularly attractive tool for improving the theoretical description of\(0\nu \beta \beta \)decay. It involves similar momentum transfers and allows testing the virtual transitions involved in\(0\nu \beta \beta \)decay against experimental data. During the 2021 campaign, Monumentstudied OMC on\(^{76}\)Se and\(^{136}\)Ba, the isotopes relevant for next-generation\(0\nu \beta \beta \)decay searches, like Legendand nEXO. The experimental setup has been designed to accurately extract the total and partial muon capture rates, which requires precise reconstruction of energies and time-dependent intensities of the OMC-related\(\gamma \)rays. The setup also includes a veto counter system to allow selecting a clean sample of OMC events. This work provides a detailed description of the Monumentsetup operated during the 2021 campaign, its two DAQ systems, calibration and analysis approaches, and summarises the achieved detector performance. Future improvements are also discussed.
We investigate electrical charge transport in hot magnetized plasma using first-principles quantum field theoretical methods. By employing Kubo’s linear response theory, we express the electrical conductivity tensor in terms of the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation. Utilizing leading-order results for the damping rates from a recent study within a gauge theory, we derive the transverse and longitudinal conductivities for a strongly magnetized plasma. The analytical expressions reveal drastically different mechanisms that explain the high anisotropy of charge transport in a magnetized plasma. Specifically, the transverse conductivity is suppressed, while the longitudinal conductivity is enhanced by a strong magnetic field. As in the case of zero magnetic field, longitudinal conduction is determined by the probability of charge carriers to remain in their quantum states without damping. In contrast, transverse conduction critically relies on quantum transitions between Landau levels, effectively lifting charge trapping in localized Landau orbits. We examine the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the transverse and longitudinal electrical conductivities over a wide range of parameters and investigate the effects of a nonzero chemical potential. Additionally, we extend our analysis to strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma and study the impact of the coupling constant on the anisotropy of electrical charge transport.
In this paper, our aim is to extend our earlier work [Ahmed et al. in Eur. Phys. J. C 76:280, 2016], investigating an axisymmetric plasma flow with angular momentum onto a spherical black hole. To accomplish that goal, we focus on the case in which the ideal magnetohydrodynamic approximation is valid, utilizing certain conservation laws which arise from particular symmetries of the system. After formulating a Hamiltonian of the physical system, we solve the Hamilton equations and look for critical solutions of (both in and out) flows. Reflecting the difference from the Schwarzschild spacetime, the positions of sonic points (fast magnetosonic point, slow magnetosonic point, Alfvén point) are altered. We explore several kinds of flows including critical, non-critical, global, magnetically arrested and shock induced. Lastly, we analyze the shock states near a specific quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole and determine that quantum effects do not favor shock states by pushing the shock location outward.
In this paper, we study black hole solutions in double field theory. In the first part, we introduce a solution-generating method and classify black hole solutions into three categories in standard double field theory. To solve the problem of double time, we utilize space/time split double field theory in the second part to derive black hole solutions. By introducing a cosmological constant and imposing the strong constraint, our findings indicate that when considering the entire doubled spacetime, the curvature signifies a generalized AdS vacuum. However, in the subspace of the entire spacetime, black holes and curvature singularities emerge.
According to the quantum deformation approach to quantum gravity, the thermodynamical entropy of a quantum-deformed (q-deformed) black hole with horizon areaAestablished by Jalalzadeh is expressed as\(S = \pi \sin \left( \frac{A}{8G\mathcal {N}} \right) /\sin \left( \frac{\pi }{2\mathcal {N}}\right) \), where\(\mathcal {N}=L_q^2/L_{p}^2\)is the q-deformation parameter,\(L_{p}\)denotes the Planck length, and\(L_q\)denotes the quantum-deformed cosmic apparent horizon distance. In this paper, assuming that the q-deformed entropy is associated with the apparent horizon of the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) universe, we derive the modified Friedmann equation from the unified first law of thermodynamics,\( dE = TdS + WdV \). And this one obtained is in line with the modified Friedmann equation derived from the law of emergence proposed by Padmanabhan. It clearly shows the connection between the law of emergence and thermodynamics. We further investigate the constraints of entropy maximization in the framework of the q-deformed horizon entropy, and the results demonstrate the consistency of the law of emergence with the maximization of the q-deformed horizon entropy.
We report the performance of a magnetically silent optically pumped cesium magnetometer with a statistical sensitivity of 3.5 pT/\(\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}\)at 1 Hz and a stability of 90 fT over 150 s of measurement. Optical pumping with coherent, linearly-polarized, resonant light leads to a relatively long-lived polarized ground state of the cesium vapour contained in a measurement cell. The state precesses at its Larmor frequency in the magnetic field to be measured. Nonlinear magneto-optical rotation then leads to the rotation of the plane of polarization of a linearly polarized probe laser beam. The rotation angle is modulated at twice the Larmor frequency. A measurement of this frequency constitutes an absolute measurement of the magnetic field magnitude. Featuring purely optical operation, non-magnetic construction, low noise floor, and high stability, this sensor will be used for the upcoming TUCAN electric dipole moment experiment and other highly sensitive magnetic applications. Novel aspects of the system include commercial construction and the ability to operate up to 24 sensors on a single probe laser diode.
The null energy condition (NEC) is a fundamental principle in general relativity, and its violation could leave discernible signatures in gravitational waves (GWs). A violation of the NEC during the primordial era would imprint a blue-tilted spectrum on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nanohertz frequencies, potentially accounting for the recently detected signal by pulsar timing arrays. Remarkably, models of NEC violation during inflation also predict a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum in the millihertz frequency range, which could be detectable by upcoming space-based GW detectors such as Taiji. The observation of this distinctive spectrum would provide compelling evidence for new physics beyond the standard cosmological paradigm. In this study, we explore Taiji’s ability to detect an SGWB arising from NEC violation during inflation, considering various foregrounds and noise sources, including an extragalactic foreground from binary black hole mergers throughout the Universe, a galactic foreground from white dwarf binaries, and the intrinsic noise of the Taiji detector. Employing comprehensive Bayesian parameter estimation techniques to analyze simulated Taiji data, we demonstrate a remarkable improvement in precision of three orders of magnitude compared to the NANOGrav 15-year data set for measuring the tensor power spectrum amplitude,\(P_{T,2}\), during the second inflationary stage. This substantial enhancement in measurement capabilities underscores Taiji’s potential as a powerful probe for investigating the NEC violation in the early Universe.
We revisit planar vortex solutions within a model derived from the dimensional reduction of scalar electromagnetism, with a quartic potential incorporating the Carroll–Field–Jackiw term. We explore analytically and numerically the influence of a Lorentz symmetry-breaking constant field on these configurations and our analysis shows how this constant field can produce a new asymptotic behaviour characterised by damped oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields on the edge of the vortices.
In a simplified model including an exotic vector-likeX-quark (VLQ-X) with electric charge 5/3, we investigate the process\(e^{+}p \rightarrow \bar{\nu }_{e}X+\bar{\nu }_{e}X\bar{t}\)induced by the couplings between the VLQ-Xand the first- and third-generation quarks at the futureepcolliders. We further explore the prospects of discovering the VLQ-Xvia the\(X\rightarrow tW\)decay model at the electron–hadron Future Circular Collider (FCC-eh) with its proposed 60 GeV electron beam and 50 TeV proton beam. We focus our analysis on the final states, including two same-sign lepton (electrons or muons) or\(\mu \mu \)pairs, at least oneb-tagged jet, and large missing transverse momentum. By performing a detailed signal-to-background analysis and detector simulations, the 95% confidence level exclusion limits and\(5\sigma \)discovery reaches are presented in terms of parameter space regions.
We investigate the radiative efficiency and jet power in the spacetime of a rotating black hole within the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG), which includes an additional LQG parameter. The results show that as the LQG parameter increases, the radiative efficiency decreases for slowly rotating black holes while it increases for rapidly rotating black holes. Furthermore, the jet power is found to increase for different black hole spins. With the observed data from the well-known sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, GRS1124-683, GRO J1655-40, and GRS1915+105, we make some constraints on the black hole spin parameter and the LQG parameter. The presence of the LQG parameter broadens the allowed range of the black hole spin parameter for sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564 and GRO J1655-40. However, for the source GRS 1915+105, there is no overlap between the allowed parameter regions, which implies that the rotating LQG black hole cannot simultaneously account for the observed jet power and the radiative efficiency as in other black hole spacetimes
Recent measurements of the Lamb shift of muonic helium-4 ions were used to infer the alpha particle charge radius. The value found is compatible with the radius extracted from the analysis of the electron-helium scattering. Thus, the new spectroscopic data put additional empirical bounds on some free parameters of certain physics theories beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we analyze the new data in the context of large extra-dimensional theories. Specifically, we calculate the influence of the radion, the scalar degree of freedom of the higher-dimensional gravity, on the energy difference between the 2S and 2P levels of this exotic atom. The radion field is related to fluctuations of the volume of the supplementary space. It should be treated as a phenomenologically independent quantity in relation to the tensorial degrees of freedom of the metric within the braneworld scenario. Based on the spectroscopic data of muonic helium, we find constraints for the effective energy scale of the radion as a function of the alpha particle radius. Then, we discuss the implications of these new constraints on the proton radius puzzle. We also establish a new empirical bound for the radion by examining its influence on the isotopic shift in the 2P-2S transition of muonic hydrogen and muonic deuteron. In connection with this discussion, we study the impact of the radion on the tension observed in measurements of the difference between the squared radii of the helion and alpha particle as extracted from muonic and electronic helium isotopes.
A study of the dynamical and thermodynamical stability of a charged thin-shell wormhole built by gluing two Reissner–Nordström geometries is presented. The charge on the shell is linearly related to the matter content. For the dynamical stability, a concise inequality is obtained, valid for any barotropic equation of state that relates the pressure with the energy density at the throat. A thermodynamical description of the system is introduced, which leads to the temperature and the electric potentials. Adopting a linear equation of state for the pressure and a definite form for the entropy function, the set of equilibrium configurations that are both dynamically and thermodynamically stable is found.
Significant enhancements of J/\(\psi \)production have been observed by various experiments at RHIC and LHC for very low transverse momenta in peripheral heavy-ion collisions, which has ignited a surge of investigations into photon-induced processes in hadronic heavy-ion collisions (HHICs). Within this wave of research enthusiasm, the search for more photon induced products in HHICs becomes paramount. In this paper, we perform the calculation of the\(\rho \)and\(\phi \)production resulting from photon-nucleus interactions in HHICs, which are crucial probes for studying the properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in HHICs. Our study reveals that, in comparison to hadronic production, the photon-induced production of\(\rho \)and\(\phi \)does not reach the same level of significance as that observed in J/\(\psi \)production. Nevertheless, it remains substantial, especially in peripheral collisions, holding great promise for experimental verification in the imminent future.
During the cosmic evolution process, as the temperature of a cosmological boson gas falls below a certain threshold, a Bose–Einstein condensation process can occur at various points throughout the cosmic history of the Universe. In this model, dark matter, conceptualized as a non-relativistic, Newtonian gravitational condensate is governed by the Gross–Pitaevskii–Poisson system. In our present study, we investigate the Bose–Einstein condensation process of bosonic DM by treating it as an approximate first-order phase transition within a modified cosmological framework, known as Tsallis cosmology. We examine the evolution of relevant physical quantities characterizing the evolution dynamics of the Universe, including energy density, temperature, redshift, scale factor, Hubble parameter, and dimensionless deceleration parameter before, during, and following the Bose–Einstein condensation phase transition takes place. Additionally, we especially investigate the specific era of the evolution of the Universe characterized by a mixture ofnormaland condensate phases of dark matter. We analyze the behavior of temporal evolution of an important time-dependent parameter, called the condensate dark matter fraction throughout the condensation process and find the time duration of condensation of dark matter in the Tsallis cosmological model. We see that the presence of Bose–Einstein condensate dark matter in the framework of Tsallis-modified cosmology significantly alters the cosmological evolution of the Universe as compared to the standard model of cosmology. We also find for a typical value of Tsallis non-extensive parameter\(\beta =0.35\), the model could explain an accelerated Universe without invoking any additional energy component and solve the age problem of our Universe.
Since the weak cosmic censorship conjecture was proposed, research on this conjecture has been ongoing. This paper explores the conjecture in black holes that are closer to those existing in the real universe (i.e., rotating black holes enveloped by dark matter). In this paper, we obtained a first-order corrected analytical solution for the black hole event horizon through an approximate solution. The validity of the first-order corrected analytical solution will be provided in the appendix. We conduct our study by introducing a test particle and a scalar field into the black hole. Our conclusions show that, in extremal case, both a test particle and a scalar field can disrupt the event horizon of the Kerr-like black hole; in near-extremal case, both a test particle and a scalar field can disrupt the event horizon of the Kerr-like black hole. When cold dark matter is not considered, the conclusion is consistent with previous research.
While searching at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for the production and decay of the CP-odd scalar (\(A^0\)) in the 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) with Natural Flavour Conservation (NFC) via the channels\(gg\rightarrow A^0\)(through one-loop triangle diagrams) and\(A^0\rightarrow h^0 Z^*\)(with\(m_{h^0} =125\)GeV or\(m_{h^0} < 125\)GeV, withZoff-shell), respectively, a factorisation of the two processes is normally performed, with the\(A^0\)state being on-shell. While this approach is gauge-invariant, it is not capturing the presence of either of the following two channels:\(gg\rightarrow Z^*\rightarrow h^0Z^*\)(through one-loop triangle diagrams) or\(gg\rightarrow h^0Z^*\)(through one-loop box diagrams). As the resolution of the\(A^0\)mass cannot be infinitely precise, we affirm that all such contributions should be computed simultaneously, whichever the\(h^0\)(\(Z^{*}\)) decay(splitting) products, thereby including all possible interferences amongst themselves. The cross section of the ensuing complete process is significantly different from that obtained in the factorisation case, being of the order up to ten percent in either direction at the integrated level and larger (including changes in the shape of kinematical observables) at the differential level. We thus suggest that the complete calculation ought to be performed while searching for\(A^0\)in this channel. We illustrate this need for the case of a 2HDM of Type-I in the inverted hierarchy scenario with\(m_{h^0}<125\)GeV.
We consider a scenario with axions/axion-like particles Chern–Simons gravity coupling, such that gravitational waves can be produced directly from axion wave parametric resonance in the early universe after inflation. This axion gravity term is less constrained compared to the well-searched axion photon coupling and can provide a direct and efficient production channel for gravitational waves. Such stochastic gravitational waves can be detected by either space/ground-based gravitational wave detectors or pulsar timing arrays for a broad range of axion masses and decay constants.
This paper investigates the Joule-Thomson expansion for a five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet Anti-de Sitter black hole. Firstly, by taking Van der Waals gas as an example, we induce the definition of the Joule-Thomson coefficient and the inversion phenomena. One can give theT–Pgraph and the inversion curves. Then, we obtain the thermodynamic properties of the Gauss-Bonnet black hole and use the same way to get theT–Pfigure, which shows differences from Van der Waals gas and other black holes. To our surprise, we can’t observe its inversion phenomena. Due to this reason, we further studied the vanished inversion region and found that the electric charge plays an important role in this phenomenon. We analogy black hole charged and neutral, which get some interesting consequences. Finally, we make Legendre transition to Smarr relation and investigate whether the electric potential has the same result as the electric charge’s landscape. These results will uncover the inner interaction between the enthalpy and the electric charge during the Joule-Thomson process.
Quantum clock synchronization (QCS) can measure out the high-precision clock difference among distant users, which breaks through the standard quantum limit by employing the properties of quantum entanglement. Currently, the wavelength division multiplexed QCS network has been demonstrated with a spontaneous parametric down-conversion entangled photon source. In this paper, we propose a more efficient QCS network scheme with the wavelength multicasting entangled photon source, which can decrease at least 25% of wavelength channel consumption under the identical network scale. Afterwards, a four node QCS network is demonstrated, where the wavelength multicasting entangled photon source is utilized with dual-pumped four-wave mixing silicon chip. The experimental results show that the measured time deviation is 3.4 ps with an average time of 640 s via the multiple fiber links of more than 10 km.
Water activity recorded in asteroids offers a perspective on their habitability. Aqueous alteration, namely the interaction of liquid water with minerals, occurred in the parent body of the C-type asteroid Ryugu. However, Ryugu is not a wet body, and the processes that led to the loss of liquid water along with its chemical environment remain unclear. We report the presence of sodium carbonates, chlorides and sulfates in Ryugu samples, which indicate that alkaline, salt-rich water once flowed through its parent body. Highly concentrated brine probably formed through evaporation or freezing of the liquid water in the final stages of aqueous alteration. Similar processes may have occurred in carbonaceous asteroids in the Solar System, although terrestrial weathering of meteorites might obscure evidence of salt precipitation. Sodium salts could be crucial for comparing the evolved water in carbonaceous bodies and alkaline subsurface oceans in the dwarf planet Ceres and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
\(\varLambda \)-Cold Dark Matter (\(\varLambda \)CDM) has been successful at explaining the large-scale structures in the universe but faces severe issues on smaller scales when compared to observations. Introducing self-interactions between dark matter particles claims to provide a solution to the small-scale issues in the\(\varLambda \)CDM simulations while being consistent with the observations at large scales. The existence of the energy region in which these self-interactions between dark matter particles come close to saturating the S-wave unitarity bound can result in the formation of dark matter bound states called darkonium. In this scenario, all the low energy scattering properties are determined by a single parameter, the inverse scattering length\(\gamma \). In this work, we set bounds on\(\gamma \)by studying the impact of darkonium on the observations at direct detection experiments using data from CRESST-III and XENON1T. The exclusion limits on\(\gamma \)are then subsequently converted to exclusion limits on the self-interaction cross-section and compared with the constraints from astrophysics and N-body simulations.
In this study, we investigate the image of a rotating compact object (CO) illuminated by a geometrically thin, optically thin disk on the equatorial plane. As the radius of the CO’s surface fluctuates, the CO may partially or entirely obscure the photon region. We observe that the perceived photon ring may exhibit discontinuities, deviating from a closed structure, and may even disappear entirely. We find that the disruption and disappearance of the photon ring are dependent on the observational angle-a novel phenomenon not previously observed in black hole imaging studies. Our study reveals that while the factors influencing this unique photon ring phenomenon are diverse and the outcomes complex, we can provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of the physical essence and variation trends of this phenomenon. We do this by introducing and analyzing the properties and interrelationships of three characteristic functions,\(\tilde{\eta }\),\(\eta _o\), and\(\eta _s\)related to the photon impact parameters. Additionally, our analysis of the intensity cuts and inner shadows of the images uncovers patterns that differ significantly from the shadow curve.
We obtained the metric of the Schwarzschild-like black hole with loop quantum gravity (LQG) corrections in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time, under the assumption that the cosmological constant is decoupled in LQG. We investigated its thermodynamics, including the equation of state, criticality, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy. The\(P-v\)graph was plotted, and the critical behavior was calculated. It was found that, due to the LQG effect, the quantum-corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole exhibits a critical point and a critical ratio of 7/18, which differs from the Reissner–Nordstr\(\ddot{\textrm{o}}\)m-AdS black hole’s ratio of 3/8 (the same as that of the Van der Waals system) slightly. However, there are still some similarities compared to the Van der Waals system, such as the same critical exponents and a similar\(P-v\)graph. Moreover, it is concluded that the energy-momentum tensor related to the black hole’s mass could violate the conventional first law of thermodynamics. This modified first law may violate the conservation of Gibbs free energy during the small black hole-large black hole phase transitions, potentially indicating the occurrence of the zeroth-order phase transition. The Joule–Thomson expansion was also studied. Interestingly, compared to the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, the LQG effect leads to inversion points. The inversion curve divides the\(\left( P,T\right) \)coordinate system into two regions: a heating region and a cooling region, as shown in detail by the inversion curves and isenthalpic curves. The results indicated that there is a minimum inversion mass, below which any black hole will not possess an inversion point.
We perform a detailed phenomenological study of high-energy neutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS) focused on LHC far-forward experiments such as FASER\(\nu \)and SND@LHC. To this aim, we parametrise the neutrino fluxes reaching these LHC far-forward experiments in terms of ‘neutrino PDFs’ encoding their energy and rapidity dependence by means of theLHAPDFframework. We integrate these neutrino PDFs in the recently developedPOWHEG-BOX-RESimplementation of neutrino-induced DIS to produce predictions accurate at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the QCD coupling matched to parton showers (PS) withPythia8. We present NLO+PS predictions for final-state distributions within the acceptance for FASER\(\nu \)and SND@LHC as well as for two experiments of the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF), FASER\(\nu \)2 and FLArE. We quantify the impact of NLO QCD corrections, of the parton showering and hadronisation settings inPythia8, of the QED shower, and of the incoming neutrino flavour for the description of these observables, and compare our predictions with theGENIEneutrino event generator. Our work demonstrates the relevance of modern higher-order event generators to achieve the key scientific targets of the LHC neutrino experiments.
In this paper, we investigate the spacetime containing both small-scale structures (wiggles) and spatial dislocation, forming a wiggly cosmic dislocation. We study the combined effects of these features on the dynamics of massive and massless particles. Our results show that while wiggles alone lead to bound states and dislocation introduces angular momentum corrections, their coupling produces more complex effects, influencing both particle motion and wave propagation. Notably, this coupling significantly modifies radial solutions and eigenvalues, with the direction of motion or propagation becoming a critical factor in determining the outcomes. Numerical solutions reveal detailed aspects of particle dynamics as functions of dislocation and string parameters, including plots of trajectories, probability densities, and energy levels. These findings deepen our understanding of how a wiggly cosmic dislocation shapes particle dynamics, suggesting new directions for theoretical exploration in cosmological models.
We show for the first time that rotating wormholes are capable of emitting a Poynting flux in the process of accreting magnetized matter. To this end, we analyze the Damour–Solodukhin metric describing a Kerr-type wormhole and calculate the electromagnetic flux assuming a specific geometry for the magnetic field contained by the wormhole ergosphere. We find that for highly rotating wormholes a mechanism similar to that of Blandford and Znajek is possible, and the emitted electromagnetic flux is of the same order as for a Kerr black hole.
We analyze the extraction of the rotational energy of a Kerr black hole (BH) endowed with a test charge and surrounded by an external test magnetic field and ionized low-density matter. For a magnetic field parallel to the BH spin, electrons move outward(inward) and protons inward(outward) in a region around the BH poles(equator). For zero charge, the polar region comprises spherical polar angles\(-60^\circ \lesssim \theta \lesssim 60^\circ \)and the equatorial region\(60^\circ \lesssim \theta \lesssim 120^\circ \). The polar region shrinks for positive charge, and the equatorial region enlarges. For an isotropic particle density, we argue the BH could experience acyclicbehavior: starting from a zero charge, it accretes more polar protons than equatorial electrons, gaining net positive charge, energy and angular momentum. Then, the shrinking(enlarging) of the polar(equatorial) region makes it accrete more equatorial electrons than polar protons, gaining net negative charge, energy, and angular momentum. In this phase, the BH rotational energy is extracted. The extraction process continues until the new enlargement of the polar region reverses the situation, and the cycle repeats. We show that this electrodynamical process produces a relatively limited increase of the BH irreducible mass compared to gravitational mechanisms like the Penrose process, hence being a more efficient and promising mechanism for extracting the BH rotational energy.
The effect of Hawking radiation on tripartite measurement uncertainty in a Schwarzschild black hole background is analyzed in this study. Two scenarios are examined. In the first, quantum memory particles approach a Schwarzschild black hole and are positioned near the event horizon, while the particle being measured remains in the asymptotically flat region. In the second scenario, the measured particle moves toward the black hole, and the quantum memories stay in the asymptotically flat region. This study considers two initial quantum states, namely GHZ and W states. Our findings reveal that in both cases, measurement uncertainty increases steadily with rising Hawking temperature. When comparing the GHZ and W states, the GHZ state initially exhibits lower measurement uncertainty at low Hawking temperatures than the W state, indicating greater resilience to Hawking radiation. Additionally, when the quantum memories remain in the asymptotically flat region while the measured particle falls toward the black hole, the uncertainties for GHZ and W states do not align at high temperatures. The GHZ state consistently demonstrates lower measurement uncertainty, showcasing its superior robustness against Hawking radiation.
Quantum gravity has been baffling the theoretical physicist for decades now, both for its mathematical obscurity and phenomenological testing. Nevertheless, the new era of precision cosmology presents a promising avenue to test the effects of quantum gravity. In this study, we consider a bottom-up approach. Without resorting to any candidate quantum gravity, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) directly into the cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe sourced by a phantom scalar field with potential to study the evolution of the universe in a very early epoch. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our qualitative analysis shows that the introduction of GUP significantly alters the existence of fixed points for the potential considered in this paper. In addition, we confirm the existence of an inflationary phase and analyze the behavior of relevant cosmological parameters with respect to the strength of the GUP distortion.
A connection between regular black holes and horizonless ultracompact objects was proposed in Carballo-Rubio et al. (JHEP 08:046, 2023,arXiv:2211.05817[gr-qc]). In this paper, we construct a model of a horizonless compact object, specifically an anisotropic gravastar with continuous pressure, that corresponds to regular black hole spacetime in the appropriate limit. The construction begins by modeling an equation of state that satisfies the anisotropic gravastar conditions and transitions to the de Sitter (\(p=-\epsilon \)) upon horizon formation. The spacetime structure is similar to theQuantum Horizonless Compact Object(QHCO) described in Chen and Yokokura (Phys Rev D 109:104058, 2024,arXiv:2403.09388[gr-qc]). Within this model, we also generate images of the corresponding objects surrounded by a thin accretion disk. The resulting images reveal that assuming that the emitting matter exists only outside the object, the inner light ring structure closely resembles that of the horizonless configuration of a regular black hole and the QHCO, yet it exhibits a distinct light ring structure compared to the thin-shell gravastar model. However, the opposite occurs when emitting matter is taken into account inside the object.
The focus of this paper is to investigate the behavior of a codimension-one thick brane in the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity structure\(f(Q, {\mathcal {T}})\), whereQis the nonmetricity scalar and\({\mathcal {T}}\)is the trace of the energy–momentum tensor. Additionally, we examine whether braneworld scenarios are stable under small tensor perturbations and identify the associated massive and resonant modes. Our results indicate that the parameters controlling the modifications to the gravitational model-specifically those affecting nonmetricity and the energy–momentum tensor-significantly influence both the location and existence of these modes.
This work is devoted to exploring the formation and stability of thin-shell wormholes developed through the two similar copies of black holes bounded by the pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo. It is found that the horizon radius of a black hole decreases in the appearance of a pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo. The primary goal of the work is to investigate the stable composition of such wormholes using the analysis of linearized radial perturbation. It is worth mentioning that the existence of a pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo reduces the violation of energy bounds for the developed thin-shell wormholes. We investigate the impact of variable equations of state, such as barotropic, variable Chaplygin, and phantom-like equations of state, on the stability of the wormholes. The inquiry highlights that the appearance of a pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo portrays remarkable importance in preserving the stable compositions of thin-shell wormholes. The wormholes show maximal stable conduct for the selection of pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo as compared to already published research charged as well as regular thin-shell wormholes. The results reveal light on the interplay between wormholes and pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo, which increases our understanding of both conjectures and their potential implications for further space travel.
It is proved that charged thin shells (charged Dyson shells) can be supported in unstablestaticequilibrium states around spherically symmetric central compact objects. The regime of existence of the composed central-compact-object-static-charged-shell configurations is characterized by the inequalities\(\sqrt{m(m+2M)}<|q|<M+\sqrt{M^2+m^2}\), where\(\{m,q\}\)are respectively the proper mass and the electric charge of the supported shell andMis the mass of the central compact object (a black hole or an horizonless compact star). We reveal the physically interesting fact that the supported charged shells become marginally-stable in the\(|q|/\sqrt{m(m+2M)}\rightarrow 1^+\)limit, in which case the lifetime (instability timescale) of the composed system can be made arbitrarily large. Our analysis goes beyond the test shell approximation by properly taking into account the exact gravitational and electromagnetic self-interaction energies of the spherically symmetric shell in the curved spacetime. In particular, the existence of the composed compact-object-charged-shell static configurations in the Einstein–Maxwell theory is attributed to the non-linear electromagnetic self-energy of the supported shell.
We apply Wald’s formalism to a Lagrangian within generalised Proca gravity that admits a Schwarzschild black hole with a non-trivial vector field. The resulting entropy differs from that of the same black hole in General Relativity by a logarithmic correction modulated by the only independent charge of the vector field. We find conditions on this charge to guarantee that the entropy is a non-decreasing function of the black hole area, as is the case in GR. If this requirement is extended to black hole mergers, we find that for Planck scale black holes, a non-decreasing entropy is possible only if the area of the final black hole is several times larger than the initial total area of the merger. Finally, we discuss some implications of the vector Galileon entropy from the point of view of entropic gravity.
We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order,\(M_\textrm{PBH}\sim \mathcal{O}(M_{\odot })\), by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be\(\Delta N_{\textrm{Total}}\sim \mathcal{O}(60)\)and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between\(0.88\leqslant c_{s}\leqslant 1\), allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within\(10^{-3}\leqslant A \leqslant 10^{-2}\), indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small,\(M_{\textrm{PBH}}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot }\), and the large,\(M_{\textrm{PBH}}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot }\), mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.
Extrapolating the Standard Model Higgs potential at high energies, we study the barrier between the electroweak and Planck scale minima. The barrier arises by taking the central values of the relevant experimental inputs, that is the strong coupling constant and the top quark and Higgs masses. We then extend the Standard Model by including a non-minimal coupling to gravity, and explore the phenomenology of the Higgs inflation model. We point out that even configurations that would be metastable in the Standard Model, become viable for inflation if the non-minimal coupling is large enough to flatten the Higgs potential at field values below the barrier; we find that the required value of the non-minimal coupling is smaller than the one needed for the conventional Higgs inflation scenario (which relies on a stable Standard Model Higgs potential, without any barrier); in addition, values of the top mass which are larger than those required in the conventional scenario are allowed.
We present an extension to thePythiaMonte Carlo event generator that enables simulations of collisions between a generic hadron beam on a nuclear target with energy variation in event-by-event basis. This builds uponPythia’s module for heavy ions,Angantyr, as well as previous work on simulating hadron-proton collisions. As such, the extensions in this work are largely technical, except for a rudimentary model for hadronic fluctuations. With hadron-ion simulations, we implement an explicit vector-meson dominance (VMD) model that can be used to simulate interactions of hadronic component of real photons in photo-nuclear collisions. Such processes can be studied in ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions and in the future also with the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider. Our work also has applications to hadronic showers, e.g. air showers initiated by high-energy cosmic rays. We first validate the VMD model by comparing to HERA photoproduction data on proton target. Then we apply this to generate events for ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and present the results corresponding to the event-selection criteria matching to a recent ATLAS analysis. We find that single-particle multiplicity and rapidity distributions are well in line with the measured ones. We also construct the Fourier coefficients from two-particle correlations for the simulated events and study whether the resulting azimuthal anisotropies are consistent with the ATLAS results.
Classical electromagnetic radiation from moving point charges is foundational, but the thermal dynamics responsible for classical acceleration temperature are poorly understood. We investigate the thermal properties of classical electromagnetic radiation in the context of the correspondence between accelerated electrons and moving mirrors, focusing on three trajectories with asymptotically infinite (Davies–Fulling), asymptotically zero (Walker–Davies), and eternally uniform acceleration. The latter two are argued not to be thermal, while the former is found to emit thermal photons with a temperature that depends on the electron’s speed. Thermal radiation occurs in the absence of jerk.
The configuration of a perfect fluid distribution in an electric field under the influence of higher curvature geometric effects introduced through the Gauss–Bonnet invariants is studied in the 4 dimensional Glavan–Lin gravity formulation. It is found that whereas a constant spatially directed gravitational potential gives isothermal behaviour in the standard theory, this is not the case when extra curvature is present in general. A physically viable stellar model is constructed by assuming the Finch–Skea potential. The geometry and electrodynamics are well behaved being regular throughout the distribution including the centre. The model passes stability tests such as the Chandrasekar adiabatic stability criterion and causality. Additionally all energy conditions are satisfied within the star. We compare the performance of the model with its Einstein counterpart and observe that the higher curvature exerts a notable influence on all the physical properties of the star.
Highly forbidden\(\beta \)decays provide a sensitive test to nuclear models in a regime  in which the decay goes through high spin-multipole states, similar to the neutrinoless double-\(\beta \)decay process. There are only 3 nuclei (50V,113Cd,115In) which undergo a\(4^\textrm{th}\)forbidden non-unique\(\beta \)decay. In this work, we compare the experimental113Cd spectrum to theoretical spectral shapes in the framework of the spectrum-shape method. We measured with high precision, with the lowest energy threshold and the best energy resolution ever, the\(\beta \)spectrum of113Cd embedded in a 0.43 kg\(\hbox {CdWO}_4\)crystal, operated over 26 days as a bolometer at low temperature in the Canfranc underground laboratory (Spain). We performed a Bayesian fit of the experimental data to three nuclear models (IBFM-2, MQPM and NSM) allowing the reconstruction of the spectral shape as well as the half-life. The fit has two free parameters, one of which is the effective weak axial-vector coupling constant,\(g_A^{\text {eff}}\), which resulted in\(g_A^{\text {eff}}\)between 1.0 and 1.2, compatible with a possible quenching. Based on the fit, we measured the half-life of the113Cd\(\beta \)decay including systematic uncertainties as\(7.73^{+0.60}_{-0.57} \times 10^{15}\)yr, in agreement with the previous experiments. These results represent a significant step towards a better understanding of low-energy nuclear processes.
An asteroid’s interior dictates how its space environment changes its shape and surface, which provides a record of the collisional and dynamical evolution of the Solar System. Knowledge of asteroid interiors also enables the formulation of mitigation strategies against hazardous asteroids. Despite this importance, asteroid interiors remain poorly understood. Asteroids between 0.2 km and 10 km in diameter are thought to have rubble-pile interiors, transitioning to fractured interiors at 10 km scales, then to coherent and differentiated interiors at ≳100 km scales. The asteroid 433 Eros, the only 10-km-scale asteroid explored by a rendezvous mission, is an exemplar of asteroids at intermediate scales. Recent exploration of smaller rubble piles has provided insight into physical properties that are shared with Eros-sized objects. Here we quantify the seismic and physical properties of Eros’ interior through measurements and modelling of crater degradation and erasure from the impact that formed the 7.5-km-diameter Shoemaker crater on Eros. Our results indicate that Eros’ deep interior has a seismic wave scattering length of 0.5 ± 0.1 km and effective quality factorEQ<\({63}_{-13}^{+18}\)at frequencies >0.06 Hz. Contrary to the established view of Eros as a fractured shard, our findings suggest that Eros’ interior properties are consistent with those of a rubble-pile asteroid.
We propose that the thermodynamics and the kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole enclosed by a cavity can be studied in terms of the free energy landscape formalism. The generalized free energy for the black hole enclosed by a cavity in the canonical ensemble is derived by using the York’s approach, where the temperature on the cavity and the charges inside the cavity are kept as the fixed parameters. By quantifying the corresponding free energy landscape, we obtain the phase diagrams for the black hole in cavity, which reveal a Hawking–Page type transition for the uncharged black hole and a Van der Waals type transition for the charged black hole. We further assume that the dynamics of black hole state switching is mutually determined by the gradient force and the stochastic force arising from the free energy landscape and the thermal noises respectively. We then derive a recurrence relation for then-momentum of the first passage time distribution function, which enables the calculation of the kinetic times characterized by the mean first passage time and its relative fluctuation. Our analysis illustrates that the kinetics of black hole state switching is determined by the ensemble temperature and the barrier height on the free energy landscape.
Black hole (BH) mergers are natural sources of gravitational waves (GWs) and are possibly associated with electromagnetic events. Such events from a charged rotating BH with an accretion on to it could be more energetic and ultra-short-lived if the magnetic force dominates the accretion process because the attraction of ionized fluid with a strong magnetic field around the rotating BH further amplifies the acceleration of the charged particle via a gyromagnetic effect. Thus a stronger magnetic field and gravitational pull will provide an inward force to any fluid displaced in the radial direction and move it toward the axis of rotation with an increasing velocity. After many twists during rotation and the existence of restoring agents, Such events could produce a narrow intense jet starts in the form of Poynting flux along the axis of rotation resembling the Blandford–Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We investigated a charged rotating BH and obtained characteristic results (e.g., the remnant mass, magnetic field strength, luminosity, opening angle, viewing angle, and variation of viewing angle on the SGRB luminosity detection) that have a nice coincidence with rare events having GW associated with EM counterparts. This study gives a new insight into events with a strongly magnetized disk dominating the accretion process of energy extraction.
Recently, the LHCb Collaboration  provided updated measurements for the lepton flavour ratios\(R_K\)and\(R_{K^*}\). The currently observed values align with the predictions of the standard model. In light of these recent updates, our investigation delves into the repercussions of new physics characterized by universal couplings to electrons and muons. We specifically focus on their impact on various observables within the\(B\rightarrow K_2^*(1430)(\rightarrow K\pi )\mu ^+ \mu ^-\)decay. These observables include the differential branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry (\(A_{FB}\)), longitudinal polarization asymmetry (\(F_L\)), and a set of optimized observables (\(P_i\)). Our findings indicate that the branching ratio of\(B\rightarrow K_2^*(\rightarrow K\pi )\mu ^+ \mu ^-\)decay can be suppressed up to\(25\%\)for various new physics solutions. Furthermore, all permissible new physics scenarios demonstrate finite enhancement in the muon forward-backward asymmetry\((A_{FB})\)as well as an increase in the value of the optimized angular observable\(P_2\). Moreover, in the presence of new physics zero crossing points for\(A_{FB}\)and\(P_2\)shift towards higher\(q^2\). The current data have a mild deviation from SM predictions in\(P_5'\)observable in the low-\(q^2\)bin. We also explored massive\(Z'\)models, which can generate universal 1D new physics scenarios, characterized by\(C_9^{NP}<0\),\(C_9^{NP}=-C_{10}^{NP}\), and\(C_9^{NP}=-C_9'\). Using additional constraints coming from\(B_s-\overline{B_s}\)mixing and neutrino trident process, we find that the conclusions of the model-independent analysis remain valid.
We consider a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime having a space of positive curvature and study the cosmic evolution of dynamical vacuum energy. We utilize the dynamical system technique to study the existence of fixed points and their corresponding stability in model. The corresponding cosmological solutions describe late-time accelerating universe having decelerating era composed of radiation and matter-dominated phase. The numerical integration of autonomous system reveals that the cosmological solutions of dynamical vacuum energy model may describe the cosmic history of universe. As a consequence of the dynamical vacuum energy in closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model, the trajectories between fixed points in the phase space would also correspond to the bouncing and turnaround universe evolution.
The relationship between galaxies and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is an area of active research. One way to investigate this relationship is to compare parsec-scale jets formed by SMBHs to the projected shape of their kiloparsec-scale host galaxies. Here we analyse very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) images of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and optical images of their host galaxies by comparing the inner-jet position angle in VLBI-detected radio sources with the optical shapes of galaxies as measured by several large optical surveys. In total, 6,273 galaxy–AGN pairs were found. We carefully account for the systematics of the cross-matched sources and find that Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI LS) data are significantly less affected by them. Using DESI LS data, with which 5,853 galaxy–AGN pairs were cross-matched, we find a weak but significant alignment signal (withP≲ 0.01) between the parsec-scale AGN jet and the kiloparsec-scale projected minor axis of the optical host galaxy in sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. Our results show that the observed source properties are connected over three orders of magnitude in scale. This finding points towards an intimate connection between a SMBH, its host galaxy and its subsequent evolution.
The James Webb Space Telescope can potentially explore the geological diversity of the surfaces of rocky exoplanets, especially due to its access to mid-infrared wavelengths. Here we investigate the level of geological detail that it could be possible to observe with the low-resolution spectroscopy and photometric modes of the mid-infrared instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. We used new emissivity measurements of 15 basaltic samples between 2 μm and 25 μm to produce synthetic spectra and photometric fluxes. We found that the mid-infrared instrument can, in principle, distinguish several specific mineralogical and bulk chemical signals among relatively similar rocks. In particular, hydrous minerals, such as amphibole and serpentine, which would signal the existence of past or present water, can have observable characteristics in both low-resolution spectroscopy observations (with the precision of 5 eclipses) and the integrated fluxes over mid-infrared instrument filter bandwidths (20–100 eclipses). Photometric fluxes are also sensitive to bulk compositions (for example, wt% Al2O3), which reflect magmatic processes. Our work demonstrates the potential for the James Webb Space Telescope and future observatories to access a fuller picture of exoplanet surface geology.
In this paper, we study the relationship between the phase transition and Lyapunov exponents for 4D Hayward anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole. We consider the motion of massless and massive particles around an unstable circular orbit of the Hayward AdS black hole in the equatorial plane and calculate the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. The phase transition is found to be well described by the multivaled Lyapunov exponents. It is also found that different phases of Hayward AdS black hole coincide with different branches of the Lyapunov exponents. We also study the discontinuous change in the Lyapunov exponents and find that it can serve as an order parameter near the critical point. The critical exponent of change in Lyapunov exponent near the critical point is found to be 1/2.
The Voyager 2 flyby of Uranus in 1986 revealed an unusually oblique and off-centred magnetic field. This single in situ measurement has been the basis of our interpretation of Uranus’s magnetosphere as the canonical extreme magnetosphere of the solar system; with inexplicably intense electron radiation belts and a severely plasma-depleted magnetosphere. However, the role of external forcing by the solar wind has rarely been considered in explaining these observations. Here we revisit the Voyager 2 dataset to show that Voyager 2 observed Uranus’s magnetosphere in an anomalous, compressed state that we estimate to be present less than 5% of the time. If the spacecraft had arrived only a few days earlier, the upstream solar wind dynamic pressure would have been ~20 times lower, resulting in a dramatically different magnetospheric configuration. We postulate that such a compression of the magnetosphere could increase energetic electron fluxes within the radiation belts and empty the magnetosphere of its plasma temporarily. Therefore, the interpretation of Uranus’s magnetosphere as being extreme may simply be a product of a flyby that occurred under extreme upstream solar wind conditions.
Machine learning, particularly neural networks, has rapidly permeated most activities and work where data has a story to tell. Recently, deep learning has started to be used for solving differential equations with input from physics, also known as Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs). Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) applications in numerical relativity remain mostly unexplored. To remedy this situation, we present the first study of applying PINNs to solve in the time domain the Zerilli and the Regge-Wheeler equations for Schwarzschild black hole perturbations. The fundamental difference of our work with other PINN studies in black hole perturbations is that, instead of working in the frequency domain, we solve the equations in the time domain, an approach commonly used in numerical relativity to study initial value problems. To evaluate the accuracy of PINNs results, we compare the extracted quasi-normal modes with those obtained with finite difference methods. For comparable grid setups, the PINN results are similar to those from finite difference methods and differ from those obtained in the frequency domain by a few percent. As with other applications of PINNs for solving partial differential equations, the efficiency of neural networks over other methods emerges when applied to large dimensionality or high complexity problems. Our results support the viability of PINNs in numerical relativity, but more work is needed to assess their performance in problems such as the collision of compact objects.
We examine the black-hole limits of the family of static and spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein field equations for polytropic matter, that was presented in a previous paper. This exploration is done in the asymptotic sub-regions of the allowed regions of the parameter planes of that family of solutions, for a few values of the polytropic indexn, with the limitation that\(n>1\). These allowed regions were determined and discussed in some detail in another previous paper. The characteristics of these limits are examined and analyzed. We find that there are different types of black-hole limits, with specific characteristics involving the local temperature of the matter. We also find that the limits produce a very unexpected but specific type of spacetime geometry in the interior of the black holes, which we analyze in detail. Regarding the spatial part of the interior geometry, we show that in the black-hole limits there is a general collapse of all spatial distances to zero. Regarding the temporal part, there results an infinite overall red shift in the limits, with respect to the flat space at radial infinity, over the whole interior region. The analysis of the interior geometry leads to a very surprising connection with quantum-mechanical studies in the background metric of a naked Schwarzschild black hole. The nature of the solutions in the black-hole limits leads to the definition of a new type of singularity in General Relativity. We argue that the black-hole limits cannot actually be taken all the way to their ultimate conclusion, due to the fact that this would lead to the violation of some essential physical and mathematical conditions. These include questions of consistency of the solutions, questions involving infinite energies, and questions involving violations of the quantum behavior of matter. However, one can still approach these limiting situations to a very significant degree, from the physical standpoint, so that the limits can still be considered, at least for some purposes, as useful and simpler approximate representations of physically realizable configurations with rather extreme properties.
Hyperboloidal slices are spacelike slices that reach future null infinity. Their asymptotic behaviour is different from Cauchy slices, which are traditionally used in numerical relativity simulations. This work uses free evolution of the formally-singular conformally compactified Einstein equations in spherical symmetry. One way to construct gauge conditions suitable for this approach relies on building the gauge source functions from a time-independent background spacetime metric. This background reference metric is set using the height function approach to provide the correct asymptotics of hyperboloidal slices of Minkowski spacetime. The present objective is to study the effect of different choices of height function on hyperboloidal evolutions via the reference metrics used in the gauge conditions. A total of 10 reference metrics for Minkowski are explored, identifying some of their desired features. They include 3 hyperboloidal layer constructions, evolved with the non-linear Einstein equations for the first time. Focus is put on long-term numerical stability of the evolutions, including small initial gauge perturbations. The results will be relevant for future (puncture-type) hyperboloidal evolutions, 3D simulations and the development of coinciding Cauchy and hyperboloidal data, among other applications.
This paper is the initial part of a comprehensive study of spacetimes that admit the canonical forms of Killing tensor in General Relativity. The general scope of the study is to derive either new exact solutions of Einstein’s equations that exhibit hidden symmetries or to identify the hidden symmetries in already known spacetimes that may emerge during the resolution process. In this preliminary paper, we first introduce the canonical forms of Killing tensor, based on a geometrical approach to classify the canonical forms of symmetric 2-rank tensors, as postulated by R. V. Churchill. Subsequently, the derived integrability conditions of the canonical forms serve as additional equations transforming the under-determined system of equations, comprising of Einstein’s Field Equations and the Bianchi Identities (in vacuum with\(\Lambda \)), into an over-determined one. Using a null rotation around the null tetrad frame we manage to simplify the system of equations to the point where the geometric characterization (Petrov Classification) of the extracted solutions can be performed and their null congruences can be characterized geometrically. Therein, we obtain multiple special algebraic solutions according to the Petrov classification (D, III, N, O) where some of them appeared to be new. The latter becomes possible since our analysis is embodied with the usage of the Newman-Penrose formalism of null tetrads.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most widespread compounds in the universe, accounting for up to ~25% of all interstellar carbon. Since most unsubstituted PAHs do not possess permanent electric dipole moments, they are invisible to radio astronomy. Constraining their abundances relies on the detection of polar chemical proxies, such as aromatic nitriles. Here we report the detection of 2-cyanopyrene and 4-cyanopyrene, isomers of the recently detected 1-cyanopyrene. We find that these isomers are present in an abundance ratio of ~2:1:2, which mirrors the number of equivalent sites available for CN addition. We conclude that there is evidence that the cyanopyrene isomers formed by direct CN addition to pyrene under kinetic control in hydrogen-rich gas at 10 K and discuss constraints on the H/CN ratio for PAHs in the Taurus molecular cloud (TMC-1). Our detections of the cyanopyrene isomers suggest that small PAHs like pyrene must be either formed in or transported to the cold interstellar medium, challenging assumptions about the origin and fate of PAHs in space.
In the present paper, the dual symmetries of dense quark matter phase diagram found in some massless three- and two-color NJL models in the mean field approximation have been shown to exist at a more fundamental level as dual transformations of fields and chemical potentials leaving the Lagrangian invariant. As a result, the corresponding dual symmetries of the full phase diagram can be shown without any approximation. And it has been shown not only in the NJL models, but also in framework of two- and three-color massless QCD itself. This is quite interesting, since one might say that it is not very common to show something completely non-perturbatively in QCD.
It’s widely recognized that the free energy landscape captures the essentials of thermodynamic phase transitions. In this work, we extend the findings of [1] by incorporating the nonextensive nature of black hole entropy. Specifically, the connection between black hole phase transitions and the winding number of Riemann surfaces derived through complex analysis is extended to the Rényi entropy framework. This new geometrical and nonextensive formalism is employed to predict the phase portraits of charged-flat black holes within both the canonical and grand canonical ensembles. Furthermore, we elucidate novel relations between the number of sheets comprising the Riemann surface of the Hawking–Page and Van der Waals transitions and the dimensionality of black hole spacetimes. Notably, these new numbers are consistent with those found for charged-AdS black holes in Gibbs–Boltzmann statistics, providing another significant example of the potential connection between the cosmological constant and the nonextensive Rényi parameter.
Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a surprisingly abundant population of faint, dusty active galactic nuclei atz≈ 4–7. Together with the presence of supermassive black holes atz> 6, this raises questions about the formation and growth histories of early black holes. Current theories for the formation of seed black holes from the death of the first stars (that is, light seeds) and/or the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds (that is, heavy seeds) still lack observational confirmation. Here we present LID-568, a low-mass (7.2 × 106M⊙) black hole hosting powerful outflows that is observed in an extreme phase of rapid growth at redshiftz≈ 4. This object is similar to other JWST-discovered faint active galactic nuclei populations, but is bright in X-ray emission and accreting at more than 4,000% of the limit at which radiation pressure exceeds the force of gravitational attraction of the black hole (that is, super-Eddington accretion). Analysis of JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph integral field unit data reveals spatially extended Hα emission with velocities of ~−600–−500 km s−1relative to the central black hole, indicative of robust nuclear-driven outflows. LID-568 represents an elusive low-mass black hole experiencing super-Eddington accretion as invoked by models of early black hole formation. This discovery showcases a previously undiscovered key parameter space and offers crucial insights into rapid black hole growth mechanisms in the early universe.
We investigated the Strong Cosmic Censorship (SCC) conjecture in Einstein–Power–Maxwell–de Sitter (EPMdS) black holes by analyzing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a massless neutral scalar field perturbation. Using the pseudospectral method, we calculated the QNM frequencies across various cosmological constants and nonlinear electromagnetic parameters. Our results show that for black holes far from extremality, the lowest QNM frequency\(-\text {Im} (\omega )/\kappa _-\)remains below 1/2. However, as the black holes approach extremality, the lowest mode’s\(-\text {Im} (\omega )/\kappa _-\)consistently exceeds 1/2, leading to a violation of SCC. Moreover, with a fixed cosmological constant, as the nonlinearity parameter\(\alpha \)increases, the interval of SCC violation under the charge extremality ratio narrows. Considering that\(k = 1/2 + 1/\alpha \)is inversely proportional to\(\alpha \), our results indicate that increasing the orderkof the non-linear electromagnetic field can effectively mitigate SCC violations.
The Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) appears from fundamental symmetries in quantum field theories, but its physical origin is still to be understood. High-precision experimental searches for small PEP violations permit testing key assumptions of the Standard Model with high sensitivity. We report on a dedicated measurement with Gator, a low-background, high-purity germanium detector operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, aimed at testing PEP-violating atomic transitions in lead. The experimental technique, relying on forming a new symmetry state by introducing electrons into the pre-existing electron system through a direct current, satisfies the conditions of the Messiah-Greenberg superselection rule. No PEP violation has been observed, and an upper limit on the PEP violation probability of\(\beta ^2/2 < 4.8 \cdot 10^{-29}\)(90% CL) is set. This improves the previous constraint from a comparable measurement by more than one order of magnitude.
We study dark matter scattering off\( ^4\)He and other light nuclei using chiral effective field theory. We consider scalar DM interactions and include both one- and two-nucleon scattering processes. The DM interactions and nuclear wave functions are obtained from chiral effective field theory and we work up to fourth order in the chiral expansion for the latter to investigate the chiral convergence. The results for the scattering rates can be used to determine the sensitivity of planned experiments to detect relatively light dark matter particles using\( ^4\)He. We find that next-to-leading-order scalar currents are smaller than expected from power counting for scattering off\( ^4\)He confirming earlier work. However, the results for two-nucleon corrections exhibit a linear regulator dependence indicating potential problems in the applied power counting. We observe a linear correlation between the, in principle not observable, D-wave probability of various light nuclei and the scalar two-nucleon matrix elements, again pointing towards potentially missing contributions.
Antinuclei in our Galaxy may stem either from annihilation or decay of dark matter, or from collisions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, which constitute the background of indirect dark matter searches. Understanding the formation mechanism of (anti)nuclei is crucial for setting limits on their production in space. Coalescence models, which describe the formation of light nuclei from final-state interaction of nucleons, have been widely employed in high-energy collisions. In this work, we introduce ToMCCA (ToyMonteCarloCoalescenceAfterburner), which allows for detailed studies of the nuclear formation processes without the overload of general-purpose event generators. ToMCCA contains parameterizations of the multiplicity dependence of the transverse momentum distributions of protons and of the baryon-emitting source size, extracted from ALICE measurements in pp collisions at\(\sqrt{s} = 5 - 13\)TeV, as well as of the event multiplicity distributions, taken from the EPOS event generator. ToMCCA provides predictions of the deuteron transverse momentum distributions, with agreement of\(\sim 5\%\)with the experimental data. The results of ToMCCA show that the coalescence mechanism in pp collisions depends only on the event multiplicity, not on the collision system or its energy. This allows the model to be utilized for predictions at lower center-of-mass collision energies, which are the most relevant for the production of antinuclei from processes related to dark matter. This model can also be extended to heavier nuclei as long as the target nucleus wavefunction and its Wigner function are known.
We discuss the problem of singularity crossing in isotropic and anisotropic universes. We study at which conditions singularities can disappear in quantum cosmology and how quantum particles behave in the vicinity of singularities. Some attempts to develop general approach to the connection between the field reparametrization and the elimination of singularities is presented as well.
In order to explain the mass hierarchy and mixing pattern in the leptonic sector, we explore an extension of the Standard Model whose scalar sector includes one active and two inert doublets as well as some scalar singlets. The model includes a\(S_3\)family symmetry supplemented by extra cyclic symmetries. As a consequence of our construction, a Dark Matter (DM) candidate is predicted and its properties are consistent with the observed cosmic abundances and the constraints imposed by direct and indirect detection experiments. The model allows Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV) processes like\(\mu \rightarrow e\gamma \)and\(\mu \rightarrow 3e\), but the predicted branching ratios align with experimental limits. Additionally, our analysis elucidates the generation of the active neutrino masses through a one-loop radiative seesaw mechanism matching the observed neutrino oscillation data. The model agrees with experimental data on Higgs Diphoton decay rates and on oblique parameters.
Recently, a factorization theorem was proposed for partonic flavor evolution as defined by the net flavor of the Winner-Take-All axis of a jet. We validate the factorization theorem through explicit calculation at two-loop order, and in the process extract all anomalous dimensions and renormalization factors for any ultraviolet-to-infrared flavor transition at this order. These results can then be used to extract the renormalized hard function for flavored jet production at next-to-next-to-leading order for any process of interest.
Our primary goal is to compare the analytic properties of hydrodynamic series with the stability and causality conditions applied to hydrodynamic modes. Analyticity, in this context, serves as a necessary condition for hydrodynamic series to behave as a univalent function. Stability and causality adhere to physical constraints, ensuring that hydrodynamic modes neither exhibit exponential growth nor travel faster than the speed of light. Through an examination of various hydrodynamic models, such as the Müller–Israel–Stewart (MIS) and the first-order hydro models like the BDNK (Bemfica–Disconzi–Noronha–Kovtun) model, we observe no new restrictions stemming from the univalence limits in the shear channels. However, local univalence is maintained in the sound channel of these models despite the global divergence of the hydrodynamic series. Notably, differences in the sound equations between the MIS and BDNK models lead to distinct limits. The MIS model’s sound mode remains univalent at high momenta within a specific transport range. Conversely, in the BDNK model, the univalence of the sound mode extends to intermediate momenta across all stable and causal regions. Generally, the convergence radius is independent of univalence, and the given dispersion relation predominantly influences their correlation. For second-order frequency dispersions, the relationship is precise; i.e., within the convergence radius, the hydro series demonstrates univalence. However, with higher-order dispersions, the hydro series is locally univalent within certain transport regions, which may fall within or outside the stable and causal zones.
We briefly analyzed the equation of state and critical points of the quantum-corrected-AdS black hole and used the Melnikov method to study its thermal chaotic behavior in the extended phase space of flat, closed, and open universes. The results show that the black hole’s thermodynamic behavior is similar to that of the Van der Waals system. Although the critical ratios at the critical points in the three types of universes differ, they are all independent of the quantum correction parameter. Only an open universe can attain the critical ratio of\(\frac{3}{8}\)corresponding to the Van der Waals system, while in the other two universes, the critical ratio is always greater than this value. For chaos, time perturbations will lead to chaotic behavior when their amplitude exceeds a critical value that depends on the quantum correction parameter and the radius of the dust sphere in the FRW model. Based on this, we found that the chaotic behavior of the black hole varies across different universes depending on the quantum correction parameter, but this parameter always makes chaos more likely. Using the value of the quantum correction parameter determined by Meissner, chaos is always more difficult to occur in an open universe compared to the other two types of universes. Which universe is most prone to chaos depends on the radius of the dust sphere. Finally, chaotic behavior is always present under spatial perturbations.
In recent times, the study of the Casimir effect in quantum field theory has garnered increasing attention because of its potential to be an ideal source of exotic matter needed for stabilizing traversable wormholes. It has been confirmed through experimental evidence that this phenomenon involves fluctuations in the vacuum field, leading to a negative energy density. Motivated by the above, we have investigated Casimir wormholes with corrections from the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) within the framework of matter-coupled teleparallel gravity. Our analysis includes three well-known GUP models: the Kempf, Mangano, and Mann (KMM) model, the Detournay, Gabriel, and Spindel (DGS) model, and a third model called Model II. For a broader analysis, we have considered two well-known model functions for the teleparallel theory: a linear\(f(T,\mathcal {T})=\alpha T+\beta \mathcal {T}\)and a quadratic model\(f(T,\mathcal {T})=\eta T^2+\chi \mathcal {T}\). The shape function solutions corresponding to both models are examined in the absence of tidal forces in spacetime. We also demonstrate the crucial role played by the parameters of the\(f(T,\mathcal {T})\)models in the violation of the energy conditions. With the increasing interest in detecting gravitational waves from astrophysical objects, we have thoroughly discussed the perturbation of the wormhole solutions in the scalar, electromagnetic, axial gravitational, and Dirac field backgrounds. We employ the 3rd order WKB expansion to find the complex frequencies associated with the quasinormal modes of energy dissipation. Additionally, we also calculate the active mass and total gravitational energy for the wormhole geometry. The amount of exotic matter involved in sustaining these wormholes is also found in this paper. Furthermore, the physical stability of such Casimir wormholes is examined using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation.
Building on previous work, we extend an algebraic realisation of three fermion generations within the complex Clifford algebra\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\)by incorporating a\(U(1)_{em}\)gauge symmetry. The algebra\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\)corresponds to the algebra of complex linear maps from the (complexification of the) Cayley–Dickson algebra of sedenions,\(\mathbb {S}\), to itself. Previous work represented three generations of fermions with\(SU(3)_C\)colour symmetry permuted by an\(S_3\)symmetry of order-three, but failed to include aU(1) generator that assigns the correct electric charge to all states. Furthermore, the three generations suffered from a degree of linear dependence between states. By generalising the embedding of the discrete group\(S_3\), corresponding to automorphisms of\(\mathbb {S}\), into\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\), we include an\(S_3\)-invariantU(1) that correctly assigns electric charge. First-generation states are represented in terms of two even\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\)semi-spinors, obtained from two minimal left ideals, related to each other via the order-two\(S_3\)symmetry. The remaining two generations are obtained by applying the\(S_3\)symmetry of order-three to the first generation. In this model, the gauge symmetries,\(SU(3)_C\times U(1)_{em}\), are\(S_3\)-invariant and preserve the semi-spinors. As a result of the generalised embedding of the\(S_3\)automorphisms of\(\mathbb {S}\)into\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\), the three generations are now linearly independent.
State-of-the-art simulations of high-energy nuclear collisions rely on hybrid setups, involving in particular a pre-equilibrium stage to let the system evolve from a far-from-equilibrium initial condition towards a near-equilibrated state after which fluid dynamics can be applied meaningfully. A known issue is the mismatch between the equation of state in the fluid-dynamical evolution and the effective one in the previous stage, which leads to discontinuities at the interface between the two models. Here we introduce a new matching prescription at this interface, based on the entropy, and we compare it with the standard one relying on local energy conservation. We study the behavior of various quantities at the switching time between the models and investigate a number of final-state hadronic observables. For the latter, we show that they are not modified significantly by the choice of matching prescription, provided an appropriate normalization is chosen for the initial state. In turn, our approach reduces sizeably the ratio of bulk over thermodynamic pressure at the beginning of the fluid-dynamical stage.
In this paper, we explore the quantum properties of three-flavor neutrino propagating in a Schwarzschild metric. It is found that the different strength of gravitational effects are obtained by adjusting the magnitude of\(\mathrm GM\)arising in the oscillation phase. Using the weak field approximations, we show that the gravitational effects can make the entanglement oscillates over a large rage when\(\textrm{GM}=5.1\times 10^8 \, \textrm{Km}\)and\(\textrm{GM}=7\times 10^7 \, \textrm{Km}\), respectively, Moreover, for\(\textrm{GM}=4.8\times 10^8 \, \textrm{Km}\)and\(\textrm{GM}=9.3\times 10^7 \, \textrm{Km}\), the suppression of the entanglement can be observed due to the gravitational effects. Meanwhile, in this case, the gravitational effects also make the distribution of entanglement tighter through investing the entanglement complete monogamy relation. Furthermore, we examine the gravitational effects on the violation of the Svetlichny inequality to study the nonlocality of the system. It is shown that when\(\textrm{GM}=6\times 10^8 \, \textrm{Km}\)and\(\textrm{GM}=7\times 10^7 \, \textrm{Km}\), the gravitational effects make the Svetlichny parameters always greater than 4, implying that the genuine tripartite nonlocality of the system is always present. However, the gravitational effects also restrain the violation of the Svetlichny to make the regions of the absence of nonlocality increase. The gravitational effects on the monogamy property of nonlocality lies in the change of the effective bound of the maximum bipartite nonlocality of the neutrinos system. Therefore, our investigations may be helpful to understanding of quantumness of the neutrinos system in curved space-time.
The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered a surprising population of bright galaxies in the very early Universe (≲500 Myr after the Big Bang) that is hard to explain with conventional galaxy-formation models and whose physical properties are not fully understood. Insight into their internal physics is best captured through nebular lines, but at these early epochs, the brightest of these spectral features are redshifted into the mid-infrared and remain elusive. Using the mid-infrared instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope, here we present a detection of Hα and doubly ionized oxygen ([Oiii] 4959,5007 Å) from the bright, ultra-high-redshift galaxy candidate GHZ2/GLASS-z12. Based on these emission lines, we infer a spectroscopic redshift ofz= 12.33 ± 0.04, placing this galaxy just ~400 Myr after the Big Bang. These observations provide key insights into the conditions of this primaeval, luminous galaxy, which shows hard ionizing conditions rarely seen in the local Universe and probably driven by a compact and young burst (≲30 Myr) of star formation. The galaxy’s oxygen-to-hydrogen abundance is close to a tenth of the solar value, indicating a rapid metal enrichment. This study establishes the unique conditions of this notably bright and distant galaxy and the huge potential of mid-infrared observations to characterize these primordial systems.
Inspired by the great progress in the observations of charmonium-like states in recent years, we perform a systematic analysis about the ground states and the first radially excited states of\(qc\bar{q}\bar{c}\)(q=u/dands) tetraquark systems. Their mass spectra, root mean square (r.m.s.) radii and radial density distributions are predicted within the framework of relativized quark model. By comparing with experimental data, some potential candidates for hidden-charm tetraquark states are suggested. For\(qc\bar{q}\bar{c}\)(q=u/d) system, if\(Z_{c}(3900)\)is supposed to be a compact tetraquark state with\(J^{PC}=1^{+-}\),Z(4430) can be interpreted as the first radially excited states of\(Z_{c}(3900)\). Another broad structure\(Z_{c}(4200)\)can also be explained as a partner of\(Z_{c}(3900)\), and it arise from a higher state with\(J^{PC}=1^{+-}\). In addition, theoretical predictions indicate that the possible assignments forX(3930),X(4050) andX(4250) are low lying\(0^{++}\)tetraquark states. As for the\(sc\bar{s}\bar{c}\)system,X(4140) andX(4274) structures can be interpreted as this type of tetraquark states with\(J^{PC}=1^{++}\), andX(4350) can be described as a\(sc\bar{s}\bar{c}\)tetraquark with\(J^{PC}=0^{++}\). With regard to\(qc\bar{s}\bar{c}\)(q=u/d) system, we find two potential candidates for this type of tetraquark, which are\(Z_{cs}(4000)\)and\(Z_{cs}(4220)\)structures. The measured masses of these two structures are in agreement with theoretical predictions for the\(1^{+}\)state.
This paper describes measurements of the transverse momentum spectra ofWandZbosons produced in proton–proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of\(\sqrt{s}=5.02\)TeV and\(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Measurements are performed in the electron and muon channels,\(W\rightarrow \ell \nu \)and\(Z\rightarrow \ell \ell \)(\(\ell =e\)or\(\mu \)), and forWevents further separated by charge. The data were collected in 2017 and 2018, in dedicated runs with reduced instantaneous luminosity, and correspond to 255 and 338\(\hbox {pb}^{-1}\)at\(\sqrt{s}=5.02\)TeV and 13 TeV, respectively. These conditions optimise the reconstruction of theW-boson transverse momentum. The distributions observed in the electron and muon channels are unfolded, combined, and compared to QCD calculations based on parton shower Monte Carlo event generators and analytical resummation. The description of the transverse momentum distributions by Monte Carlo event generators is imperfect and shows significant differences largely common to\(W^-\),\(W^+\)andZproduction. The agreement is better at\(\sqrt{s}=5.02\)TeV, especially for predictions that were tuned toZproduction data at\(\sqrt{s}=7\)TeV. Higher-order, resummed predictions based onDYTurbogenerally match the data best across the spectra. Distribution ratios are also presented and test the understanding of differences between the production processes.
Nearly one-third of objects occupying the most circular, coplanar Kuiper belt orbits (the cold classical belt) are binary, and several percent of them are ‘ultra-wide’ binaries (UWBs): ~100-km-sized companions spaced by tens of thousands of kilometres. UWBs are dynamically fragile, and their existence is thought to constrain the early Solar System processes and conditions. However, we demonstrate that UWBs can instead attain their wide architectures well after the earliest epochs of the Solar System, when the orbital migration of Neptune implants the modern non-cold, or ‘dynamic’, Kuiper belt population. During this implantation, cold classical belt binaries are likely to have close encounters with many planetesimals scattered across the region, which can efficiently dissociate any existing UWBs and widen a small fraction of tighter binaries into UWB-like arrangements. Thus, today’s UWBs may not be primordial and cannot be used to constrain the early Solar System as directly as previously surmised.
We give a family of exact solutions of\(N=1\)supergravity field equations in\(D=4\)dimensions that describe the collision of plane-fronted gravitino waves.
The CYGNO experiment aims to build a large (\(\mathcal {O}(10)\)m\(^3\)) directional detector for rare event searches, such as nuclear recoils (NRs) induced by dark matter (DM), such as weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs). The detector concept comprises a time projection chamber (TPC), filled with a He:CF\(_4\)60/40 scintillating gas mixture at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, equipped with an amplification stage made of a stack of three gas electron multipliers (GEMs) which are coupled to an optical readout. The latter consists in scientific CMOS (sCMOS) cameras and photomultipliers tubes (PMTs). The maximisation of the light yield of the amplification stage plays a major role in the determination of the energy threshold of the experiment. In this paper, we simulate the effect of the addition of a strong electric field below the last GEM plane on the GEM field structure and we experimentally test it by means of a 10\(\times \)10 cm\(^2\)readout area prototype. The experimental measurements analyse stacks of different GEMs and helium concentrations in the gas mixture combined with this extra electric field, studying their performances in terms of light yield, energy resolution and intrinsic diffusion. It is found that the use of this additional electric field permits large light yield increases without degrading intrinsic characteristics of the amplification stage with respect to the regular use of GEMs.
In this paper, we study the discovery potential of a Vector-LikeBquark (VLB) via the process\(pp \rightarrow B(\rightarrow bZ)j\rightarrow b(Z \rightarrow \nu _l\bar{\nu _l})j\)at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with\(\sqrt{s}=14\)TeV. In the framework of a simplified model, we perform a scan over its parameter space and test its viability following a Monte Carlo analysis developed to include all production and decay dynamics. We use cut-and-count combined with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) methods to classify the signal and background events in order to improve the efficiency of signal identification and background rejection. We find that this approach can reduce background events significantly while the signal retention rate is much higher than that of traditional methods, thereby improving the VLB discovery potential. We then calculate the exclusion and discovery capabilities for VLBs and find that the advantages of the cut-and-count plus XGBoost method especially lie in the high-mass region, i.e.,\(m_B > 1500 \text { GeV}\). We finally obtain the following LHC results in terms of the coupling and chiral structure of a singlet heavy VLB interactions: (i) for\(g^{*}=0.2\)and\(R_L=0\)with 3000 fb\(^{-1}\), theBquark mass can be be excluded (discovered) up to 3000 GeV (2500 GeV); (ii) for\(g^{*}=0.2\)and\(R_L=0.5\)with 3000 fb\(^{-1}\), the exclusion (discovery) region can reach up to 4750 GeV (4250 GeV).
Motivated by the impact of the phantom field (or anti-Maxwell field) on the structure of three-dimensional black holes in the presence of the cosmological constant, we present the first extraction of solutions for the phantom BTZ (A)dS black hole. In this study, we analyze the effect of the phantom field on the horizon structure. Furthermore, we compare the BTZ black holes in the presence of both the phantom and Maxwell fields. Additionally, we calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the phantom BTZ black holes, demonstrating their compliance with the first law of thermodynamics. Subsequently, we assess the effects of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on the local stability in the canonical ensemble by considering these fields with respect to the heat capacity. We then investigate the global stability area of the BTZ black holes with phantom and Maxwell fields within the grand canonical ensemble using Gibbs free energy. In this analysis, we evaluate the influence of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on this area.
Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE\(\nu \)NS) poses an irreducible background in the search for dark matter-nucleus elastic scatterings, which is commonly known as the neutrino floor. As direct dark matter search experiments keep improving their sensitivity into so far unexplored regions, they face the challenge of approaching this neutrino floor. A precise description of the CE\(\nu \)NS signal is therefore crucial for the description of backgrounds for future DM searches. In this work we discuss the scenario of detecting neutrinos in low-threshold, high-exposure cryogenic solid state experiments optimized for the search of low-mass dark matter. The energy range considered is completely dominated by solar neutrinos. In absence of any dark matter events, we treat solar neutrinos as the main signal of interest. We show that sensitivity to the flux of neutrinos from different production mechanisms can be achieved. In particular we investigate the sensitivity to the flux of pp and\(^{7}\)Be neutrinos, as well as CNO neutrinos. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity to dark matter signals in the presence of a solar neutrino background for different experimental scenarios, which are defined by three parameters: the target material, the energy threshold and the exposure. We show that experiments with thresholds of\(\mathcal {O}\)(eV) and exposures of\(\mathcal {O}\)(tonne-years), using\(\hbox {CaWO}_{4}\)or\(\hbox {Al}_{2}\hbox {O}_{3}\)targets, have discovery potential for dark matter interaction cross sections in the neutrino floor.
We study the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon,\(g_\mu - 2 \equiv 2 a_\mu \), in the context of supersymmetric models beyond the CMSSM, where the unification of either the gaugino masses\(M_{1,2,3}\)or sfermion and Higgs masses is relaxed, taking into account the measured mass of the Higgs boson,\(m_H\), the cosmological dark matter density and the direct detection rate. We find that the model with non-unified gaugino masses can make a contribution\(\Delta a_\mu \sim 20 \times 10^{-10}\)to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, for example if\(M_{1,2} \sim 600\; \textrm{GeV}\)and\(M_3\sim 8 \; \textrm{TeV}\). The model with non-universal sfermion and Higgs masses can provide even larger\(\Delta a_\mu \sim 24 \times 10^{-10}\)if the sfermion masses for the first and the second generations are\( \sim 400 \; \textrm{GeV}\)and that of the third is\( \sim 8 \; \textrm{TeV}\). We discuss the prospects for collider searches for supersymmetric particles in specific benchmark scenarios illustrating these possibilities, focusing in particular on the prospects for detecting the lighter smuon and the lightest neutralino.
In this paper, we investigate the time dependent black holes in the frame of Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet theory having two scalar fields and investigate the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW). In the reconstructed models, there often appear ghosts, which could be eliminated by imposing some constraints. We investigate the behavior of high-frequency gravitational waves by examining the effects of varying Gauss–Bonnet coupling during their propagation. The speed of propagation changes due to the coupling during the black hole formation process. The propagation speed of gravitational waves differs when they enter the black hole compared to when they exit.
Testing possible variations in fundamental constants of nature is a crucial endeavor in observational cosmology. This paper investigates potential cosmological variations in the fine structure constant (\(\alpha \)) through a non-parametric approach, using galaxy cluster observations as the primary cosmological probe. We employ two methodologies based on galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements derived from X-ray and Sunyaev–Zeldovich observations, along with luminosity distances from type Ia supernovae. We also explore how different values of the Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) impact the variation of\(\alpha \)across cosmic history. When using the Planck satellite’s\(H_0\)observations, a constant\(\alpha \)is ruled out at approximately the 3\(\sigma \)confidence level for\(z \lesssim 0.5\). Conversely, employing local estimates of\(H_0\)restores agreement with a constant\(\alpha \).
