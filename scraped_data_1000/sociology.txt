In the United States and within Colorado, the number of persons experiencing homelessness has risen, with over 600,000 counted on a single night in 2023. Limited data integration across healthcare and social services hinders understanding of how permanent supportive housing (PSH) affects health outcomes. Our study in partnership with healthcare experts, housing providers, and a community advisory panel aimed to integrate data from health records, the justice system, and housing case manager notes to create a multidimensional measure of PSH success. Metrics not only included housing retention but engagement in care, wellness, housing rule adherence, and overall success. The initial 608 records were reduced to an analytic sample of 180 due to data loss across systems. Findings highlighted case managers’ adaptability and the need for dynamic indicators of client progress. This study underscores the importance of a social-health information exchange and partnerships for improving access and understanding success in supportive housing.
This paper looks at the effect of culture of origin on immigrants’ preferences for redistribution. This study is motivated by rising policy charged discussion about cultural determinants of individual preferences and prior research by Luttmer and Singhal “Culture, Context, and the Taste for Redistribution” published in the American Economic Journal (2011). The previous study claims that immigrants keep their preferences for redistribution after immigration, and these preferences are culturally driven even when the comprehensive range of economic factors are controlled. However, the highly topical political debate forces us to ask the same question again and to re-check the robustness of association between preferences of immigrants and average preferences in their countries of origin. This paper extends both the temporal and geographical scope of the study and introduces non-economic parameters typical for immigrants into explanatory models. The main message of the paper is that immigrants experience the effect of culture of origin on their preferences, but the updated and extended data show that the size of the effect is generally half that found in previous studies. This research has both political and methodological relevance.
Transitioning from kindergartens to elementary schools marks a critical period for young children and children’s school readiness is a strong predictor of their future educational attainment. The purpose of this study was to examine the relations between family socioeconomic status (SES) and Chinese preschoolers’ cognitive and non-cognitive school readiness outcomes and to further explore the moderating role of parental involvement in these relations. A total of 311 five-six years old kindergarteners and their parents living in Shanghai, China participated in the study. Parents reported demographic information and their involvement in children’s education. Children’s school readiness was rated by their teachers based on daily observations. Findings of this study indicated that family SES was positively associated with children’s cognitive school readiness (i.e., communication and general knowledge and language and cognition) but not significantly related to non-cognitive school readiness (i.e., social competence and emotional maturity). Parental involvement moderated the relations between family SES and children’s cognitive and non-cognitive school readiness. In the context of low home-based parental involvement and home-school conferencing, family SES was related to children’s cognitive school readiness, while in the context of high home-based parental involvement and home-school conferencing, family SES was not associated with children’s cognitive readiness. Unexpectedly, family SES was negatively related to children’s social-emotional readiness outcomes when parents displayed high levels of home-based parental involvement. Implications for practice and suggestions for further research were also discussed.
Despite the Chinese government’s implementation of numerous policies aimed at promoting urbanization, the actual urbanization rate has not met expectations. Even when some rural migrants are presented with opportunities to convert tourban-hukoustatus, an increasing number of families opt to maintain adual-hukouarrangement (where one spouse holdsrural-hukouand the other holdsurban-hukou). This phenomenon has garnered significant attention; however, the impact of diverse access to urban welfare on migrants’hukouselection has been underexplored in existing research onhukouconversion. Access to urban welfare emerges as a critical factor influencinghukouselection decisions. This study constructs an analytical framework to examine thehukouarrangements ofdual-hukoufamilies, exploring the effects of various factors related to urban welfare acquisition on thehukouselection of rural migrants. Empirical results indicate that withindual-hukoufamilies, migrants withrural-hukoustatus can obtain urban welfare through family support or market purchases. Consequently, to maximize family benefits, they prefer to retain theirrural-hukoustatus rather than convert tourban-hukou. Conversely, possession of a qualification certificate from the host city negatively impactsrural-hukouretention. Additionally, rural migrants indual-hukoufamilies tend to favor cities with high-valuehukouand express a desire to convert to localhukoustatus. These findings offer robust insights for policymaking, demonstrating resilience against sample self-selection bias and reverse causality.
Flexible working arrangements have become increasingly common and are considered a means to better reconcile paid and unpaid work. Therefore, the use of such measures can determine how couples divide their household and childcare tasks. While currently these tasks are dominantly female connotated, an increase in flexible work arrangements may contribute to a more gender-egalitarian distribution of unpaid work. However, empirical evidence on this association is mixed, and it remains unclear to what extent it differs by gender. Using a sample of 3244 individuals in the German Family Panel of 2018/2019 who were cohabiting with an opposite-sex partner and by applying linear regression models, we tested several hypotheses derived from economic, gender, and time-availability approaches. We separately addressed the division of housework and childcare tasks related to three flexible work measures, namely home-office, schedule flexibility, and working-time autonomy. Contrary to our hypotheses, no flexibility measure seemed to be related to a higher share of household tasks. Rather, any significant association we identified was fully explained through gender: Women took on a larger share of any household task, irrespective of their work flexibility. Only the share of childcare performed seemed to differ by the use of schedule flexibility, as well as by gender. Whereas mothers’ contributions to childcare were larger when they used flexibility, those of fathers were smaller. We conclude that flexible working arrangements do not contribute to a more gender-egalitarian division of unpaid work per se, but the (gendered) motivation to use such flexibility may be decisive.
How do sociologists operationalize “romance,” specifically the seriousness or casualness of the romantic relationships of the participants they study? How do research participants themselves understand and define romantic connections in everyday life? Using the case of 80 South Asian Muslim Canadian interviewees and how they used relationship labels like “casual” and “serious” when describing their romantic experiences, this article problematizes the concept of a romantic partnership and bridges sociological conversations about emotions, dating, marriage, and larger discussions about religion, race, gender, and immigration in high-demand religious cultures. Contrary to popular definitions of casual and serious relationships, rather than on sexual intimacy, my participants defined the casualness or seriousness of their relationship based on the marriageability of their partner. Their assessment of a partner’s marriageability rested on the partner’s social compatibility and/or their emotional attachment with the partner. Factors indicating marriageability included race/ethnicity, religion, and socioeconomic status that many participants perceived to be in tension with emotions. On the one hand, emotional connections brought people from different races and faiths together, motivating participants to overcome external hurdles from family and internal biases. On the other hand, people ended relationships with out-group partners despite being in loving relationships for years because they deemed them to be socially incompatible for marriage. However, emotions are hard to control. Sometimes, the relationship deemed to be the most socially compatible was unsuccessful because of a lack of emotional connection. Instead, the relationship with an out-group partner initially deemed incompatible ended up being emotionally significant and meaningful.
Policy makers, scientists, non-governmental organizations, and practitioners are increasingly acknowledging the relevance of biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) for achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. This is however influenced by the personal awareness and interests of stakeholders, which can lead to conflicts about ecosystem management and conservation priorities. In the Global South, where poverty and power asymmetries are more pronounced, inclusive approaches to decision making are crucial to achieve sustainable development “leaving no one behind.” We assessed awareness of different stakeholder groups in the Corumbataí watershed, a UNESCO Geoparks project, about the relevance of ES for their well-being (WB) to determine if the perceptions about their relevance differ among them. We found that stakeholders selected regulating and cultural services as the most relevant ES, while security and health emerged as the most relevant categories of WB. Meanwhile, we found lack of awareness about the relevance of some ES underpinning WB categories they highly valued, e.g., groundwater recharge or rain regulation and its relevance for potable water availability. Gender, education, and age had a significant effect on the valuation of ES and WB categories, with women linking provisioning ES to both security and basic material WB and men connecting provisioning services more often to security. Assessing stakeholders’ perceptions about the relevance of ES for their WB can shed light on personal socio-ecological relations. Tailored education programs could support sustainable development programs.
In today’s debate about a user oriented humanistic turn in the field of mental health care, the early Foucault is once again relevant. In his works from 1954 Foucault shows that the root of understanding mental phenomena is not to be found in universal medical concepts and methods, but in the reflection on lived experiences and in the human being itself. In accordance with contemporary social, community, and cultural psychologists, such as Brinkmann, Kinderman and Prilleltensky, Foucault is critical to the psychology’s medical foundations. Instead of focusing on medical and physiological matters he suggests that psychology, as a discipline, should be more user oriented, and focus more on the human being itself, and on social and cultural contexts.
Most job search intensity models assume uniform search effort across all potential wage offers. I depart from this conventional assumption by proposing that agents allocate wage-specific search intensity, strategically avoiding effort on low-paying, unacceptable jobs or high-paying, improbable ones. This alternative model generates wage distributions at acceptance that differ markedly from the truncated distributions typical of models with constant arrival rates for wage offers. I leverage these distinct empirical predictions to develop two new nonparametric tests, applied to NLSY97 data, both of which reject the hypothesis of constant search intensity across wages. Furthermore, I estimate the structural parameters identifiable in each model, revealing that wage-specific search leads to greater total search effort, faster transitions into the upper tail of the wage distribution, and ultimately higher accepted wages—more than a 25% increase following unemployment. For low wages, the classic random search model delivers a fair replication of the actual data, but for higher wages targeted search is better. Wage-specific search suggests that job seekers not only need to search more, but also search better. This insight has important implications for employment policy, particularly in promoting job search literacy among the unemployed.
This qualitative study aimed to establish aspects of humanistic therapy that young people (13–16 years old) perceived as helpful and hindering, and to test a novel method for identifying perceived processes of change. A “medium q” thematic analysis was conducted followed by a coding-based “process of change analysis.” Participants were 50 young people in London schools who experienced moderate or severe emotional symptoms and had participated in up to 10 sessions of a school-based humanistic intervention. Participants were predominantly female and ethnically heterogeneous. Therapist qualities most often perceived as helpful were affiliative in nature. Unhelpful therapist activities were silences and a lack of input. Young people described feeling free to talk and open up. Helpful outcomes included feeling unburdened, gaining insight, and improving relationships. “Getting things off their chest,” “Advice and guidance,” “Modeling relationships,” and “insights to behavior change” were identified as specific processes of change in over 50% of young people. Approximately one-third felt hindered by a lack of therapist input, silences, or not feeling able to open up or trust. These findings indicate the potential value of an active, “process guiding” stance in humanistic therapy. Our process of change analysis has potential for identifying perceived change mechanisms in therapy.

Research has shown that married individuals live longer lives than unmarried women and men. A smaller number of studies have included non-marital cohabitation and have found that their mortality falls between the married and other unmarried groups. There are indications that the cohabiting population is diverse in terms of mortality risk, yet very little is known about how the association is related to age and stages of the life course. Sweden is a forerunner in family trends, and this is the first study that examines cohabitation and mortality in a Swedish context. Using Swedish register data for the years 2012–2017, we investigated how different partnership statuses are related to mortality for men and women at different ages (N= 5,572,011). We also examine whether the association between cohabitation and mortality is similar after accounting for family-of-origin effects through the use of a sibling comparison design. Our findings confirmed the notion of cohabiters as a diverse group whose relative mortality risk differs depending on the timing of cohabitation. Never-married cohabiters had a mortality risk similar to married couples at younger ages and a gradually increased risk with age. Divorced and widowed cohabiters exhibited an age gradient in the opposite direction. Future research should consider how the context of cohabitation changes across the life course.
In 2021, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Total Fertility Rate in Iceland rose unexpectedly from 1.79 to 1.90. The increased number of births followed an important reform in the Icelandic paid parental leave scheme, which included an expansion of the leave from 10 to 12 months. Analysis of data from Statistics Iceland and focus group interviews with parents who had a child in 2021 were used to explore if and how the parental leave reform and the societal changes related to the pandemic-shaped parents’ decision to have a child in 2021. As the rise in fertility was short-lived, the results indicate that the baby boom of 2021 can hardly be explained by the parental leave reform. Rather, at least for educated women, who already had children and were in a good financial state, it seems that the pandemic created a favourable atmosphere for having a child. Parents’ narratives from the focus group interviews suggest that the pandemic might have been a good time to start or add to the family because of the increased time spent at home and the limited involvement in social activities outside the home.
Although the correlates of loneliness among older adults are very well explored in developed countries, there has been far less quantitative research in developing country contexts. This study helps to redress this research lacuna by investigating the loneliness reports of older adults (> 59 years) in South Africa. The analysis focuses on the considerable variation by race in how adults grow old, including in their living arrangements and socio-economic status. Using national micro-data collected in five waves of the National Income Dynamics Study, the study shows that older white adults report significantly fewer episodes of loneliness than other older adults, although they are far more likely to live alone. The gap in loneliness is greatest between older white and older African adults (who are the most likely to live with others), and it persists in multivariate regressions that control for a range of other differences in their individual and household characteristics. One possible explanation for these persistent race differences, which requires further examination, is that they reflect the importance of cultural factors, which are not adequately modelled, and which influence expectations of social interaction.
This paper explores the connection between social policy and immigration law as one feature of migration governance to advance internal bordering and border internalization. It argues that responsibility for migration governance is being transferred: from immigration authorities and the broader field of immigration policy to social services and the broader field of social policy. This allows for the outsourcing of immigration control to “new” sectors of society. In a second step, immigration authorities borrow legitimacy from social services and related actors involved in assessing non-citizens, thus turning reports from one policy field to the service of assessments made in another. This work draws on empirical data collected from Swiss immigration authorities (Migrationsdienste) and social services (Sozialdienste) whose work concerns migrants in receipt of social assistance. In Switzerland, powerful stereotypes shape the legal residency rights of non-citizens by portraying them as undeserving of welfare, reinforcing a strict citizen vs. non-citizen divide. As I argue, the connections between “workfarist” policies that characterize the Swiss welfare state and restrictive immigration policies legitimate the withdrawal of residence rights from non-citizens rendered destitute. The transfer of responsibility and borrowing of legitimacy facilitated by this entwinement of social policy and immigration law entrench processes of internal bordering. With formerly less related policy fields now increasingly charged with immigration-related decision making, the existing bordering practices of immigration authorities are expanded to encompass new actors. This close entwinement of different policy fields is characteristic of how contemporary societies police and control non-citizens.
Migration studies have highlighted the crucial role of civil society organisations (CSOs) in the local politics of migration. Less explored is the impact of the material conditions under which CSOs operate. And yet CSOs delivering public services to migrant and racialised populations often rely on public funding which has been significantly restructured since neoliberal welfare reforms in many Western countries in the 1990s. This article examines how funding contexts shape the opportunities of CSOs to influence local policymaking on migration and migration-related change from a cross-country and cross-city comparative perspective. Based on the empirical analysis of four cities in France and Germany and a comprehensive dataset comprising interviews, observations and documents, we argue that funding contexts significantly impact on CSOs’ potential to shape local policymaking. They do so by enhancing and restricting (1) CSOs’ access to spaces of policymaking as well as (2) CSOs’ capacities for political engagement. We demonstrate the mediating importance of specific funding structures and politics at both national and local scales as well as the role of state-CSO relations in manifesting and reproducing these funding contexts.
IntroductionGlobally, the prevalence of undernutrition is highest in the sub-Saharan African region with over a third of the world’s stunted children residing in this region. Many studies have explored child nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa, but they often overlook the intricate nuances of maternal knowledge. We examined the association between maternal nutritional knowledge and childhood nutritional outcomes.MethodsThis was a secondary analysis utilizing data from the Demographic and Health Survey of eight sub-Saharan African countries that were conducted between 2019 and 2022, focusing on children aged 6 to 23 months. The study used latent class analysis to identify discrete patterns of nutrition and health-related knowledge and mixed-effects logistic regression to assess their association with childhood nutritional outcomes namely, stunting and wasting. Statistical significance was determined atp< 0.05.ResultsMost participants knew the importance of colostrum (76.8%) and continued breastfeeding (76.7%), as well as immunization (60.0%) and diarrhoea prevention and treatment strategies (65.1%). However, only 24.49% knew about family planning. Children of high knowledge group/class had a 17% lower risk of childhood stunting (crude model; COR = 0.83; 95%CI: 0.77, 0.90, adjusted model; AOR = 0.89; 95%CI: 0.82, 0.97) and a 22% lower risk of wasting (COR = 0.78; 95%CI: 0.69, 0.89, adjusted model; AOR = 0.84; 95%CI: 0.73, 0.96) compared to those from the low knowledge group/class.ConclusionThese results highlight the pivotal role of maternal knowledge in shaping children’s health outcomes and emphasize the urgent need for targeted interventions and comprehensive maternal education programs to address the identified knowledge gaps and improve child health outcomes.
This ethnographic study investigates the perceptions of place and migration aspirations among young migrants within the Malawian diaspora in Lydiate, an informal settlement in Zimbabwe. Unlike traditional conceptions of diaspora that emphasize long-term settlement and place attachment, this study introduces the concept of a ‘radical sense of place,’ where the settlement is viewed not as a permanent home but as a temporary staging ground for future aspirations. Through qualitative data collected between 2018 and 2020, including participant observations and in-depth interviews with young migrants aged 15 to 35, this research explores how these youths strategically navigate their socio-economic marginalization. The findings reveal that young migrants perceive their settlement as a launch pad to better opportunities in more affluent urban areas, driven by a combination of harsh living conditions and the allure of urban life. This perspective challenges existing migration theories by highlighting the temporary and strategic relationships with place among diaspora youths. The study also highlights the interplay between age, identity, and aspirations, showcasing the pivotal role these factors play in shaping the radical decisions of young migrants. While young migrants exhibit resilience in the migration process, they also face social exclusion, lack of social protection, and the risk of abuse and discrimination. The study advocates for policies tailored to address the specific conditions and vulnerabilities faced by youths in diaspora ethnic enclaves, promoting avenues for meaningful employment and advocating for youth migration based on informed choices rather than forced migration.
Authenticity, defined as the knowledge of one’s true self, living in accordance with one’s values and beliefs, and resistance to the influence of others, has gained increasing prominence within the realm of positive psychology. This paper presents the culmination of efforts to develop a Polish version of the Authenticity Scale (AS). The AS is a self-report instrument designed to examine three dimensions of authenticity: authentic living, accepting external influence, and self-alienation. To validate the psychometric properties of the Polish AS, a series of four studies were conducted, encompassing a total number of 1546 participants. The findings demonstrate the instrument’s high internal consistency (with Cronbach’s α ranging from .77 to .87), confirm the three-dimensional structure of authenticity (via confirmatory factor analysis), and provide evidence for measurement invariance across gender groups and under various testing conditions. Theoretical validity was established by investigating the relationships between the authenticity dimensions and a range of variables, including components of the PERMA model, psychological well-being, meaning in life, self-esteem, and personality traits. The observed associations align with theoretical expectations and corroborate the adaptive nature of authentic living and the maladaptive tendencies of accepting external influence and self-alienation. The obtained results collectively support that the psychometric properties of the Polish adaptation of the Authenticity Scale are comparable to those of the original version. It can therefore be concluded that the Polish adaptation of the AS is a reliable tool for measuring authenticity, which—once normalisation research has been conducted or local norms calculated—can be useful in the work of clinicians, psychological counsellors, and researchers.
Household consumption or income surveys do not typically cover refugee populations. In the rare cases where refugees are included, inconsistencies between different data sources could interfere with comparable poverty estimates. We test the performance of a recently developed cross-survey imputation method to estimate poverty for a sample of refugees in Colombia, combining household income surveys collected by the Government of Colombia and administrative (ProGres) data collected by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2019 and 2022. We find that certain variable transformation methods can help resolve these inconsistencies. Estimation results with our preferred variable standardization method are robust to different imputation methods, including the normal linear regression method, the empirical distribution of the errors method, and the probit and logit methods. Several common machine learning techniques generally perform worse than our proposed imputation methods. We also find that we can reasonably impute poverty rates using an older household income survey and a more recent ProGres dataset for most of the poverty lines. These results provide relevant inputs into designing better surveys and administrative datasets on refugees in various country settings.
The concept of transnational knowledge networks has entered the field of study of environmental mobility. Yet, how these networks play a role in adaptation to environmental change remains understudied. Power dynamics and familial ties impact the functioning of transnational networks and intricately shape responses to environmental challenges, with gender serving as a salient factor. This research aims to theorize and empirically study how gender matters for how men and women engage with environmental concerns within transnational spaces of Moroccan migrants living in Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands. This study employs visual mapping techniques to uncover gendered patterns and modalities of communication within transnational networks. Findings reveal significant gender disparities in how environmental challenges are discussed and addressed within Moroccan transnational networks. While women prioritize family welfare and employ cultural practices to tackle environmental issues, men focus more on economic implications. Women’s perspectives and voices are marginalized, reflecting societal gender norms and biases that prioritize men’s voices and expertise in economic matters. This ignorance hinders their participation and access to support within transnational networks, perpetuating gender disparities in engagement and decision-making.
Multiple studies link family conflict to self-harm; however, no research has explored whether family conflict influences adolescents’ likelihood of engaging in a relatively new and destructive behavior known as digital self-harm, or the practice of anonymously posting harmful information about oneself online. Grounded in Agnew’s general strain theory, this study examined the relationship between family conflict and digital self-harm using a sample of 9,819 adolescents from the 2019 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey. Logistic regression analyses revealed that, even after accounting for various potential confounding variables, family conflict was positively associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in digital self-harm. Additionally, results from an analysis of indirect effects revealed that this relationship was largely mediated by adolescents’ depressive symptoms. The study concludes with recommendations for reducing both family conflict and digital self-harm.
Despite the multidimensional nature of poverty, its temporal dimension remains understudied in Iran. This paper uses data from the Time Use Survey (2019–2020) representing urban areas of Iran to examine the prevalence and intensity of time poverty among adult men and women. The results indicate that 16.4% of adults aged 15–64 years are time-poor, with men more likely than women to experience time poverty. Gender emerges as a significant determinant, with women considerably more likely to be time-poor than men with similar characteristics. Women’s lower participation in paid work is a major gender disparity, and its elimination could significantly increase the time pressure on women. Unlike time poverty itself, few variables predict its intensity, suggesting general homogeneity regardless of the characteristics examined. Employment increases both the likelihood and intensity of time poverty for women. This finding has significant implications for Iran, where despite nearing the end of the demographic window of economic opportunity, female labor market participation remains low.
The Sasanian Empire (224–651 CE) has been given relatively little attention in research on climate-society interactions when compared to the neighboring Byzantine Empire, despite evidence of changing conditions and an agricultural economy that is theoretically vulnerable to droughts due to low annual precipitation. We review the available historical, archaeological, paleo-environmental, and paleo-climatic evidence to assess whether climatic conditions factored into periods of Sasanian growth and decline. We find evidence for drier conditions across Sasanian territories at the turn of the sixth century, a pattern that extends to the Aegean, Anatolia, and Central Asia. These same conditions contributed to a significant decline for the nearby Kingdom of Himyar but occurred alongside a period of expansion and intensification for the Sasanian Empire. We suggest that a combination of careful management of water infrastructure, including qanats, which can conserve water resources during dry periods, and land-use strategies that are both diverse and flexible, may have mitigated the worst impacts of this dry period. However, we note several weaknesses in the available data that still hinder confident interpretations of the potential impacts of climate change in the Sasanian Empire. Notably, there are gaps in the coverage of paleo-hydrological records and a complete lack of terrestrial paleo-temperature records in the region, as well as low resolution and high chronological uncertainties in the archaeological and paleo-environmental evidence.
Deforestation and dam building together with climate change along the Lancang/Mekong have upended centuries and even millennia of biocultural management. The river and the rainforests in this part of monsoon Asia provide the livelihood for over 70 million people in Yunnan and SE Asia and are among the most important rainforest cover and carbon sinks in the world after the Amazon basin. It is a major biodiversity hotspot. The loss of local knowledge has contributed to greatly the loss of healthy ecosystems. The paper considers not only this loss but also the ways in which indigenous communities and civil society organizations are pushing back against the overpowering profit motive of the “epistemic engine” of the capitalist nation-state system.
After the German reunification in 1990, East Germany transitioned from a centrally planned economic system to a market economy. To tackle surging unemployment, upskilling through adult education was deemed essential at the time. Besides substantial mandatory training programs provided by active labor market policies,Volkshochschulen(VHS) were the most important providers of voluntary adult education. Based on newly digitized data, we estimate how VHS courses affected unemployment in a county-level analysis of East Germany between 1991 and 2002. Our identification strategy employs the decentralized expansion of courses, which led to substantial, quasi-random variation in their regional supply. We do not find any significant effects of VHS courses on subsequent unemployment. Lacking labor demand and low market dynamics may have restricted the realization of education effects. Regional disparities support this notion: In counties bordering West Germany, courses reduced unemployment. Our results hint towards multiple mechanisms at play, as both work-related and recreational courses were found to be effective in border counties.
The current study aimed to better understand which psychological problems are most impairing, as measured by quality of life and perceived parental psychopathology associations among emerging adults. Participants included 602 college-attending emerging adults who were recruited through an online participant pool at a large Southern United States university. Participants completed measures about quality of life, parental psychological problems, and personal psychological problems. Results indicated that when compared to emerging adults not at-risk for psychological problems, emerging adults at-risk for anxiety problems reported lower psychological, social, and total quality of life and higher levels of parental psychopathology across all domains. Additionally, emerging adults at-risk for anxiety problems reported better physical quality of life than emerging adults at-risk for any other psychological problem and remarkably lower parental psychopathology than emerging adults at-risk for antisocial problems and autism problems. The current study identified the most impairing self-reported psychological problems in emerging adults by assessing quality of life differences.
A growing body of literature uses country-level indicators to examine the impact of immigrants’ source-country conditions on the home and work lives of immigrants after arrival. One measure that has attracted increased attention is gender inequality in immigrants’ countries of origin. However, little is known about the degree to which the transition from high to low gender inequality countries affects the development of connections with the receiving country and whether immigrant women and men are impacted differently. This article examines the association between source-country gender inequality and immigrants’ sense of belonging to Canada. Our regression analysis of data from the 2013 and 2020 General Social Surveys suggests a higher level of source-country gender inequality is associated with a stronger sense of belonging to Canada for both immigrant men and women. Despite concerns from some conservative critics that gender inequality in source countries hinders immigrant integration, the results show that immigrants from cultures different from Canada develop a strong sense of belonging to Canada. Our findings suggest that cultural distance does not necessarily have a negative impact on immigrant men’s and women’s self-perceived integration into their host country.
It has been well established that the effectiveness and quality of political representation is unequally distributed in Western democracies. Scholars have frequently warned about the rise of ‘diploma democracies’ and a ‘new gilded age’ in which political systems are skewed towards the interests of those with a higher socio-economic status. In this paper, we investigate one possible causal mechanism of this inequality: the greater ability of educated citizens to cast a ‘correct’ vote. If some citizens are not able to accurately identify the party or candidate that best represents their interests, electoral and political participation will not lead to full representation. On the basis of the American National Election Study and original experimental data, we provide evidence that citizens’ level of education has important repercussions for their capacity for correct voting. More educated voters have higher levels of political sophistication, and they are in turn more likely to cast a correct vote. As we find that both political sophistication and information processing capability help us to explain the effect of education on correct voting, we expect that this form of stratification will remain rather persistent.
Distrust is widely argued to stimulate support for political and institutional change. Yet, there is little agreement among scholars whether distrust pulls people towards rivaling decision-making models such as direct democracy, technocracy, and authoritarianism. This paper argues that political distrust is an unconditional push-factor away from the status quo (i.e., representative democracy), but that the appeal of any specific alternative decision-making models among distrusters is conditional on their political dispositions. This paper systematically tests rivaling theories on the micro-level relationship between political distrust and support for change, representative democracy, and alternative decision-making models. Crucially, we test to what extent the pull-factor of rivaling models is conditional on citizens’ political efficacy and populist leaning. Moreover, we separate the effects of structurally low trust from that of dynamically declining trust by estimating Random Effects Within Between (REWB) models on three-wave panel survey data across four European countries (the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Portugal). Our findings confirm that distrust unconditionally pushes people away from the status quo, but does not unconditionally pull people towards any alternative model. Rather than technocracy (mixed effects) and authoritarianism (predominantly negative effects), we find that political distrust particularly stimulates support for direct democracy. This positive effect of political distrust on support for direct democracy is particularly strong among efficacious citizens and supporters of populist parties. This aligns with the idea of dissatisfied democrats, whose distrust drives their ambition for more direct influence.
Despite the importance of romantic relationships for psychological health, there is limited research exploring how communication about relationships unfolds in families during adolescence and emerging adulthood (beyond the narrower topic of sex). As such, the current research explored the nature of caregiver-child communication about relationships and assessed whether this communication is associated with young people’s psychological health. We hypothesized that young people will have fewer and lower quality conversations about relationships in comparison to other developmental goals but that communication quality would improve with age. We also hypothesized that the quality of relationships communication would predict psychological health as indexed by self-esteem and psychological distress. In a series of two survey studies, adolescents (n= 129) and emerging adults (n= 716) reported on the frequency and quality of communication about relationships (and other developmentally-relevant topics including education, career, race/ethnicity) with their primary female caregiver and reported on their own psychological health. A subset of Study 1 participants additionally completed a daily diary assessing the frequency with which they discussed these topics and/or reported on their psychological health a second time. Results showed that conversations about relationships generally occurred less frequently than other topics and were also seen as the lowest in quality across assessments, though quality did improve with age. Moreover, even when controlling for communication about other topics, the frequency and quality of relationships communication positively predicted aspects of psychological health. Results indicate that young people may benefit from interventions designed to improve family communication about relationships.
The term “complex needs” has been used to describe young people who have a range of multiple and co-occurring problems that can be caused by individual level (e.g., psychosocial needs) and broader social-economic factors (e.g., homelessness, child maltreatment, justice system involvement). Coordinating the multiple services required to support these young people and successfully engaging them in services can be challenging. The purpose of this study was to gain deeper insight into the barriers to, and strategies for, service engagement among young people who require support from multiple services. Interviews and focus groups (N = 12) were conducted with relevant government and non-government stakeholders in an Australian jurisdiction to obtain qualitative insights into barriers and strategies for effective service engagement. Thematic analysis identified 20 principal themes that were differentiated into two overarching categories relating to service engagement: 1) Barriers, and 2) Strategies, and across three levels: 1) Systems; 2) Services; and 3) Individuals. Many of the strategies to facilitate engagement were applicable across all three levels. For example, ‘flexibility’ was identified as a facilitator of service engagement from the individual practitioner level to broader service and system structures. This study highlights barriers that need to be overcome, and strategies that can be employed, to facilitate engagement between services and young people who have complex needs. There is a need to create a service environment that is adaptive to the needs of young people rather than one which requires these young people to adapt to any particular service.
Assessments of resilience and sustainability are increasingly important for mitigating the effects of climate change, especially in rural areas such as the Southern Great Plains (SGP) in the United States. While ecological and economic research on rural sustainability is necessary, we argue that a social approach is essential to understanding how to promote resilient futures. Social capital facilitates access to, and transference of resources individuals need to achieve individual and collective ends. Over the past three decades, research on social capital has advanced across multiple disciplines to address a variety of social phenomena, issues, and outcomes. Building on previous research in the SGP, we focus on community-level social capital through a qualitative content analysis of 65 key informant interviews across the three counties in Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Colorado. Findings suggest that while in-group social capital is strong, resistance to outsiders and government distrust create significant barriers to promoting more resilient communities. Our study contributes to a prolific body of literature on rural sustainability and disaster mitigation. It also develops important insights into the dynamic, contingent, and interdependent nature of social capital. We conclude with recommendations on how to promote community agency while cultivating collaborative relationships between rural communities and government institutions in the interest of rural resilience.
The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to college students, with students who are parents at risk for amplified difficulties due to the dual responsibilities of parenting and pursuing higher education, but there are few studies that compare the experiences of student parents with non-parenting college students. This study employed a quantitative, cross-sectional approach to compare the needs, concerns, and resources of student parents (n= 167) to those of non-parent students (n= 617) at a mid-sized public university in the Gulf South. Data were collected during the Spring 2021 semester using theHigher Education Student and Student Parent Survey(HESSPS). Overall, a greater proportion of student-parents reported resource awareness, receiving social support, and positive experiences with the pandemic compared to non-parent students; significantly more non-parent students reported financial insecurity, academic difficulties, psychosocial and emotional health issues, and negative pandemic-related experiences. However, when the two groups were divided by age (<25 vs >=25 years), older student parents retained the highest proportion reporting social support and positive pandemic experiences and also had lowest proportion reporting academic difficulties. In contrast, young student parents had the greatest proportion reporting academic difficulties and financial and housing insecurity. Recognizing the heterogeneity of student parents, including their strengths in times of crisis, is critical for addressing equity gaps in higher education and for informing targeted policies and resources so these under-recognized students can accomplish their educational and family goals.
This study investigates parental concerns about the safety of children en route to school in the Western Cape, South Africa, through a survey conducted across nineteen school locations in high- and low-pedestrian crash areas. The density of crash locations closely correlated with low- and higher-income areas. The research reveals a high level of concern among parents in both types of areas, with significantly greater worry prevalent in lower-income neighbourhoods. Although the mode of transportation varied between the two groups, both expressed concerns about their children’s journeys. Notably, these concerns extended beyond traffic safety to include personal security issues related to criminal activity in the neighbourhood. Compared to international studies, parents in this study were more worried about speeding and drunk drivers than general traffic conditions. The study also highlights a stark reality: many parents, especially in lower-income areas, are unable to change their children’s commuting conditions despite their high levels of concern, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. This research emphasises the importance of incorporating parental perspectives in developing strategies to enhance child pedestrian safety.
Over the past century, numerous studies have examined Jean Piaget’s relationship with psychoanalysis. Until the 1970s, they often emphasized the value of a rapprochement between Piaget and Freud and highlighted the use of Piaget’s ideas in therapeutic practice. Then from the 1980s onwards, several studies focused on the relationship between his work–seen as purely cognitive, to the exclusion of the social and the affective–and his conflicted relationship with his mother. Based on similar sources, particularly his autobiography, these studies led to a reductionist account of his work according to which intellectual content was determined as much by the conflictual relationship as by his alleged autism. The article begins by deconstructing these ideas, showing that in the 1920s Piaget gave an important place to affectivity and the role of the mother in development. It then analyses the Piaget’s family dynamics of the 1919–1920 period, focusing on the family system–Jean’s parents, sisters and brother-in-law–in its relationship to pathology, a dynamic reconstructed with the help of correspondences. The article presents a series of totally unknown episodes in Piaget’s life. It shows that this was an enmeshed family system Minuchin (Families and family therapy, 1974) in which members were both highly involved and dependent on the mother. Within it, Piaget was designated as atherapist, for both the mother and the system, thus reversing standard roles and the classic figure of the designated patient. This research strengthened the few works that have identified either Piaget’s position as a therapist or the importance of his ideas for psychotherapy.
The Ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) sector is religiously conservative, insular, strictly adheres to Judaism, and considers raising children a central value. This study broadens the research on this sector by examining how conservativeness, parental identity, and parenting behaviors predict parental well-being. Parenting behaviors were assessed by the Parenting Pentagon Model (PPM), which includes five constructs that provide a comprehensive picture of parenting:Partnership,Leadership,Love, Independence, andRules. Participants were 355 Haredi parents (279 mothers, 76 fathers), who completed questionnaires addressing primary study variables. The parents reported being more conservative than open, having a fairly strong parental identity, more optimal behaviors on the PPM, and fairly high levels of well-being. A regression analysis showed that having a child with a disability, conservativeness, parental identity, and the PPM all explained significant variance in parental well-being. A greater understanding of this sector can lend insight into other insular, conservative sectors around the world.
Ethnographic studies have attempted to uncover the various lived experiences of differentially vulnerable communities across populations and regions globally. To analyze emerging themes and draw new insights into differential vulnerability to climate change in caste-based South Asian societies, particularly in Nepal and India, we conducted a meta-ethnographic systematic review study. We systematically selected 17 articles, analyzed the data, and identified six themes from 14 sub-themes, linking them with caste-based differential vulnerability to climate change through relevant examples, immediate effects, and seven long-term impacts. Our insights into caste-based differential vulnerability align with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vulnerability framework (exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity), and we present them diagrammatically to enhance clarity and accessibility. The review highlights the significant effects of the caste system on shaping climate change vulnerability in caste-based societies. We recommend conducting in-depth empirical research on caste-based disproportionate social vulnerability to climate change, taking our new synthesis to test it as a hypothesis.
I employ a conceptual synthesis that bridges Western and First Nations sciences in pursuit of a broader understanding of cultural burning as a multispecies practice in Australia. The concept of ‘re-storying’ diminishes nature/culture dualisms and creates space for the role of culture in understanding and shaping ecologies; the concept of ‘niche construction’ fosters attention to the ways in which humans co-construct landscapes with other organisms in ways that affect the communities doing the co-constructing. With this conceptual toolkit, I draw attention to the species that play important roles in cultural burning practices through story, ceremony, and their actions upon the landscape. Animals such as bandicoots, brush turkeys, and raptors have pronounced effects on landscapes, and these in turn alter and affect the ways in which First Nations peoples apply fire. These stories demonstrate the complex, relational, and multispecies nature of cultural burning and the need for broader, more nuanced approaches that allow people to burn for, and with, animals.
Global evidence indicates minimal connection between immigration and crime. Nordic research, however, has been generally carried out on individuals and shows that immigrants are over-represented in crime. This has led to claims that high crime rates are due to immigration. We directed our study towards these claims by analyzing immigrant population prevalence, defined as the percent of foreign-born individuals, and violent crime in Swedish municipalities between 2000 and 2020. Nearly all municipalities had higher violent crime rates in 2020 relative to 2000. To discern whether drastic increases in municipality-level crime rates could be connected to municipality-level immigrant population prevalence, a retrospective case–control design was used to select 20 municipalities with the highest increase in reported violent crime rates and 20 municipalities with the lowest increase in reported violent crime rates. Immigrant population prevalence had little association with high rates of reported violent crime. The average association between immigrant population prevalence and violent crime rates calculated from all municipalities was also weak and non-significant (p> 0.05). Municipalities with a high increase in crime tended to have more crime correlates than municipalities with a low increase in crime. However, more research is needed on the impact of migration in small towns, especially those that have experienced economic and social stagnation.
ObjectivesTo test the effect of local, industry-specific labour demand on employment and recidivism following a person’s release from a prison in Finland.MethodsThis study was an observational study based on administrative data. The data included all working-aged men (N= 33,270) released from prison between 2007 and 2018 in Finland. We analysed the industry of the employers descriptively and studied the effect of labour demand on employment and recidivism rates post-release with a linear probability model. Labour demand was measured by counting new employments that began in the first 30 days post-release in the region the subject resided in at the time of release. Employment and recidivism were analysed with a 6- and 12-month follow-up.ResultsOf the study population, 11.1% were employed and 44.7% recidivated in the first 6 months. We found the most common employers to be the construction and manufacturing industries along with temporary work agencies. Our models indicated that the low-skill labour demand in construction increased the likelihood of employment (β = 0.0108, se = 0.0026) but did not reduce the risk of recidivism (β = 0.0030, se = 0.0045).ConclusionsHigher labour demand may not lead to lower recidivism in all contexts. As the effect of labour demand may be driven by specific societal or labour market characteristics, further research should focus on identifying the characteristics that affect recidivism and post-prison employment. As this study may only be generalisable to the Finnish prison population, similar studies are needed from varied contexts.
The reason why people endorse belief in a just world (BJW), in which each person gets what he deserves and deserves what he gets, is mainly attributed to motivational processes. BJW is also an inter-individual difference, and cognitive preference for less reflective and more intuitive thinking may be a complementary explanation of why people endorse this explicit version of BJW. In a preregistered and highly powered study (N= 46,815), we investigated and showed for the first time a relationship between individuals’ scores on a cognitive performance task and BJW, when controlling for relevant demographics. Our result showed that individuals with a less reflective orientation were more likely to endorse explicit just world beliefs. This is consistent with previous studies based on cognitive reflection test showing that individuals with a lower preference for logical rationality endorsed simplifying worldviews. Our results illustrate that individual differences in cognitive style may produce preferences for specific justice beliefs.
Gender inequalities are pervasive across various life domains, yet research has often overlooked how people perceive that women are treated differently than men. To fill this gap, we developed and validated the 16-item multidimensional Social Treatment and Experiences of Women (STEW) scale across different samples of women and different cultural contexts, namely Italy and the UKN= 1,195). Using exploratory (Study 1,N =703) and confirmatory (Study 2,N =550; Study 3a,N =132; Study 4,N= 201; Study 5,N= 233) factor analysis, we identified four dimensions: workplace inequalities, domestic imbalance, harassment towards women, and social expectations. Studies 3a and 3b (N =96) demonstrated convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of the STEW, linking the STEW’s subscales to group-based emotions, reported experiences of sexism, attitudes towards affirmative action, and attitudes towards women’s sexual freedom. Replicating the factor structure in the UK, Study 4 found the STEW explained unique variance in group-based emotions and intergroup attitudes beyond personal experiences of sexism. Last, Study 5 showed that the STEW explains unique variance in collective action intentions and feminist identification beyond people’s attitudes towards gender equality. Highlighting the importance of conceiving gender inequalities as a multifaceted issue, the STEW provides a robust tool for assessing perceptions of differential treatment of women across domains and can inform more comprehensive interventions promoting gender equality.
Smartphones can extend the reach of evidence-based gambling treatment services, yet the general acceptability of app-delivered gambling interventions remains unknown. This study examined the general acceptability and use of app-delivered gambling interventions, and predictors of both, among 173 Australian adults with a lifetime gambling problem (48.5% male, Mage= 46.4 years) recruited from an online panel. Overall, 55.5% of the sample had a positive attitude toward app-delivered gambling interventions, 8.1% had a neutral attitude, and 36.4% had a negative attitude. Furthermore, one in five participants (20.8%) reported using an app-delivered gambling intervention in their lifetime. Four dimensions of acceptability were examined, wherein 78.6% of participants endorsed confidence in the effectiveness of app-delivered gambling interventions and 66.5% perceived anonymity benefits, while 48.6% endorsed scepticism (e.g., potential to increase isolation) and 69.4% perceived technology-related threats (e.g., difficulty learning and applying app-based strategies). Positive predictors of acceptability and use included younger age, rural/regional residence, gambling expenditure, problem gambling severity, gambling harms, and use of professional support. Acceptability did not increase the likelihood of using app-delivered gambling interventions, however, which may suggest a translation gap. The findings support continued investment into the development and evaluation of app-delivered gambling interventions, with a focus on enhancing engagement and uptake. Uptake could be improved by promoting the effectiveness and anonymity of evidence-based app-delivered gambling interventions, particularly among receptive audiences (young people, rural/regional residents, those with greater problem gambling severity), while redressing scepticism and perceived technology-related threats among vulnerable subgroups (those with greater gambling expenditure and gambling-related harm).
Executive function skills are critical in early development, as they “form the foundation for children’s ability to self-regulate” (McLelland, et al., 2016, p. 242). Inhibitory control, one component of executive function, is the ability to suppress or inhibit responses to distractions when completing a task. The purpose of this study was to improve children’s inhibitory control in the classroom through ageappropriate games, which promote controlling emotions and remaining on task. Three target children were observed in the classroom they attended with their regular teacher. Baseline data revealed that the target children needed improvement on inhibitory control skills, which included controlling emotions and staying on task. The Inhibitory Control Intervention consisted of age-appropriate games (Uno, Perfection, Matching Cards, I Spy book) that promoted staying on task and controlling emotions independently and with small groups of peers. Data were collected using momentary time sampling for a ten minute period during free choice center time. When the Inhibitory Control Intervention was in place, there was an increase in both on task behavior and controlling emotions during free-choice center time. Providing opportunities for children to practice inhibitory control skills can be beneficial for increasing children’s self-regulation skills.
The incorporation of digital technologies in hotels worldwide is moving forward at the same pace as the recovery of the tourism sector itself following the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers have looked at this topic from the perspective of suppliers and consumers, but little research has been carried out on hotels’ internal digitalisation processes and understanding their technological priorities to become more competitive. Atomization of hotel business structure and its characteristics and composition have traditionally hindered data collection. This research addresses this gap through close collaboration with the regional associative structure. The initial hypothesis is that digitization in Andalusian hotels flows at different speeds. The aim of the present study is to establish both the current state and the speed of digital transformation in hotels. To this end, there is an analysis of the degree of implementation of digital technologies in the hotel sector based on a case study of Andalusia (Spain). A mixed method approach is used, combining two focus groups that together contain 14 stakeholders, with 183 technological implementation surveys sent to hotels. This approach allows differentiation between the values of hotels specifically and those of accommodation as a whole, using two blocks of questions: technological solutions and tools; and infrastructures, integrations and data analysis. The results allow the validation of the initial hypothesis and show digital transition at two different speeds. The solutions and tools implemented, the technological priorities of future implementation and the use of digital enablers each display very disparate realities. Accelerating the rhythm of digitalisation is a great challenge for all hotels, whatever their category. The study contributes an original theoretical-practical model, whose method can be applied to other tourist destinations, regardless of their nationality. It enables comparisons and measurements, addressing both the typology of technological tools and solutions, and digitalisation issues.
This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the statistical disclosure limitation (SDL) methodologies employed by the U.S. Census Bureau on the 2010 and 2020 Decennial Census releases under the perspective of the disclosure risk of the most vulnerable respondents. We first review the SDL methodology used up to the Decennial Census 2010, which was based on targeted swapping. Second, we examine recently reported reconstruction and reidentification results on the Decennial Census 2010 outputs, which form the foundation for the U.S. Census Bureau’s decision to switch to a differentially private (DP) method for the 2020 release. Third, we examine the actual privacy and data accuracy achieved by the DP method and compare with the privacy and accuracy offered by the formerly employed swapping mechanism. We conclude that the DP method is not an adequate solution to protect the typically sparse tables present in the Decennial Censuses because it does not offer meaningful privacy guarantees in general, it poorly protects the privacy of the most vulnerable respondents in particular, and it significantly degrades the quality of the released data. We also argue that the claimed disclosure risks of previous Census releases were overstated because of a flawed reidentification procedure. Therefore, the U.S. Census Bureau’s decision to change the SDL methodology to a DP-based one for the 2020 release was not only unwarranted, but it also reduced privacy and data quality compared to former releases.
This volume makes a notable contribution with a deep and extensive analysis to achieve the movement from Yoga Philosophy to Yoga Psychology for the promotion of integration with Modern Psychology, a task hitherto unrealized despite the burgeoning attention to Yoga. This commentary is constrained by my own limited knowledge of traditional Indian philosophy in making a thorough examination of Paranjpe’s contribution beyond attention to selected concepts and sporadic illustrations from the original volume. Yoga practice is, Paranjpe informs us, just the tip of an immense consolidation of knowledge, deep intellectual thought and theoretical consideration about the embodied sense of self, health and well-being. Spirituality is foundational to the theory and practice of yoga. This volume has immense potential relevance for contemporary psychological theory and practice in an attempt to highlight embodied and spiritual considerations of human existence. With some notable exceptions, modern psychology has adopted the positivistic paradigm that systematically rejects traditional knowledge systems. Through intercultural translation (a concept I borrow from Santos,2018), Paranjpe successfully transcends this divide and provides detailed possibilities about why and how this knowledge can relate to, inform and expand the science of human being and becoming that is inclusive, built for mutuality rather than domination; travelling on the path of dialogue between diverse knowledge systems.
The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected those with caregiving responsibilities and its impacts continue. Through the fall of 2022, the circulation of RSV, influenza, and COVID-19 – a “tripledemic” – placed parents and caregivers in precarious situations with few COVID-19 supports available and less flexibility in work arrangements, potentially increasing family-to-work conflict (FWC). This mixed-methods study incorporates online survey data from the January 2023 Alberta Viewpoint Survey (N= 1196) and interview data collected from May-August 2023 (N= 23) to study the strategies families and caregivers used during the tripledemic to manage FWC in a time of high uncertainty. We find that parents, especially mothers, were most likely to miss work for extended periods, leading to a greater potential for FWC among these groups. Parents’ ability to manage FWC depended on the resources available to them, which were highly unequal. Those who were able to take advantage of workplace, relationship, and network resources were better able to limit FWC during these uncertain times. Findings contribute to larger understandings of family-to-work conflict by highlighting how parents attempt to manage uncertainty and the inequalities in available resources.
This article aims to reconceptualize the replication crisis as not merely a problem of flawed methods, lack of scientific rigor, or questionable researcher conduct, but as a fundamentally epistemological and philosophical issue. While improved methodologies and scientific practices are necessary, they must be considered through the lens of the underlying epistemologies. Toward this end, a new paradigm for psychological research and practice, grounded in second-order cybernetics and transactional causality, is proposed as instrumental. Second-order cybernetics, as introduced by Heinz von Foerster, challenges traditional scientific methodologies that assume a strict separation between the observer and the observed. The core idea is that the observer, through the very act of observing, inevitably becomes part of the system they study, leading to a shift from linear to transactional causality. This epistemological shift has profound implications for the research practice and the responsibility of the psychology practitioner. Foerster’s ethical imperative –act always so as to increase the number of choices– combined with the aesthetic imperative –If you desire to see,learn how to act– illuminates an alternative methodological landscape for the clinical practice. The replication crisis in psychology is examined in light of these theoretical shifts, allowing for a new constructive vision which integrates basic research with applied psychological practice. Second-order cybernetics encourages a participatory approach to research, emphasizing the catalyzing role of the observing practitioner. The article concludes by advocating for an epistemological superposition, where psychologists navigate multiple perspectives to enhance the integrity and applicability of their findings in the real world.
Several countries, including Canada and Australia, have developed public health-based lower-risk gambling limits to differentiate lower-risk from higher-risk gambling. This study aimed to identify a preliminary set of lower-risk gambling limits (gambling frequency, duration, expenditure, expenditure as a proportion of personal net income, and diversity), and investigate if gambling types are linked to additional harms, in a Swedish context. The study involved secondary analyses of two online survey studies using the Gambling Disorder Identification Test (GDIT). Receiver operating curve analyses were conducted in relation to both + 1 and + 2 gambling-related harms in a sample of 705 past-year gamblers. Potential lower-risk limits ranges identified were: gambling frequency of “2–3 times a week” to “4 or more times a week” (8–16 times monthly); gambling duration of 6 to 15 h per month; gambling expenditure of 2,000 SEK (approximately $USD190) per month; gambling expenditure as a proportion of personal net income of 5%; and gambling diversity of only one problematic gambling type. Gambling on slots and sports betting were associated with gambling-related harms. The lower-risk limits in the current study were higher than in previous studies, which may be explained by the large proportion of support- or treatment-seeking gamblers with high rates of problem gambling and problematic online gambling in the study sample. An international consensus-based framework on gambling consumption is warranted, with lower-risk limits validated in future empirical studies using larger datasets collected from the Swedish general population.
PurposePatient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) are widely used in clinical trials, epidemiological research, quality of life (QOL) studies, routine clinical care, and medical surveillance. The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a system of reliable and standardized measures of PROs developed with Item Response Theory (IRT) using latent scores. Power estimation is critical to clinical trials and research designs. However, in clinical trials with PROs as endpoints, observed scores are often used to calculate power rather than latent scores.MethodsIn this paper, we conducted a series of simulations to compare the power obtained with IRT latent scores, including Bayesian IRT, Frequentist IRT, and observed scores, focusing on small sample size common in pilot studies and Phase I/II trials. Taking the PROMIS depression measures as an example, we simulated data and estimated power for two-armed clinical trials manipulating the following factors: sample size, effect size, and number of items. We also examined how misspecification of effect size affected power estimation.ResultsOur results showed that the Bayesian IRT, which incorporated prior information into latent score estimation, yielded the highest power, especially when sample size was small. The effect of misspecification diminished as sample size increased.ConclusionFor power estimation in two-armed clinical trials with standardized PRO endpoints, if a medium effect size or larger is expected, we recommend BIRT simulation with well-grounded informative priors and a total sample size of at least 40.
PurposePrior evidence suggests that patients’ Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) worsens after COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate HRQoL in Italian patients post-hospitalization for COVID-19, focusing on changes in physical and mental HRQoL over time since COVID-19 diagnosis.MethodsA cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at Molinette Hospital in Turin, Italy, was contacted post-discharge to assess HRQoL using the SF-36 questionnaire. Patients completed the questionnaire only once at a different time since diagnosis. This design allowed for the analysis of responses up to three years after diagnosis. Measured scores were compared with normative data from the Italian population using z-scores. HRQoL differences by gender, comorbidities, and self-perception of health status before and after COVID-19 were tested. The effect of time since diagnosis on physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) SF-36 scores was analysed using multiple linear models and stratified analyses.ResultsA total of 601 patients completed the questionnaire. HRQoL was significantly lower compared to the normative Italian population. Men and individuals without comorbidities had better HRQoL, and self-perceptions of health status before and after COVID-19 influenced HRQoL. Time since diagnosis was associated with improved PCS, but MCS remained unaffected. Mental health declined in patients using anxiolytics post-COVID-19, and increasing age negatively affected physical health.ConclusionOur findings highlight the impact of time since diagnosis on HRQoL post-COVID-19 in an Italian population and suggest the need for further investigation into the pandemic’s effects on HRQoL. Physicians should implement measures to improve mental HRQoL post-COVID-19.
Despite ample research on the association between working time mismatch and work-life outcomes from an individual perspective, little has explored the dyadic correlation from a couple-level perspective among working parents. Using fixed effects models and longitudinal dyadic data from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, this study examines the influence of working time mismatch of husbands and wives on their own and each other’s work-life outcomes (e.g., work-life enrichment, work-life conflict), thereby shedding light on crossover effects in work-life dynamics among working parents. The study reveals that overemployment is significantly associated with worse work-life outcomes for both mothers and fathers. Additionally, noticeable gender differences in spousal effects are observed: mothers’ overemployment significantly worsens their husbands’ work-life outcomes, and their underemployment notably improves it. In contrast, fathers’ working time mismatch does not significantly affect their wives’ work-life outcomes. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the negative effects of overemployment on both personal and spousal work-life outcomes persist, even for those with high job autonomy. Overall, this study underscores the dyadic association between couples’ working time mismatch and work-life outcomes among working parents, delineating an asymmetric dynamic. These findings suggest that policies aimed at reducing overemployment, addressing gender-specific challenges, and supporting flexible work arrangements are crucial for improving employee well-being in dual-earner households.
Parental Reflective Functioning is considered a critical variable, both for the exercise of parenthood and for child development. For some years now, there has been a need for sufficiently sensitive and effective instruments to explore and evaluate Parental Reflective Functioning. This preliminary study presents the construction and validation of a short version of theParent Development Interview-Revised, which we callParent Development Interview-Brief.The main objective of this abbreviation is to maintain the semi-structured nature of the interview while decreasing the time needed to administer it. A multicenter and cross-sectional study with a normative sample of 60 mothers of children under five years of age with normotypical development is presented. To analyze the criterion validity of theParent Development Interview-Brief, participants completed theCuestionario de Apego Adulto [Adult Attachment Questionnaire]and theParenting Stress Index-Short Form.The psychometric qualities of the new instrument are discussed, as well as the need for sufficiently sensitive, reliable, and effective tools to tap Parental Reflective Functioning for use in clinical contexts and research.
Healthcare professionals play a crucial role in healthcare systems, but their demanding work significantly impacts their mental and physical health, affecting patient care. This study investigates the interplay of work environment, doctor-patient relationships, media influence, and self-reported health among healthcare professionals. This study employed a stratified sampling approach to survey 8386 healthcare professionals from 40 hospitals across 8 provinces in China. Gaussian Graphical Modeling was used to analyze factors impacting well-being, including physical and mental health, work environment, doctor-patient relationship, and media influence. Network visualization identified key nodes, and the accuracy and stability of the network were assessed. The work environment emerged as a critical bridging factor in the interconnected network. Strong correlations were observed within the work environment cluster, covering aspects related to career, financial, and working conditions. Mental health issues like anxiety and depression also demonstrated moderate co-occurrence. Centrality analysis further identified key nodes associated with job satisfaction, physical fatigue, and mental health symptoms. Work environment plays a central factor interconnecting healthcare professionals' mental health, physical health, doctor-patient relationships, and media influence. Key insights include strong correlations within the work environment cluster, co-occurrence of mental health issues, and the close relationship between physical and psychological well-being. Addressing workplace stressors, fostering positive doctor-patient relationships, and mitigating negative media portrayals can contribute to a healthier environment for healthcare professionals. Comprehensive programs addressing both mental and physical health needs, including mental health screenings, stress management techniques, and promoting physical activity, are crucial.
Amid societal transformation and digitalization, the issue of short video addiction among the elderly has emerged as a critical social concern. Previous studies have shown that parental phubbing is positively correlated with adolescent short video addiction. However, little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms behind the relationship between adult offspring’s phubbing behavior and parental short video addiction. This study, grounded in interpersonal acceptance-rejection theory, investigates the direct relationship between adult offspring’s phubbing behavior and short video addiction in the elderly. It proposes a model where loneliness mediates and neuroticism moderates this relationship. A survey encompassing 684 elderly individuals (aged 55 to 83) from Sichuan-Chongqing region of China was conducted, assessing phubbing behaviors, short video addiction, loneliness, and neuroticism. The findings reveal that adult offspring’s phubbing positively predicts short video addiction in the elderly, with loneliness partially mediating this relationship. Furthermore, the level of neuroticism in the elderly modulates the link between loneliness and addiction. Specifically, individuals with high neuroticism exhibit greater addiction under low loneliness, while no significant addiction differences are observed under high loneliness. These results affirm the connection between offspring phubbing and elderly short video addiction, offering insights into problematic smartphone use among the elderly from an intergenerational perspective and guiding future prevention and intervention strategies for short video addiction.
Many studies indicate that Total fertility rates (TFR(t)) are negatively correlated with life expectancies at birth (e0(t)). We found that complete random-combinations of TFR(t) and e0(t) would result in about 24% and 22.2% of improbable combinations in probabilistic population projections (PPPs) for developing and developed countries, respectively, namely, high (or low) TFR(t) combined with high (or low) female e0(t). Thus, we propose optimized random-combinations of probabilistically projected TFR(t) and e0(t) for PPPs, and we use different strategies of the optimized randomcombinations across developing and developed countries due to different empirical patterns observed. As illustrative applications, we conducted PPPs for 11 developing countries (Brazil, China, Indonesia, Madagascar, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Viet Nam), and 6 developed countries (Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States), using our proposed optimized random-combinations of probabilistically projected TFR(t) and e0(t). We found that optimized random-combinations largely reduce percentages of improbable combinations of TFR(t) and e0(t) and substantially narrow the prediction intervals width compared to complete random-combinations in both developing countries and developed countries. This is important in a real-world practical sense since it would substantially improve the accuracy of PPPs, which are useful for socioeconomic planning. The present study is part of our ongoing research program on probabilistic households and living arrangement projections (PHPs) that builds upon and is consistent with the UNPD PPPs. The PHPs are useful for various studies of healthy aging and sustainable development.
In Brazil, a developing country with rich biological and cultural diversity, several species of plants and animals are used to treat diseases. We conducted a systematic review on the use of medicinal animals and plants and identify whether there are correlations between sociodemographic variables and the use of animal species and medicinal plants. We used the databases Web of Science, Science Direct, Scielo, Scopus, and PubMed to obtain 29,147 titles, including 41 studies of 47 communities between 2006 and 2015. We used the human development index, sanitary sewage, number of health establishments, and number of residents per municipality to investigate potential correlations with the number of animal and plant species (native and exotic for both taxa). The most frequently cited of the 147 families of plants identified as used in traditional medicine were: Lamiaceae, Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, and Rutaceae. The most frequently cited of the 68 families of animals mentioned were: Phasianidae, Teiidae, Bovidae, Iguanidae and Apidae. Among sociodemographic variables, only the number of residents per household showed a significant correlation with exotic animal species, although other variables showed relationship trends. Traditional medicine in Brazil plays an important role in knowledge about these natural resources, enabling alternatives to mitigate potentially negative impacts that local sociodemographic factors have on the health of human communities.
The present study aims to investigate the impacts of father-child communication on the mental health of left-behind children (LBC), and the role of maternal migration and mother-child communication in this correlations. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Anhui, China, from April 2018 to March 2019. Among 5253 valid responses, 1599 LBC who self-reported that their fathers were migrants at the time of the survey were included in the present study. There are three major findings: first, maternal migration can negatively influence LBC’s father-child communication frequency and quality; second, both higher father-child communication frequency and quality can promote LBC’s mental health; third, mother-child communication can enhance the protective effects of father-child communication quality on LBC’s mental health. Thus, we propose that, to promote the mental health of children with both parents migrating, it is of great importance for mothers and fathers to realize that direct father-child communication matters. And more direct father-child communication should be encouraged for children with both parents migrating.
This article contributes to the existing literature on attractiveness and impact tools, by developing and validating a tool for measuring territorial capital based on the beliefs and perceptions of target populations, in this case young people. The tool was developed from 26 items selected through 5 non-directive interviews and 20 semi-structured interviews, enriched by a literature review. The results of psychometric tests (exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis), based on a survey of 400 young people living in rural area of Cameroon, led to the selection of a factor structure with 18 items corresponding to 6 components of perceived territorial capital. These are social and cultural capital, anthropic capital, institutional capital, environmental capital, cognitive capital, and economic capital. This research can be a valuable aid in enhancing the effectiveness of policies aimed at improving rural attractiveness.
This short historical note dates the earliest ethnomedical reference to koro back to the 1840s (about a half-century earlier than universally presumed), and the earliest ethnopsychiatric reference to 1883 (over a decade earlier than universally presumed)
The brightness and distribution of anthropogenic illumination at night can indirectly reveal the economic prosperity and development level in human settlement areas. Nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing can be used for statistics, intuitively and timely grasping the dynamic development of the region, without being limited by actual statistical time and administrative regions. Regional socio-economic development index (RDI) comprehensively considering society, economy, healthcare, education, and transportation factors was constructed in this paper. On this basis, the LJ-1 01 remote sensing image with high spatial resolution was used to explore its potential in estimating the RDI for fine-grained scale (at county and township levels). Subsequently, Zipf’s law was conducted to evaluate balance and distribution of regional development at the county and township levels for Yunnan Province, China in 2018.The results indicate that at the county-level spatial scale, the RDI estimation model constructed using the NTL data in this paper demonstrates relatively high stability for both the third-degree polynomial function (R2= 0.7775,RMSE= 0.0677) and the power function (R2= 0.762,RMSE= 0.0731). Then at the township-level spatial scale, the power function estimation performs the best, with anR2reaching 0.6664. The power function is optimal for evaluating socio-economic development at fine-grained spatial scales. Furthermore, Yunnan Province exhibits relatively balanced development at the county level with a better performance of Zip’s value (q= 0.7851), nevertheless unbalanced development at the township level (q= 1.2421). Regions with imbalanced socio-economic development (lower RDI and highqvalues) are mainly located in areas with complex terrain and inconvenient transportation. This study can enrich the understanding of socio-economic regional development, narrowing regional disparities and achieving high-quality and sustainable development for future growth.
Disasters create and intensify stress for communities, with many factors contributing to how that stress results in mental health outcomes. Guided by the stress process model, this article presents findings from a qualitative investigation of the meaning of stress among community leaders in the context of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six community leaders in Flint and analyzed using grounded theory techniques. Secondary stressors such as necessary changes to everyday routines, being discredited by government officials, and perceptions of a lack of government action and accountability were perceived to impact the community’s mental health, with potentially more influence than the impact of the primary stressor of contaminated water. Findings indicate that both stressors and coping resources evolve with profound intrapersonal impact, such that proposed social coping resources become stressors when they do not meet individual or community needs or expectations.
Depression is among the most prevalent mental health issues affecting adolescents. Parents may play an important role in identifying warning signs of depression and providing support. However, little is known about how parents understand and respond to the early signs of adolescent depression, or their depression literacy (DL). The factors associated with their DL are also unclear. This questionnaire-based study aimed to explore DL in a sample of primary caregivers (n= 321,Mage= 46.2 years, 76% female) of 12–18-year-old adolescents living in the Republic of Ireland, through responses to a vignette depicting a character displaying symptoms of depression. Two-thirds (66.7%) attributed the character’s symptoms to depression, while 92.2% believed the character needed help. One third (34.6%) believed asking the adolescent about suicide would be harmful. Only parent empathy significantly predicted labelling the symptoms as ‘depression’. Contrary to hypotheses, there were no significant differences identified based on parents’ gender, their child’s gender, or their child’s age. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the link between empathy and DL in parents, and may inform targeted interventions to improve DL.
With corporate litigation has gradually become one of the remarkable corporate risks and development constraints for Chinese firms, there is an increasing need for an empirical study that examine the impact of corporate litigation on CEO accountability. To address this need, this study uses bivariate logit estimations for panel data of 3746 Chinese publicly listed firms during 2009–2020 to demonstrate that corporate litigation is significantly associated with increased CEO turnover and compensation reduction. It further investigates the baseline effects across firm performance, pay disparity and ownership structure which present stronger effects for poor performers and private-owned firms, yet high pay disparity correlates with a greater likelihood of compensation reduction whereas low pay disparity is associated with a higher likelihood of CEO turnover. Moreover, while securities lawsuits increase CEO turnover probability, non-securities lawsuits could lead to either CEO turnover or CEO pay cut. This study is the first to investigate the impact of corporate litigation on CEO accountability in China. The evidence supports the idea that top executives should be held accountable when firms encounter corporate litigation.
The Family First Prevention Services Act requires youth’s placement in residential care to be clinically appropriate, time-limited, and only when youth’s needs cannot be met in family-like settings in foster care. State child welfare agencies can benefit from upstream, empirical decision support to preempt youth’s placement disruption, coordinate proactive placement stabilization services, prevent unnecessary step-up to residential care, and improve outcomes for the youth. This statewide case study explores the potential benefit to child welfare decision support for placement stabilization and diversion from residential care, by comparing predictive machine learning (ML) models with conventional regression models. We analyzed child welfare spells of 12,621 youth in one large Midwestern state between January 2017 and January 2020. Caseworkers could refer youth to a placement stabilization and preservation program. To predict youth’s monthly program need in the next 6 months, we developed and validated a wide grid of ML models—random forest, regularized logistic regression, decision tree, dummy classifier—and a conventional unregularized logistic regression model, using literature-informed predictors from child welfare administrative data. We retrained, retested, and compared all models over time using temporal hold-out sets. Based on anticipated program capacity, model evaluation focused on accuracy in identifying the 100 highest-need youth, fairness, and equity of resource allocation. Random forest models produced the best performance with a precision (positive predictive value) 10 times greater than baseline precision. Common important predictors across models included youth’s age, history of placement changes, and emotional/behavioral needs. We discuss potential applications of ML to support preventive child welfare decisions, adapt to policy changes, and allocate limited resources.
Following the field of insertion into the labor market, we tested the classic hypothesis of the strength of weak ties in the three largest cities in the Southeast Region of Brazil, with a focus on communities of religious worship. A survey was carried out in 2021 with 900 questionnaires divided equally among the three cities, weighted considering the size of the population and the distribution of religious affiliation. We investigated: (1) whether the strength of ties leverages the labor insertion of adults; (2) whether religious cult communities operate as mechanisms for the circulation of opportunities in the labor market. The data were analyzed with Heckman’s two-stage correction models to mitigate possible censoring biases. Controlling by seniority in the position and participation of three sampled cities in gross national product, inter alia, the results show that strong ties, as predicted by the strength of ties theory, are associated with lower earnings. At the same time, obtaining a paid job through another cult member is negatively associated with earnings. However, when testing our main hypothesis, we found that in the three largest cities in the Southeast Region of Brazil the religious embeddedness, composed of strong ties, high worship attendance and religious motivations coming from maternal ties, operate plausibly in labor market as favorable screen mechanism associated with higher earnings.
Teacher-child shared-book reading is an everyday activity that promotes preschoolers’ oral language and reading development. Previous studies have investigated various facets of teachers’ questioning techniques. Little research, however, has focused on text-based questions (TQ) and life-experience-based questions (LQ) and how they are associated with children’s responsiveness. Furthermore, teachers’ questioning in the Mandarin Chinese context remains underexplored. This study examines how text-based questions and life-experience based questions influenced teacher-child talk during two shared-book reading activities. The participants included 88 children and 15 teachers who were randomly paired with 5 to 7 children for one-on-one shared book reading sessions on different themes, totaling 88 dyads. All the sessions were videotaped and transcribed. We coded teachers’ questions by type and content based on level of cognitive demand, and the form of response elicited from the children. The results indicate that life-experience based questions significantly, positively predicted children’s verbal response, when controlling for the variables of children’s Expressive Vocabulary Test scores, age, quantity of teachers’ questions, and book themes. Conversely, text-based questions negatively predicted children’s verbal responses. Open questions (rather than closed questions) were associated with increased verbal response from the children. These findings suggest that teachers could increase the effectiveness of shared-book reading and preschoolers’ engagement in discussions by incorporating more open-ended, life-experience based questions.
Parental bonding is defined as the affectionate tie a parent feels towards their infant. These feelings generally arise prenatally and increase in intensity over the course of pregnancy, both in mothers and in fathers. Bonding is fundamental for positive parenting behaviors and optimal child development. Few quantitative studies systematically examined what factors contribute to optimal bonding in fathers during pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to examine whether a variety of risk factors (symptoms of depression and anxiety, stress, and repetitive negative thinking) and resilience factors (self-compassion and trait mindfulness facets) were associated with prenatal paternal bonding and to explore potential mechanisms. In total, 66 expectant fathers with an average age of 33.7 years completed online questionnaires during the second or third trimester of pregnancy to assess the variables of interest. Analyses demonstrated that more symptoms of depression and anxiety and elevated levels of stress were associated with poorer bonding. In addition, less repetitive negative thinking, and more self-compassion and non-judging of inner experience were indirectly related to higher levels of paternal bonding through lower levels of stress. Findings suggest that expectant fathers who suffer from psychological distress, have more repetitive, negative, or intrusive thoughts, and tend to be more judgmental and self-critical may be at risk for suboptimal prenatal bonding. Providing adequate support for fathers at risk, perhaps in the form of mindfulness-based interventions, may be essential in order to cope with the challenges of new fatherhood and facilitate the process of bonding with the unborn child.
Process-based consent conceives of sexual consent as a process whereby individuals are continuously considering and have concern for their sexual partner’s willingness to continue engaging in sexual behavior without coercion. The current study used cross-sectional survey data and hierarchical linear regression to examine the independent and interactive effects of sex-related alcohol use attitudes, hostility toward women, and peer support for abuse on college men’s process-based consent (N= 463;Mage = 19; 93% heterosexual; 64% White, non-Hispanic). Findings revealed significant main effects of all three primary study variables on process-based consent beliefs and behaviors while controlling for fraternity membership, relationship status, and sexual history. A significant three-way interaction indicated that permissive sex-related alcohol use attitudes may inhibit process-based consent among college men with higher levels of hostility toward women who also believe their peers hold rape-supportive attitudes. These findings indicate that education around consent is necessary but may not be sufficient for preventing sexual violence. Interventions developed with and delivered by peer leaders that challenge harmful peer group norms about sex-related alcohol use and the mistreatment of women may create a social environment with more favorable conditions for changing individual college men’s beliefs and behaviors.
Research regarding workers’ well-being over time during COVID-19 has primarily used variable-centered approaches (e.g., ANOVA) to explore changes in negative well-being. However, variable-centered approaches provide insufficient information on the different well-being experiences that diverse workers may have experienced during COVID-19. Furthermore, researchers have understudied positive well-being in workers’ general lives and work during COVID-19. We used latent trajectory analysis, a person-centered analysis, to explore diverse well-being trajectories Canadian workers experienced during the first few months of COVID-19 across distress, flourishing, presenteeism, and thriving at work measures. We hypothesized that: H1) Intragroup differences would be present on each well-being indicator at study onset; H2) Different longitudinal trajectories would emerge for each well-being indicator (i.e., some workers’ scores would get better, some would get worse, and some would remain the same); and H3) Factors at different ecological levels (self, social, workplace, pandemic) would predict membership to the different trajectories. Canadian workers (N= 648) were surveyed March 20-27th, April 3rd-10th, and May 20-27th of 2020. Depending on the well-being indicator, and supporting H1, three to five well-being trajectories were identified. Providing some support for H2, distress and presenteeism trajectories improved over time or stayed stagnant; flourishing and thriving at work trajectories worsened or stayed stagnant. Providing some support for H3, self- (gender, age, disability status, trait resilience), social- (family functioning), workplace- (employment status, financial strain, sense of job security), and pandemic-related (perceived vulnerability to COVID-19) factors significantly predicted well-being trajectory membership. Recommendations for diverse stakeholders (e.g., employers, mental health organizations) are discussed.
This study explored students’ prosocial efficacy and reading outcomes in a culturally relevant summer reading program for underrepresented students. From a positive developmental approach, the reading program focuses on topics rooted in multicultural education, with books organized according to themes such as making a difference for oneself, one’s family, the community, the country, and the world. In the mixed-method study, we analyzed the results of students’ surveys and reading tests (n= 87) and interviews with two teachers and a program coordinator. Students’ initial prosocial efficacy was positively related to reading test scores at the end of the intervention; the positive linking between the two variables was more remarkable in the younger children group and with female students. The supplementary findings from the interview analysis of adult participants (teachers and staff) indicate that underrepresented students from culturally relevant education are more likely to experience a higher sense of belonging and show greater reading engagement related to various social issues. This study’s findings provide valuable insights into what strategies of the SEL approach should be considered to support the social-emotional and academic growth of underrepresented students in future education.
In this study, we explore the relationship between town size and subjective well-being (SWB) in Latin America. We utilize data from theLatinobarómetrosurvey from 2005 to 2015, employing multilevel modeling to analyze individual responses to life satisfaction as an indicator of SWB. We refine the town size categories provided in theLatinobarómetroby cross-referencing the geographic information with the United Nations Demographic Yearbook, one of our main contributions, leaving us with more refined town size categories than previous research. Given previous theories, we also explore how education moderates the town size-SWB relationship. Our findings reveal that individuals in towns with populations between 10,000 and 500,000 report lower life satisfaction compared to those in smaller or larger towns. Controlling for national macroeconomic conditions reverses the positive association between SWB and living in a very large city. Furthermore, we find some support for the notion that highly-educated individuals are more satisfied than the low-educated in large cities. This study comprehensively underscores the importance of refining town size data and suggests avenues for future research to deepen collective understanding of the ‘geography of happiness’ in Latin America.
This study details the methodology of a case study conducted with children aged 6–7 on COVID-19, emphasizing their important roles as co-researchers. During the study, children’s competencies were highlighted, and their voices were listened to with minimal adult interference. The research was conducted using the research with-children method, and 14 first-grade students from a private primary school in Istanbul, Turkey, actively contributed. Children participated in the research as researchers through their drawings, photographs, and individual and group interviews. The research process revealed that when children choose their research topics and create their questions, they enthusiastically engage and take ownership of their learning, fostering leadership and active participation. Research involving children should not be viewed merely as asking questions through adults. Using participant-friendly methods can enhance the enjoyment and meaning of the study for everyone involved.
In recent years, a small number of studies have emphasized that subjective well-being of individuals depends not only on income but also consumption and wealth. However, only a few have examined the influence of all three variables simultaneously. Empirical studies have also analyzed the role of self-centered and community-centered inequalities but the inclusion of both measures in the same specification is scarce. In a departure from much of the existing literature, this paper analyzes concurrently the influence of all three economic well-being indicators and both types of inequalities on subjective well-being. We find that absolute levels of income, consumption and wealth all have a significant positive effect that remains robust even after the inclusion of self-centered and community-centered inequalities in the regression equations. The evidence indicates that both types of inequalities are important considerations for subjective well-being, but with different influences. Self-centered inequality measured using reference group average has a positive signaling effect, while inequality defined by the position of an individual within the distribution of the relevant economic well-being indicator has a negative comparison effect. Whereas community-centered inequality in income has a positive signaling effect, consumption and wealth inequalities have a negative comparison effect.
States, NGOs, and civil society organizations pursue complementary pathways and community sponsorship as an innovative solution to dwindling refugee resettlement numbers, restrictive asylum policies, and hostility to the reception of migrants. Emerging models tend to be top-down, designed by national governments, and implemented by regional and local NGO partners. The Humanitarian Corridors project, however, represents a unique counterexample. From the bottom-up, faith-based, non-state groups designed Humanitarian Corridors, mobilized resources, and negotiated with national governments for permission to create a new pathway to protection for forced migrants to apply for asylum on EU territory. Through a case study of Humanitarian Corridors in Italy and Belgium, established in 2015 and 2017, respectively, this article analyzes how this complementary pathway emerged. Drawing from the migration governance, negotiation, and resettlement literature, this article foregrounds the efforts of the faith-based groups to engage with national political decision-makers; examines the negotiations over the legal, financial, operational, and political issues key to creating Humanitarian Corridors; and offers explanations as to how and why an agreement was reached. Based on 35 in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted with faith-based groups and key political decision-makers directly involved in the negotiations, this article fills empirical gaps in our understanding of civil society, specifically faith-based, groups as agents driving the design and implementation of complementary pathways through direct negotiation with national governments.
Human attitudes towards species and attributes of wildlife contribute to support for conservation. However, there is limited information on how perceptions of conservation as a concept and process influence attitudes towards endangered species conservation. Furthermore, the question ofwhosociety attributes as being responsible for the conservation of endangered species still looms. We address how perceptions towards wildlife and endangered species conservation predict ascriptions of responsibility for conservation through a survey of 1,049 residents of Arkansas, USA, about their attitudes towards and understandings of wildlife and endangered species conservation, their perceptions of and experiences with wildlife agencies, and their beliefs about the responsibilities various interested parties bear with regards to conserving endangered species. Respondents held generally positive attitudes towards wildlife conservation and endangered species conservation, as well as government wildlife agencies (US Fish and Wildlife Service and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission). Respondents perceived all interested parties (i.e., all Americans, all residents of Arkansas, licensed hunters/anglers in Arkansas, Arkansas landowners with endangered species on their land, and nongovernmental conservation organizations) as at least somewhat responsible for endangered species conservation in Arkansas. Ascriptions of responsibility to interested parties were often positively predicted by variables related to the importance of wildlife to ecosystem health and conservation costs. Our findings illustrate the perceived value of endangered species as a public resource, suggesting support for conservation efforts and their funding that has implications across the United States.
This article explores the embodied dimension of authoring life trajectories for individuals who have undergone heart transplantation. Confronting the radical otherness of existential finitude can create a rich context for examining the relationships between authorship, corporeality, and creative processes. By integrating Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of the body with Susanne Langer’s theory of affective semiosis and presentational signs, this work aims to foster a productive dialogue between these perspectives, grounded in Semiotic Cultural Psychology, which meta-theoretically synthesizes a diverse range of knowledge on the transformative interaction between individuals and culture. The article presents three participants’ cases, selected for their ideographic expressiveness, as empirical evidence that both enlivens and enriches this study’s theoretical and epistemological foundations. The fragments of participants’ elaborations were derived from individual interviews conducted at the IMIP heart transplant clinic between 2022 and 2023. IMIP is a university hospital located in Recife. The interviewees were adults who had undergone transplantation at least one year prior. The discussion of the reports highlights three interpretative axes: (a) embodied ambiguities and tensions experienced; (b) living metaphors and potential presentational signs regarding life trajectories; (c) ways of referencing the future and temporality of experiences felt intensely in the present and their methods of reconstructing the past. The interpretative analysis of participants’ metaphors aims to shed light on the role of corporeality in the construction of meaning and, consequently, in the creative perspective of life and the sense of authorship when facing the alterity, in this case, specifically of illness and consecutive heart transplantation. This article seeks to contribute to studying affective semiosis and corporeality in Cultural Psychology by highlighting its hermeneutic relevance as a critical feature of the human cultural construction of the self, others, and the world.
A major focus in pastoralism studies has been on the socially porous or open-access nature of pastoral tenure systems that allow herd movements to respond to shifting availabilities of water and pasture without social constraints. We address the important question of whether herd movements in socially porous tenure regimes are influenced by the social identities of encampment host and visitor, reflecting other needs of mobile pastoralism requiring social cooperation. We assessed pastoral tenure characteristics and the social identities of encampment hosts and visitors at 1014 mapped encampment points in southeastern Chad. We found that under a socially porous tenure regime, visitation is biased toward co-membership of Arab clans. Informants point to the importance of social connections at encampments that facilitate actions to maintain resource access and reduce security risks. Together, these findings support multi-level institutional hybrid structures often found in customary pastoral organization as an important component in transhumance governance institutions.

This article describes the findings of a study that explored potential factors that influence the pass rate for those taking marriage and family therapy (MFT) licensing exams, both the national and California exams. An online, national survey was conducted to determine factors associated with passing the MFT licensing exams. The survey included measures of test anxiety, coping strategies, perceived stress, and experience of discrimination. The demographic results included patterns of racial and age disparities similar to those reported by the Association of Social Work Boards (2022), especially for Black respondents. Specific and readily implemented recommendations for making the current exams more equitable include (a) changing the phrasing of questions, (b) clarifying and reducing the scope of the content, (c) reducing the number of questions during the 4-hour period, and (d) ensuring adequate accommodations for disabilities.
The paper explores the relative roles of men’s and women’s sex composition preferences for women’s desire to stop childbearing in developing countries. The analysis covers 45 countries, using Demographic and Health Survey couples datasets from the years 2010 to 2021. Probabilities of women’s desire to stop childbearing are considered when the sex composition of children matches the ideals of both the woman and her partner, of the woman or her partner only, and of neither of them. Models with country fixed effects are estimated for two pooled samples, one including couples from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where sex composition of children is rarely linked to fertility, and the other one including couples from all other regions. The analysis has shown that in case men and women disagreed on whether current sex composition of children matched their ideals, women’s unmatched preferences were more strongly related to their desires to have one more child, both in and outside SSA. In the non-SSA countries, agreement of both spouses in their dissatisfaction with sex composition of children additionally raised the probability of women’s desire for the next child. However, men’s unmatched fertility preferences played no role in women’s fertility desires in SSA. Both the priority of women’s sex composition ideal for children and the importance of agreement between spouses are not expected in the context of family patriarchy. The results suggest that developing countries are not in a sharp contrast on roles of men and women in taking fertility decisions, at least in what concerns sex composition of children.
Various life activities, such as sleep, physical activity (PA), screen use, and learning, are closely related to the mental health and subjective well-being (SWB) of the old adults. Previous studies have focused on a single life activity and used flawed statistical methods, which lead to divergent results, as co-dependency between activities were neglected. This study aimed to explore the relationship between daily activity time and depression and SWB in the old adult group from the perspective of time composition. In this study, we collected data on the sleep, moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), light PA (LPA), screen use, and learning times of 1,738 old adults from 28 provinces in China. Analyses were performed using a compositional data analysis (CoDA) and isotemporal substitution model (ISM). The study results show that, considering changes in time spent on other activities, learning and LPA were positively associated with SWB and negatively associated with depression. In contrast, MVPA time was negatively associated with SWB and positively associated with depression. Screen use was not associated with SWB but positively associated with depression, and sleep was negatively associated with SWB but had no correlation with depression. The ISM showed that the most effective way to improve SWB and reduce depression is to reduce time spent on MVPA and increase time for learning or LPA.This study was the first to analyze life activities from the perspective of time composition (how to change life activities’ time allocation) to improve well-being and reduce depression among Chinese old adults and provide some practical life advice.
The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionally affected parents with young children whose incomes are below the federal poverty threshold. However, studies examining life changes related to parents’ mental well-being due to pandemic effects are limited. In addition, given the racial disparities in mental health established in prior literature, clarifying the role of race in the relationships between life changes and parents’ mental well-being may help identify culturally responsive interventions that support racially/ethnically diverse families in crisis. Therefore, using a cross-sectional survey, this descriptive and exploratory study examined the impact of COVID-19 on the life changes of 408 English-speaking parents of preschool children whose incomes were below the federal poverty threshold. Half of the parents indicated that the pandemic had a negative impact on their life, including loss of employment, financial difficulty, difficulty accessing food, and challenges with finding childcare. While some parents reported feeling closer to their children, the majority felt more stressed, anxious, and depressed after the pandemic started. Not surprisingly, physical activity and better parent-child relationships were associated with reduced levels of stress and depression in parents in addition to access to childcare support. Interestingly, the negative impact of the pandemic was more correlated with White parents’ stress, anxiety, and depression than Black parents. During the post-pandemic phase, providing parental support to improve family cohesion and interactions is promising in minimizing stress, anxiety, and depression. Results from this study should be interpreted with caution due to the nature of the cross-sectional design and use of self-report data from parents.
The article explores the sociology of the family in Italy, examining its contribution to the public debate and its role in understanding the major transformations of the family. The focus is on a few key issues, including secularization and the crisis of religious marriage, the reduction in the number of children, separations and divorces, changing couple lifestyles and gender roles, socialization within multigenerational families, new biographical paths, reconciling family and work, migrant families, the aging population process, and family care tasks. The sociology of the family has seen significant transformation since the 1970s, often with contrasting sociological paradigms. While from different perspectives, the empirical research conducted by sociologists of the family has made it possible to understand families’ specific resources in Italy, as well as their needs, on both a material and a relational level. Particular attention has been paid to the tasks of socio-education of new generations and the care of fragile and elderly members. Italian sociologists have contributed to make evident the post-modern dialectic between the rights of individuals, women and men, and the rights of families that can promote a sense of belonging, solidarity, and common good. In this sense, sociologists have played an important role in giving concrete shape to interventions to monitor families’ transformations and needs (such as the National Family Observatory and the ISTAT multi-purpose surveys) and to support families (the National Plan for Families and, recently, the Family Act). Finally, the article sheds light on open issues on which the work of family sociologists is mostly focused today, with special attention to the future of the family and its role in the development of society.
This article explores the role of constructive anger in motivating and sustaining climate action. It considers relevant research in climate psychology with special attention to the dynamic between climate-related anger, action, and hope. The psychological research is then applied to a reconstruction of the concept of anger and hope in philosophical and theological approaches. Developing the concept of constructive anger, this article suggests that such constructive anger can be a factor in moving through apathy, fear, and depression and mobilizing toward collective climate action. Climate-related anger can be relieved through collective forms of climate action and the sense of collective efficacy that can emerge in becoming active. These can become a means to generating resistant, active, constructive forms of hope that can be distinguished from deceptive forms of hope.
Recreational spaces, such as local parks, are important public spaces for the community to engage in various activities. With the global ageing population, the concept of multigenerational recreational spaces has become popular in recent years with the aim to design active spaces to cater for all age groups, including older people. However, designing multigenerational spaces that enable safe usage by older people can be challenging due to the competing interests and needs of different age groups. This paper is a reflective narrative describing four case studies of multigenerational outdoor spaces in Melbourne, Australia with the inclusion of age-friendly equipment and analysing parks layout and design using aerial imagery data. Factors impacting safe usage of the space by older people were identified and discussed. The main challenges identified in the recreational case study areas included: proximity of the seniors’ exercise area relative to children’s play-spaces, accessibility, layout of the area, and surrounding features which can pose potential safety risks for older people or be a deterrent for visiting the parks. The information described in this paper provides practical learnings relating to park layout, proximity of different spaces, and strategies that may be required to be implemented to facilitate safe usage of the space by older people for better multigenerational design. A national recreational age-friendly policy is also needed to provide overarching guidelines to assist local governments in the design and delivery of inclusive multigenerational recreational spaces.
Loneliness is a common feeling often framed in negative terms. It can take several forms, including social, emotional, and existential loneliness, or through the concept of solitude, which is the desire to be alone. This qualitative study explores these types of loneliness among Swedish parents who regret having children. Our analysis of 29 interviews shows that loneliness is intertwined with regretting parenthood. Participants perceived that parental regret was unconventional, socially taboo, and unspeakable, which resulted in feelings of loneliness, shame, and guilt. They also reported that healthcare professionals, friends, and family rarely acknowledge parental feelings of regret and loneliness. Since loneliness is associated with the potential for mental health issues, it is important to build support structures for parents. In Sweden, the welfare state relies on healthcare professionals (such as nurses, midwives, and psychologists) to support parents. There is hence a need to create better support structures for parents dealing with regret and loneliness, including specialized training for healthcare professionals who work with these vulnerable groups.
Severity of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with increased relationship distress and decreased relationship satisfaction. The loved ones of individuals with OCD often engage in family accommodation (FA) behaviors that serve the same function as compulsive behavior engaged in by the individual with OCD. The current study aims to expand the literature by examining target variables from the perspective of the individual with OCD. Participants included 139 adults with self-reported OCD who were in a romantic relationship. A treatment and non-treatment seeking sample was recruited in the US through clinics and clinicians specializing in OCD treatment. Results indicated the following: (1) a significant positive association between OCD symptom severity and FA, (2) a significant negative association between OCD symptom severity and relationship satisfaction, and (3) an interaction between FA and OCD symptom severity when predicting relationship satisfaction such that FA moderates the negative association between OCD and relationship satisfaction. At high levels of OCD symptom severity, FA was found to be negatively associated with relationship satisfaction; however, at low levels of OCD symptom severity, FA was positively associated with relationship satisfaction. Findings suggest the importance of addressing family accommodation in treatment of individuals with OCD, especially at higher levels of severity.
This study examined the predictors of financial assets (savings and retirement assets) at early midlife in a sample of 1,092 individuals (93.7% Black American) who grew up in low-income neighborhoods. Data were drawn from the Chicago Longitudinal Study, which has tracked participants from early childhood to midlife and consists of participant, parent, teacher surveys, and administrative records. The main outcomes were savings in 2019 dollars (log) and savings in the top quartile of the study sample, both self-reported at age 35–37. Hierarchical linear and binary logistic regression analyses identified many significant (p < .05 or p < .01) predictors of assets, including: Involvement in child welfare system by age 5 (b = − 1.55), Child-Parent Center preschool participation (b = 0.77), early math achievement (b = 0.05), socio-emotional adjustment (0.18), grade retention (b = − 1.14), school quality (b = 1.50), and juvenile arrest (b = − 2.17). The strongest alterable predictors in the full model were involvement in child welfare system, socio-emotional adjustment, grade retention, school quality, and juvenile arrest. The full model also indicated that males had greater savings and Black participants fewer savings. Parent expectations and involvement as well as school quality also predicted top quartile savings status. Implications for future research and practice are discussed. The contribution of school experiences in early and middle childhood suggests greater investments in programs that promote socio-emotional learning and academic success.
This article contends that Western iterations of sovereignty and its apparatuses produce, in part, souls and selves that have contributed to destructive, depersonalizing relations between human beings, other species, and the Earth. Given this, it is necessary to reimagine the notion of “soul” in relation to the idea of anarchy with the aim of creating more life-enhancing and inclusive eco-social-political relations. The underlying premise of this article is that anarchic souls are an existential reality that, in the West, have mostly been hidden, denied, or suppressed as a result of persons internalizing the philosophical and theological ideas, beliefs, and values associated with varied apparatuses of domination.
Positive paternal involvement during early childhood is important for fostering healthy development. However, mental health conditions, particularly depression, can significantly limit a father's ability to engage constructively. This study explored whether religiosity can act as a resource for fathers, potentially mitigating the adverse effects of depression on their ability to engage in their child’s life. Analyzing survey data from 1147 fathers with children aged two to eight, the study investigated the how religiosity and depression interact across four domains of paternal involvement: engagement, warmth, harsh punishment, and positive control. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that fathers with higher religiosity scores exhibited more warmth, greater engagement, and higher levels of both harsh punishment and positive control techniques. Fathers with more depression symptoms were associated with more frequent harsh punishment behaviors and lower reports of warmth compared to fathers with less depression symptoms. Notably, a significant interaction effect between depression and religiosity was identified, indicating that fathers with high levels of both depressive symptoms and religiosity were at the greatest risk of engaging in harsh punishment behaviors. These findings suggest that while religiosity may support positive parenting behaviors, it may also intensify the use of harsh punishment among fathers struggling with depression. This highlights the need for targeted interventions to help fathers manage their depression and adopt positive parenting practices.
This study empirically investigated the mechanisms underlying work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict’s effect on second-child fertility intention by focusing on parental burnout and grandparent support. A sample of 1072 Chinese respondents who had already had one child were surveyed. The results of the two-wave longitudinal study showed that both work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict exerted a significant negative effect on second-child fertility intention. Mediation path analysis revealed that both independent variables had significant positive effects on parental burnout, while parental burnout exhibited significant negative effects on the dependent variable. Subsequently, our study confirmed that parental burnout served as a mediating variable between work-to-family conflict, family-to-work conflict, and second-child fertility intention. Furthermore, grandparent support moderated only the direct positive effect of work-to-family conflict on parental burnout and the indirect effect of work-to-family conflict on second-child fertility intention via parental burnout. Thus, the indirect effect of work-to-family conflict on second-child fertility intention is weakened when grandparent support is high. The study offers implications that mitigating the negative effects of family-to-work conflict on second-child fertility intention require support not only from the micro-ecosystem of the family, but also from the meso- and macro-ecosystems, such as organizations and society.
BackgroundAortopexy is a procedure to reduce pressure on the trachea in children with severe tracheomalacia. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has not been studied in children who have undergone aortopexy; we aimed to explore parents’ perceptions of their child’s HRQoL before and after aortopexy.MethodsParents of children < 18 years who underwent aortopexy at a quaternary specialist centre were purposively sampled and invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. Data were analysed using reflective thematic and content analysis.ResultsEight interviews (23–56 min) were completed with parents whose children were aged 1.9–12.1 years. HRQoL is explored through themes: a challenging diagnosis, lifechanging, and an understanding of limitations. Parents struggled to obtain a diagnosis of tracheomalacia while their child experienced serious symptoms. Aortopexy was seen as life-saving and allowed a return to family life. Airway safety, having their health and achieving a better quality of life were important outcomes of the procedure.ConclusionQuality of life following aortopexy was perceived to be greatly improved. Children still struggled in aspects of their life, however families worked within their child’s limitations, appreciating the life-saving nature of the intervention, and accepting the complexities of their child’s comorbidities. Holistic interventions are important for those at risk of poor HRQoL outcomes.
In this paper, I share insights from ongoing ethnographic fieldwork among adult Danes who identify as having Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but do not meet the clinical standards and have yet to receive a diagnosis. These individuals are particularly relevant to the ongoing debates about under- and overdiagnosis of ADHD, as their claims to the diagnosis influence and mirror societal perceptions of what is considered normal and what is seen as a condition. Despite their symptoms not strictly meeting diagnostic criteria, thus risking overdiagnosis and associated psychiatric labeling, they perceive themselves as distinct from ‘normal’ people. Through a critical anthropological lens, I argue that medicalizing variations in human personality represents a contemporary societal epistemic error, drawing on Gregory Bateson’s work. I highlight the dynamics of diagnosis versus notions of normality in diagnosing and self-diagnosing ADHD. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for addressing concerns of overdiagnosis as well as underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. By illuminating the complexities of diagnostic processes and their societal implications, I aim to contribute to a richer understanding of mental health discourse and practice.
Parenting is a product of complex, interactive, and interwoven factors, which are affected by a variety of characteristics, including parent characteristics and the family environment. Such characteristics, including marital dissatisfaction and poor mental health, could place infants at an increased risk for affect regulation difficulties. The current longitudinal study extended previous research by examining how multiple factors of the parenting environment are associated with infant affect regulation with mothers and fathers. Families (n= 89, primarily White) from the Southeastern United States were assessed at 4 and 8 months of age. Parent mental health (anxiety and depression symptoms, well-being) and marital satisfaction were measured by questionnaires when infants were 4 months old. Infant affect regulation was measured via infant affect observational ratings during a face-to-face play task at 4 and 8 months of age. Mothers, who were higher in well-being, had infants lower in negative affect. Infants, whose fathers were low in social anxiety and had higher marital satisfaction, had decreased levels of negative affect. Findings provide target areas for promoting infant affect regulation, such as parent marital satisfaction and parent mental health.
Sociodemographic disadvantage is a stressor related with unsupportive parenting practices, but little is known about the process by which it may undermine early parental emotion socialization. In the current study, we examined (1) the direct association between sociodemographic risk and supportive emotion socialization and (2) possible indirect effects via psychological distress and mother-oriented cry processing (i.e., negative cognitions about crying) in a short-term 3-wave longitudinal study that followed a stratified sample of 259 first-time mothers from pregnancy through 14-months postpartum. Sociodemographic risk included mothers’ age, education, and income reported by the expectant mothers prenatally. Psychological distress was assessed prior to the 6-month laboratory visit using mothers’ reports on depressive symptoms, difficulty regulating emotions, and trait positive and negative emotions. During the 6-month laboratory visit, mother-oriented cry processing was assessed using a video-recall procedure. Supportive emotion socialization at 14 months was assessed based on observer-rated maternal sensitivity during two distress eliciting tasks and maternal reports. Consistent with prediction, the first indirect pathway from higher sociodemographic disadvantage to lower supportive emotional socialization through higher mother-oriented cry processing was statistically significant, however the second indirect pathway from higher sociodemographic disadvantage to higher psychological distress to higher mother-oriented cry processing to lower supportive emotion socialization was not. Over and above these indirect effects, higher sociodemographic disadvantage was directly associated with lower supportive emotion socialization. Psychological distress was not significantly directly associated with emotion socialization. These findings highlight the importance of policies and interventions that provide financial assistance to the mothers experiencing sociodemographic disadvantage and target their psychological wellbeing.
This study investigates the prevalence, stability, and associated factors of internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents within a clinical setting. The sample included 299 patients aged 3–17 years from a Child and Adolescent Mental Health outpatient clinic, followed over one year. Internalizing symptoms were assessed using the parent-rated version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), completed at baseline and at one-year follow-up. Stability was evaluated using prospective consistency, retrospective consistency, kappa coefficient, and Spearman’s Rho correlations. Multivariate analyses were conducted to examine associated factors. Baseline prevalence of internalizing symptoms was 40% (95% CI: 33.4-44.8%), with moderate one-year stability (ρ = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.37-0.58). Key factors associated with internalizing symptoms at follow-up included: For girls, higher baseline SDQ emotional symptoms (OR = 2.12,p< 0.001), lower paternal education (OR = 9.70,p= 0.003), and lower SDQ hyperactivity/inattention scores (OR = 0.70,p= 0.016). For boys, comorbid externalizing symptoms (OR = 8.18,p< 0.001), maternal anxiety (OR = 2.35,p= 0.031), maternal unemployment (OR = 2.13,p= 0.043), and a sibling diagnosed with ADHD (OR = 0.10,p= 0.012). For children, peer problems (OR = 1.20,p= 0.02) and the absence of an externalizing diagnosis (OR = 0.33,p= 0.013). For adolescents, lower paternal education (OR = 5.99,p= 0.003), higher SDQ emotional symptoms scores (OR = 13.48,p< 0.001), and female gender. Gender and age differences in associated factors highlight the interplay of neurobiological and social influences. These findings underscore the importance of considering gender and age-specific factors when developing preventive and therapeutic interventions for internalizing symptoms in clinical populations.
Approximately two-thirds of US birth-to-age-three-year-olds attend Infant Toddler Care and Education (ITCE) full- or part-time, making it the fastest growing segment of childcare. Despite widespread understanding of the importance of the first three years to lifetime learning and development trajectories, and recognition of the need for quality ITCE for families in the workforce and the US economy, ITCE remains underresearched. Too little is known about what qualifications and characteristics, pedagogical beliefs, and needs and motivations of ITCE professionals related to ensuring quality for children and families. Needed too, are valid and reliable tools to assess these attributes for use in pre- and in-service professional development of ITCE program administration and staff. Thus, the researchers developed and tested reliability and validity of a self-report survey – the Beliefs About Infant Toddler Education and Care (BAITEC). BAITEC items reflect NAEYC’s developmentally appropriate practice (DAP) principles for birth-to-age-three along with other widely adopted DAP-inspired guidelines for ITCE practice from major professional organizations including WestEd PITC, RIE, and ZERO TO THREE. Existing beliefs/practices instruments were used as models of survey language and structure. Reliability (internal consistency), and face, content, construct, and criterion related validity were tested using descriptive statistics, factor analyses, and hierarchical multiple regression. BAITEC was found to be a reliable and valid measure of ITCE teachers’ beliefs and education level moderated the relationship between beliefs and self-reported practices. Implications are identified for use in pre-and-in-service professional development.
This study considered the intricate transition processes as children moved from preschool to primary school in Australia and Denmark. By employing Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological model, our investigations explored how children’s perspectives reflected and reproduced cultural and societal influences during the transition period. A qualitative approach, drawing on focus group interviews and a constructivist analytic approach based on grounded theory, supported the consideration of children’s reflections on transition to primary school. The results indicated that proximal processes played a crucial role in shaping children’s transition experience during this critical period. In Australia children’s perspectives emphasized feeling comfortable, safe, and secure, as underscored in the curriculum frameworkBelonging, Being and Becoming: The Early Years Learning Framework for Australia. In the Danish context, children’s articulations aligned with the legislative acts and reflected their developing independence when navigating the school’s new academic, social, and personal demands. These findings highlighted the necessity of considering children’s feelings and development when they transitioned from preschool to school. To ensure effective transitions, educational policies and practices should have enhanced targeted support for children unfamiliar with school environments or lacking confidence in their academic abilities, while promoting teacher-led initiatives that scaffolded children’s social, emotional, and personal development during this critical phase. By focusing on the individual experiences and the institutional context, we can better support children in their transition to school and promote their overall well-being and engagement in learning.
The link between parenting styles and adolescents’ cyberbullying is well-established. However, few studies have examined fathers and mothers’ parenting styles separately, and even fewer have explored the relationship between parenting styles and cyberbullying from the perspective of attitude towards human dignity. Therefore, the current cross-sectional study aimed to investigate whether attitude towards human dignity underlie the associations between parenting styles and cyberbullying among adolescents. 768 adolescents from two different middle schools in China were measured for their perceptions of parenting style, cyberbullying behavior, and attitude towards human dignity. Regression analysis showed that except for paternal overprotection, both the cognition and behavioral tendency of human dignity had a significant indirect effect on fathers’/mothers’ parenting styles and cyberbullying. Still, the emotion of human dignity had no significant indirect effect.
Theory of mind (ToM) describes a child’s ability to accurately attribute mental states to themselves and others. ToM has been conceptualized as a protective factor against psychopathology across childhood. Little is known about potential moderators of this association. For example, it is unclear whether there are subgroups of children for whom well-developed ToM plays a stronger protective role for adaptive functioning compared to other children. In a community sample of 467 children, this study examined whether child temperament assessed at age 3 years moderates the association between ToM at age 3 years and internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 5 years. We used a community detection approach to identify three distinct temperament groups: emotionally and behaviorally well-regulated (EBR), emotionally and behaviorally dysregulated (EBD), and introverted and overcontrolled (IOC). Results from moderated regression analyses suggest that social competence had a stronger protective role for the two temperament groups at elevated risk for emotional and behavioral problems, i.e., EBD and IOC. For the IOC group, greater ToM was associated with reduced externalizing symptoms. Results support the view that ToM, one aspect of social competence, may serve as a protective factor against the development of psychopathology, particularly among introverted and overcontrolled children.
This study examines the impact of Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance (D&O insurance) on shareholder value within the framework of strategic alliances (SAs). Utilizing a dataset from companies listed on the Taiwan stock market from 2009 to 2019, our analysis identifies a significant positive correlation between D&O insurance and abnormal returns around the time of strategic alliance announcements. This beneficial effect is especially marked in international, horizontal, equity-related, and marketing alliances. Our overall findings support the monitoring mechanism hypothesis, which suggests that D&O insurance is indicative of robust governance practices. By providing coverage, D&O insurance enhances managerial efficiency and reduces the potential for agency conflicts due to information asymmetry-a frequent concern in strategic alliances-thereby enhancing shareholder value. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting how D&O insurance can act as a pivotal governance mechanism that reassures investors of a firm’s commitment to effective management and strategic alignment, particularly in complex alliance settings.
Adopting a family system perspective, this study sets out to explore the association between family configurations of mother-child and father-child attachment to better understand children’s externalizing and internalizing behaviors in toddlerhood. A total of 182 heterosexual biparental families and their children (90 boys) were recruited from the general population. Most of the fathers and mothers were Canadian-born and the personal income and education level of the parents were high in comparison to the population of the province of Quebec at large. Attachment was assessed by direct observation using the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) in infants aged 12–18 months. Children’s internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed in toddlers aged 24–30 months using questionnaires completed by both parents. Results showed that infants with resistant attachment to one parent and secure attachment to the other parent have more externalizing behaviors than children with a secure attachment to both parents. Moreover, children with a disorganized attachment to both parents showed more internalizing and externalizing problems than children with a disorganized attachment with one parent and secure with the other parent. These results highlight the need of adopting a systemic family perspective to better understand the link between attachment and children’s behavior problems.
Despite substantial investments in mental health care and healthcare accessibility in Europe, the mental well-being of young people is on a concerning decline. This deterioration is further exacerbated by recent global crises, notably the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, climate change, and the deepening economic crisis leading to increased poverty and social exclusion. The main research goal was to investigate how young people entering adulthood experience polycrisis concerning stress, responsibility for crises, and self-perceived proximity. The study involved 403 young adult Poles, taking high school final exams in the years 2020–21. Assessment tools included the Brief Symptoms Inventory 18, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, Personality Inventory for ICD-11, and Flourishing Index. Using the latent class analysis, three distinct profiles were identified, representing diverse experiences of polycrisis. Group 1 primarily experienced stress related to economic crisis, reported lower depression rates and maintained relatively stable economic well-being. Group 2 confronted various aspects of polycrisis, excluding COVID-19, and carried a strong sense of responsibility for the climate crisis while experiencing emotional challenges. Group 3 experienced the full spectrum of polycrisis, showing tendencies towards perfectionism and rule rigidity, without specific mental health problems. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for developing models of young adults’ post-crisis functioning and for designing early, targeted interventions.Clinical Trial: The clinical trial identifier is NCT05930652.
Guardians ad Litem (GALs) are volunteer child advocates in the state of Florida and are largely considered as playing a critical role in the child welfare system. However, there has been limited research on their role and relationship with youth in care. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine GALs’ perspectives on their relationships with youth in the foster care system. This cross-sectional study included 555 GALs from the state of Florida in which volunteers were specifically asked to respond to an internet survey with a number of open-ended questions about their relationships with youth and how relationships developed with youth in foster care. Emergent themes related to the process of relationship building, as well as factors that influence their relationships with youth and strategies for building relationships were identified. Implications and recommendations for future research with child advocates and youth in foster care, training and support of advocates, and child welfare practice and policy are discussed.
The quality of mother-child interactions can affect child developmental outcomes, both positively and negatively. Little research has examined the factors that influence the quality of mother-infant interactions, particularly in a low-middle income country. Therefore, we examined sociodemographic, maternal, and child variables, to determine whether these were associated with the quality of maternal-infant interactions. 256 mother-infant dyads enrolled in a South African birth cohort study, the Drakenstein Child Health Study, were assessed. A comprehensive battery of sociodemographic and psychosocial questionnaires was utilised. Video footage of interaction between mothers and infants at a 14-week postnatal visit was coded and assessed using the Global Rating Scale (GRS). Hierarchical multiple linear regression models were used to examine the factors associated with the GRS domains. The domains included: (1) maternal sensitivities (sensitivity, intrusiveness, remoteness, depressive mood), (2) infant behaviours (sensitivity, inertness, distress), and (3) maternal-infant interaction. Maternal childhood trauma and smoking during pregnancy were associated with lower domain scores for the maternal contribution. Higher birth weight and initiated breastfeeding were associated with higher domain scores for infant behaviours, while maternal IPV exposure, and smoking tobacco were associated with lower domain scores for infant behaviours. Infant weight-for-age at birth and initiated breastfeeding were positively associated with the dyadic interaction. Factors associated with early positive and negative mother-infant interaction identified in this research could potentially serve as targets for intervention, with the ultimate aim of improving child developmental outcomes. Notably, no psychosocial variables were significantly associated with the dyadic interactions, emphasising how strong such interactions can be in the face of multiple stressors.
The current study tests the implications of men’s and women’s gender-related attitudes for relationship quality and wellbeing. We apply ambivalent sexism theory to differentiate between attitudes that should have detrimental versus beneficial effects for relationships by promoting antagonism (hostile sexism) versus complimentary relational roles (benevolent sexism) between men and women. Actor-partner interdependence analyses of heterosexual couples participating in a nationally representative panel study (N= 755) revealed that men’s hostile sexism predicted greater relationship conflict and lower relationship satisfaction, which in turn were associated with greater psychological distress and lower wellbeing for both men and their women partners. In contrast, men’s benevolent sexism predicted lower relationship conflict and greater satisfaction, which in turn was associated with lower distress and greater wellbeing for men but not women partners. Women’s sexist attitudes had differential effects. Women’s hostile sexism predicted lower relationship conflict and greater satisfaction, which was associated with higher wellbeing for men partners. In contrast, women’s benevolent sexism predicted greater relationship conflict, which related to greater distress and lower wellbeing for women and men partners. These results highlight the importance of gender-related attitudes on relationship quality, which has important implications for wellbeing.
The retention of volunteers amid the COVID-19 pandemic was a grave concern for voluntary associations worldwide. Due to governmental restrictions on face-to-face social interactions, voluntary associations had to curtail traditional volunteer activities and thus experienced a significant reduction in their workforce. Therefore, who stayed in or left the volunteer fields during the Pandemic is crucial for the nonprofit sector. A plausible mechanism is the degree of volunteer satisfaction that may affect whether volunteers continue working for the public good despite harsh external conditions. We employed data from the Individual Giving Survey from Singapore. The survey was conducted between April and September 2021 amid the Pandemic. The study applied a Latent Class Analysis to the Volunteer Satisfaction Index. The LCA located five subgroups of volunteers as follows: (1) highest overall volunteer satisfaction (14%), (2) high Participation Efficacy and Group Integration satisfaction (13%), (3) high Organizational Support satisfaction (10%), (4) medium Participation Efficacy (19%), and (5) low overall satisfaction (44%). Regression analyses were applied to five outcome measures of volunteer behaviors and intentions, taking the latent volunteer satisfaction classes as the main independent variables. The results indicate that those with the highest overall volunteer satisfaction were more likely to maintain their volunteer status during the Pandemic, volunteer more frequently and recently, intend to volunteer in the future, and intend to encourage others to volunteer. In conclusion, volunteer satisfaction was a key factor that prevented volunteers from ceasing civic engagement during the Pandemic.
Scholars have analyzed how structural forces and cultural factors contribute to populism, but relatively little research has been devoted to documenting or theorizing counter-populism. This study asks: how does counter-populist performance become successful? We engage the literatures of populism, political performance, and hope, and conduct a case study of the 2021 COVID outbreak in Taiwan. Drawing on a qualitative analysis of 313 newspaper reports, we find that the Taiwanese government’s counter-populist efforts succeeded through transforming an emotive context of anger into one featuring hope—a process we term “emotive transformation.” We identify three facilitating mechanisms: the enactment of key elements of hope (agency, valid pathways, support from allies, and tangible outcomes); the timely inclusion of bipartisan or nonpartisan participants; and strong collective effervescence. Our study contributes to theorizing counter-populism and helps address the “Atlantic bias” in studies of populism.
ThroughMister Rogers’ Neighborhood, Fred Rogers fostered fundamental dispositions that young children would need in their futures, including respect for the unique human qualities of others, cultivating positive peer relationships, and a heart for kindness and empathy. Fred Rogers gave his audience grace and hope to celebrate the curiosities of daily life. A small pilot study was conducted to encourage teachers to understand the importance of including a diverse range of reading materials in their classroom libraries by introducingMister Rogers’ Neighborhood. Findings from the study demonstrates dispositions and qualities on how Fred Rogers provided children with a neighborhood that understood diversity and culturally responsive teaching for all children. Teachers can encourage culturally responsive teaching by reading and providing picture books from a classroom library that encourages conversations, sharing, and interactions with peers. Therefore, the pilot study also questions teacher bias when including picture books that may be criticized for being allowed and available to children to read in classroom libraries. Each teacher has a role to play in building neighborhoods of their own in classroom libraries.Mister Rogers’ Neighborhoodhas a place in democratic living skills training for teachers to nurture the affective and social lives of young children.
This paper highlights the idea that people who have experienced unfair treatment tend to develop anticipatory injustice (i.e., expectations of unfairness in a new context). Specifically, it argues that citizens who have experienced unfair treatment in education are more likely to have a sense of powerlessness toward their own political abilities (internal political efficacy) and toward the political system (external political efficacy). Using data from the European Social Survey 2018, the paper shows that citizens who have not had a fair chance of achieving their desired educational goals express a weaker sense of political efficacy and that the negative effect of unfair treatment in education on external political efficacy (i.e., attitude toward the system) is more pronounced in countries with more responsive political systems. These findings suggest that previous unfair treatment in education can make citizens more cynical and frustrated about the responsiveness of their government, particularly in countries with higher levels of political responsiveness, where citizens with unfair educational opportunities perceive that they are unfairly disadvantaged and under-resourced (in terms of knowledge, skills, and dispositions) compared to their advantaged counterparts with whom they compete for government attention and responsiveness.
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have a powerful impact on adolescents’ development. The greater the number of stressful life events experienced, the more likely adolescents are to experience internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety. Due to the negative effects of early adversity, it is essential that research examine which protective factors might mitigate this relationship, such as emotion regulation (ER) and attachment. In the current study, the researchers examined the relationships between ACEs, ER, attachment, and anxiety among adolescents. We hypothesized that ER would mediate the relationship between ACEs and anxiety and attachment would moderate the relationship between ACEs and ER within the mediation model. A sample of adolescents (n= 105) completed measures of adolescent anxiety, ACEs, ER, and attachment. Using the PROCESS macro, a moderated mediation model was analyzed. Mother and father attachment moderated the mediation of difficulties in ER on ACEs and anxiety, suggesting that mean levels of mother and higher levels of father attachment function as a mechanism that strengthens the relationship between early negative life events and current anxiety. These findings suggest that the mother/father attachment relationship for adolescents might be of particular importance for youth who have experienced adverse life experiences and have trouble regulating their emotions.
Economic abuse, a form of intimate partner violence (IPV), is prevalent and harmful but often difficult to detect. Chinese young adults (ages 18–35) in cohabiting relationships represent a substantial yet under-researched group at a relatively high risk of economic abuse. To enhance understanding of the potential predictors and outcomes of economic abuse in this population, we examined young adults' developmental tasks of exploring finances and romance while planning their ideal future lives. Guided by attachment theory, economic empowerment, and the Vulnerability-Stress-Adaptation (VSA) model, we investigated (1) how romantic attachment orientations and financial behaviors interact in their association with economic abuse and (2) how economic abuse is associated with hopelessness among a sample of Chinese young adults in cohabiting relationships. We used cross-sectional survey data from 445 young adults in Mainland China and employed structural equation modeling to assess our research questions. We found that young adults with avoidant or anxious attachment styles were more likely to experience economic abuse, which was, in turn, associated with higher levels of hopelessness. Additionally, healthy financial behaviors mitigated the association between attachment anxiety and avoidance, economic abuse, and hopelessness. Collectively, our findings advance the understanding of the potential predictors and consequences of economic abuse. They also underscore the importance of financial education in reducing economic abuse and its negative outcomes among Chinese young adults in cohabiting relationships.
While the population of multilingual learners (MLs) in the United States has grown rapidly in recent years, many teachers feel unprepared to teach them. The professional development (PD) teachers receive is often misaligned with their particular needs and experiences. This design-based research study examined the development and impact of online PD designed with teacher input to improve writing instruction for young MLs. Data were collected over twelve months from 25 teachers in six Southeastern U.S. school districts. Researchers evaluated the impact of the PD on teachers’ knowledge and self-efficacy for teaching writing to MLs. Findings highlight how teachers made instructional moves to support the linguistic assets of their students and shifted their beliefs toward more culturally responsive perspectives. These shifts were facilitated by the core PD elements of content focus, active learning, coherence, and duration. The study highlights a need for soliciting iterative feedback on PD from teachers themselves, revising PD based on ongoing feedback, and providing practical opportunities to apply new learning.
Immigration often causes backlash, to the benefit of anti-immigrant parties. Most studies that identify the effect of immigration on native attitudes and behaviors leverage variation in inflows of newcomers who are ethnically distinct from natives. Can we therefore conclude that backlash is the general consequence of exposure to large migration flows? We theorize co-ethnic migrants are not met with backlash and are even welcomed by partisans who are politically aligned with the immigrant group. To test this, we leverage a natural experiment in the exogenous allocation of ethnic Germans arriving from the former USSR to German counties between 1996 and 2006, avoiding bias related to selection effects. Analyses of panel data yield no evidence of increased anxiety over economic issues or crime typically associated with anti-migrant backlash in counties receiving more co-ethnic migrants. Instead, we observe a rise in native empathy for immigrants, conditional on partisanship. Furthermore, we find no anti-migrant electoral backlash. Counties receiving larger inflows saw gains for the CDU party which championed ethnic German migration. This suggests ethnicity and partisanship condition the extent to which local demographic change induces political backlash. Moreover, our case shows that, under certain circumstances, mainstream and pro-immigrant parties can derive significant short-term electoral benefits from immigration.
One of the main sources of increasing population pressure in forested landscapes of Zambia is in-migration from other rural areas. This in-migration is driven by environmental degradation and limited employment options in the villages of origin, and, to a limited extent, in-migration from urban areas due to widespread unemployment and increased cost of living in cities.The current study examines the relationship between in-migration, forest clearing, and land use change in forested landscapes in Zambia. This question is especially relevant considering that in 2020, 85% of total carbon dioxide emissions in the country were attributed to Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF). Based on a dataset of 1123 households living in or near the Miombo woodlands in Zambia, we estimate a multivariate tobit model to explain forest clearing and the area under annual crops at the household level. Households reported the availability of agricultural land, natural resources, or fertile soils as their main reason for migration. Regression results showed that being an in-migrant household was associated with 28% more forest area cleared for crop production during the 5 years prior to data collection and with an 8% increase in area cultivated with annual crops. Our results add to limited available quantitative evidence on the impacts of in-migration on forest clearing and land use in tropical forest frontiers at the micro-scale. With rising in-migration in the future that leads to further forest clearing in migrant-receiving areas, the cycle can repeat itself, where increasing population pressure and deforestation can lead to environmental degradation and migration to other forested landscapes. To address this chain, future policy should aim to deal with the root causes of internal migration, including by investing in landscape restoration and sustainable agricultural intensification in origin areas.
Humans are inherently social beings and are often subject to social influence, a phenomenon known as conformity. But what traits characterize individuals who conform to group opinions? We aimed to examine the potential impact of religiosity and religious fundamentalism on conformity. With the growth of technology, many decisions are now made online, such as during video meetings. This shift prompted us to investigate online conformity in a pre-registered study. To measure conformity, we adapted Asch’s paradigm, using actors in an online video meeting to perform a simple perceptual task based on the classic line-length procedure. Our study focused on two constructs: (1) centrality of religiosity across its dimensions and (2) religious fundamentalism. We hypothesized that higher religiosity and higher levels of religious fundamentalism would be associated with greater online conformity. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that religious fundamentalism positively correlated with online conformity, whereas centrality of religiosity showed no relationship with conformity in the online setting.
As remote and flexible work becomes increasingly prevalent, the importance of building bonds among coworkers is emphasized. Beyond health considerations, the role of company community sports (CCS) in fostering integration at the group and organizational levels remains unclear, especially for underrepresented employees. This study investigates the impact of CCS participation on employees' internal group and external organizational integration using data from 12 organizations (N= 2018; Age = 30.8 ± 8.4 years; Female = 47.6%). Social integration was measured through workplace trust, organizational identification, and coworker interaction. The organizational settings and participation quality of CCS were examined to analyze their effect on integration. The results indicate that frequent and high-quality participation in CCS significantly enhances both internal group integration and external organizational integration, while CCS professionalism and intense competition have very little effect on the overall effects. However, female employees experienced lower integration levels, highlighting the need for inclusive CCS initiatives. CCS activities should cater to the diverse interests and capabilities of all employees to promote greater participation and ensure inclusivity for underrepresented groups.
The purpose of this exploratory study was to first examine the dyadic trajectory of attachment change over a longer period (i.e., 5 years) than has been examined in previous research; second, to identify a mean trajectory of attachment security for couples with no history of contact with therapy as well as the effect of therapy utilization; and third, to examine couples’ attachment trajectories for gender differences. This study included 294 heterosexual married couples (78.6% European American). One-hundred and nine (37.07%) female partners and 121 (46.60%) male partners indicated that they had never utilized therapy prior to the study or during the study (had never utilized therapy at all). Research questions were explored using dyadic longitudinal multilevel modeling with pre-existing data. Results indicate overall that couples in this sample were low on attachment insecurity at the start of data collection and became slightly more insecure over a five-year span at a statistically significant, but likely unnoticeable rate. Couples withno therapy use-everbegan the study with low attachment insecurity and remained relatively secure throughout the study. Couples whoconsistently received therapybefore and during the study reported the highest levels of insecure attachment and increased in insecurity at a faster rate in comparison to those who had never attended therapy. Males who received consistent therapy before and during the study also demonstrated significantly greater attachment insecurity than their female partners. Therapy that does not specifically focus on attachment related issues is not likely to alter attachment styles. Clinicians may wish to investigate partners’ attachment histories, including complications from trauma or abuse, and tailor treatment to attachment related issues if attachment style change is a treatment goal. Future research could examine attachment change over time for couples of lower income, more diverse racial stratification, and experiencing greater relationship distress.
Higher concentrations of heavy metals were reported mainly among adult Asian persons compared to other racial/ethnic groups in earlier NHANES cycles’ studies. We aimed to examine concentrations of metals among Asian children/adolescents compared to children/adolescents identifying with other racial/ethnic groups, considering socio-demographic factors and potential mediation by fish/shellfish consumption. Using NHANES data (2015–2018), 5293 participants (1–19 years) with blood/urinary measurements of lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic were included. Survey-weighted adjusted generalized linear models assessed differences in log-transformed metal concentrations between Asian and non-Asian participants, considering potential effect measure modification by parental education. Causal mediation effects of recent fish/shellfish consumption were estimated. Log-transformed metal concentrations were higher among Asian than among non-Asian children/adolescents. Lower parental education was associated with higher concentrations of cadmium and methylmercury among Asian participants, and effect measure modification was suggested. Proportions of the mercury exposure disparity mediated by recent fish/shellfish consumption were 9.1% (95% CI 2.6, 17.3%) for fish, and 5.7% (0.5, 12.0%) for shellfish, with similar findings for methylmercury. Overall, Asian identification was associated with higher toxic metal exposure, and among Asian children/adolescents those with parents with lower education were particularly affected. Dietary fish/shellfish intake explained a portion of the disparities. Prevention efforts should identify sources of elevated metal exposure focusing children and adolescents while considering diverse backgrounds and dietary habits including high fish consumption.
ObjectivesTo investigate differences in the prevalence of positive depression screens before and during the COVID-19 pandemic within primary care and assess patient characteristics based on depression screen results in both time periods.MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study of patients ages 12-21 years-old from two urban primary care clinics seen for well-child visits and who had completed depression screens before and during the pandemic. Additional variables evaluated included demographics, substance use, and mental health (MH) conditions such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation (SI). Paired analyses using McNemar’s Chi-squared test and paired t-test evaluated differences in variables between time periods. Patients were also categorized into four groups determined by their depression screen result in each period and characteristics between the four groups were compared using the Fisher’s exact test.ResultsOf 1621 patient charts reviewed with documented depression screens, there were 232 patients who had screens completed during both time periods. Twenty three (9.9%) patients screened positive for depressive symptoms before the pandemic and 38 (16.4%) screened positive during the pandemic. More patients had SI, depression, anxiety, and substance use during the pandemic. Patients who had at least one positive depression screen had more MH conditions than patients who had negative depression screens during both time periods.ConclusionsAmong a cohort of adolescents seen in primary care before and during the pandemic, more patients screened positive for depression and there were more MH conditions during the pandemic, demonstrating a need to prioritize MH resources for adolescents in the primary care setting.
Parental psychological control is an emotionally manipulative parenting behavior that is used to control adolescents’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Such control is associated with problematic behaviors among adolescents. Less research has examined adolescents’ beliefs about parental motivations for using psychological control or the moderating role of such beliefs on associations between psychological control and adolescents’ problematic behaviors. We analyzed data from 406 US adolescents (ages 11–19) who completed school-based surveys (2020) assessing sociodemographics, parental psychological control, adolescents’ beliefs about parental motivations for using psychological control, and adolescents’ problematic behaviors (i.e., substance use, risky cyber behaviors, over- and under-eating behaviors, depressive and anxiety symptoms, delinquency, physical and relational aggression). Participants (Mage= 15.00 [SD = 1.64], 57.6% female, 85.7% White, 5.2% Black, 2.0% Asian, 1.5% Hispanic) who reported greater maternal and paternal psychological control were more likely to engage in a range of problematic behaviors. Adolescents most commonly indicated that their mothers and fathers used psychological control to keep them safe, to control their thoughts, feelings, or behaviors, and because they perceive it to be a normative parenting behavior. Adolescents’ beliefs about their mothers’ and fathers’ motivations for using psychological control were associated with adolescents’ problematic behaviors. These beliefs also moderated associations among psychological control and problematic behaviors. Findings suggest that psychological control is differentially associated with adolescents’ problematic behaviors based on their beliefs about why their parents engage in this control. Findings highlight the importance of considering adolescents as active participants in the parenting process. Findings provide potentially important individual-level targets for intervention.
This study examines the role of fathers’ gender roles and work conditions as they independently and in combination predict father engagement with infants. In recent decades, conceptualizations of fatherhood have retained the breadwinner ideal while adding caregiving responsbilities. Despite this shift, fathers’ involvement with their children, on average, remains less than mothers. Using a longitudinal sample of 77 working-class couples, analyses were conducted with fathers’ reports of their engagement in play and instrumental caregiving tasks as the outcome. Results revealed that fathers with more egalitarian gender-role beliefs were more engaged in play with infants as reported by fathers. Coworker support was associated with fathers engaging in more instrumental tasks and play. Fathers’ beliefs about gender-roles and their workplace flexibility interacted to predict their engagement in play, with more traditional fathers being more involved under conditions of high workplace flexibility. Thus, workplace flexibility may be an important predictor of father engagement for more traditional fathers, who would otherwise be less engaged than their egalitarian counterparts. This study underscores the importance of supportive work conditions to increase engagement in fathers and suggests that the workplace might be an effective intervention site for fathers’ parenting.
This study examined the longitudinal association of family stress with child adjustment and tested mother- and father–child conflict as simultaneous mediators. On two occasions about 12 months apart, data were collected from the mothers and fathers of 477 kindergarten children from Hong Kong, China. The mean age of children at Time 1 was 52.3 months (SD= 7.18), and 47% of them were girls. At Time 1, mothers and fathers independently completed questionnaires on their family stress and provided demographic information. At Times 1 and 2, mothers and fathers independently rated their own relationships with their children and their children’s adjustment. Structural equation models revealed that, controlling for demographic factors and the prior levels of the outcome and mediator variables, family stress was associated with increases in child externalizing and internalizing behaviors and decreases in child prosocial behaviors over time. The associations of family stress with increases in child externalizing and internalizing behaviors were partially mediated by increases in both mother- and father–child conflict over time, whereas the association of family stress with decreases in child prosocial behaviors was fully mediated by increases in mother–child conflict. Theoretically, our findings highlighted the roles of both mother- and father–child conflict in understanding the relationship of family stress with child adjustment in a Chinese community. Practically, our findings pointed to the potential utility of helping mothers as well as fathers manage family stress and parent–child conflict as means to support the development of young children.
A child’s social skills development is crucial, but social functioning deficits are common. Social impairment has been associated with various risk factors, including child anxiety symptoms and parenting practices, specifically among parents who experience distress. Given the impact that anxiety and parental distress have on social functioning, it is important to examine child characteristics that could mitigate the impact. Research has identified child characteristics (i.e., leadership, functional communication, adaptive skills, executive functioning, and emotional self-control) that promote social functioning and could serve as protective factors. The present study examined the protective effects of these child characteristics on the relation between parental distress and post-treatment anxiety of children who participated in the Resilience Builder Program® (RBP; Alvord et al.,2011). The RBP is a resilience-based cognitive-behavioral group treatment for children with social impairments. A total of 76 parents completed measures before and after the RBP, providing information on parent’s self-report of psychological distress, child anxiety, and the identified child characteristics (Mage= 10.01,SD= 1.44; 77.6% White; 81.6% male). Moderation analyses indicated that for children with poor pre-treatment functioning in adaptive skills, functional communication, and leadership, parent psychological distress was related to increased post-treatment anxiety, whereas, for strong pre-treatment skills, a negative relation was detected. Results suggest that proficiency in adaptability, functional communication, and leadership may act as a protective factor from parental distress by promoting positive treatment outcomes. Such findings could inform future interventions where these skills are emphasized during a child’s treatment if the parent indicates high distress.
Credit cards, as an effective instrument to address household economic risks, play an important role in household economic behavior and decision-making. This paper is based on data from the 2015–2021 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) and investigates the impact of credit card usage on household financial vulnerability. The research results indicate that the use of credit cards significantly reduces household financial vulnerability, which is achieved by alleviating risks of income, unemployment, and health. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the impact of using credit cards is more pronounced for households with lower education levels, those without any members working in the public sector, and those without critical illness insurance. Furthermore, the use of credit cards can alleviate the negative impacts of natural disasters and critical illnesses on household finances, greatly enhancing the ability of households to withstand risks.
PurposeCost-utility analyses examining the value of new vaccines for pneumococcal disease will require health state utilities as inputs. Existing utilities for pneumococcal infections in young children are limited. The purpose of this study was to estimate health state utilities associated with pneumococcal infections in young children.MethodsSix health state vignettes depicting infections due toStreptococcus pneumoniaewere drafted based on published literature and clinician interviews. To address methodological challenges in estimating utilities for temporary infections in children 0–5 years of age, several time trade-off approaches were explored in a pilot study (N = 28 participants). In the subsequent utility elicitation study conducted in the UK, health states were valued using the best performing method from the pilot (10-year time horizon, with infections repeated annually) with adult general population respondents imagining a child 2–5 years of age.ResultsA total of 208 participants completed interviews (51.9% female; mean [SD] age = 41.0 [14.9] years). Mean (SD) utilities were 0.902 (0.092) for pneumonia requiring hospitalization, 0.901 (0.087) for bacteremia, 0.894 (0.103) for recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), 0.882 (0.107) for recurrent AOM treated with pressure equalization tubes, 0.878 (0.109) for bacteremic pneumonia, and 0.809 (0.145) for meningitis.ConclusionLower health state utilities were associated with health states that had longer treatment periods, required more invasive treatment, and described more severe infections. Utilities from this study can be used in models examining cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccines. These results have methodological implications for future research estimating utilities associated with temporary pediatric health conditions.
ObjectivesThis study aimed to replicate the evaluation findings of a youth program adopting a positive youth development (PYD) approach implemented during the pandemic years of 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 in China mainland using a validated subjective outcome evaluation (SOE) assessment tool.MethodsA 36-item SOE scale was used to investigate participants’ evaluation of the quality of the PYD program, the quality of the program implementers, and the perceived program benefits. The data were collected from 3,765 (Mage= 13.46,SD= 0.72, 50.4% females) and 2,786 (Mage= 16.24,SD= 0.68, 51.7% females) junior and senior high school students, respectively.ResultsThe SOE scale showed an invariant three-factor structure and adequate validity and reliability. Consistent with previous findings, student participants showed favorable perceptions of the youth program’s quality, the quality of the implementers, and the multifaceted benefits of project participation. In addition, senior grade students held more favorable evaluations in comparison to those of junior grade students.ConclusionIn conjunction with previous research conducted before COVID-19, the present findings support the psychometric properties of the SOE scale and the value of the PYD program across different times.
This interview article explores how British anthropologist Tim Ingold’s work can inspire innovation in mental health and the psy disciplines. Ingold critiques dominant biomedical and individualistic approaches, arguing for the importance of caring attentiveness and abolishing dichotomies like those between surface and depth, when engaging with people to understand and assist them. Instead, he suggests viewing human existence as correspondences with environmental, social, and relational others. The interview highlights the concept of “doing-undergoing,” proposing that care is a reciprocal, relational process. Ingold’s ideas suggest a shift towards practices that engage directly with the world and promote attentiveness to human and more-than-human relations. The article encourages practitioners, educators and students of mental health disciplines to rethink traditional models and adopt more humane approaches.
Performance theories treat social action as relatively improvisational, but how such spontaneous and unscripted actions manage to succeed with audiences is undertheorized. Cultural pragmatics is exceptional in this regard, specifying the elements of successful performances and placing particular emphasis on the dramatic skills of actors and the agency of audiences. But how exactly do actors make use of the active character of audiences in achieving performative success? In this article, I draw from interview and observational data on improvisational theatre to analyse and catalogue the skills and techniques that improvisers employ to engage their audiences. I find that improvisers achieve performative success consistently by exercising varying degree of “restrained reciprocity” with audiences, and developing skills and techniques to generate enthusiastic responses, make inferences about the audiences mental and emotional states, tailor performances to audience preferences, and coordinate performances with the affordances of performance venues. I use these insights to refine the conceptualization of dramatic skills, fusion, and mise-en-scène within cultural pragmatics.
In the last decade, the phenomena of using excessive credit has developed fast. Long-lasting household debt can jeopardize the personal well-being of every member of the household. Most existing research focuses on economic situations to explain the reason that households frequently use overdraft services. The aim of this study is to broaden the scope of the research of the overdraft phenomenon by building a theoretical model which integrates economic factors together with personal psychological traits and external social influence. Qualitative research was used that included in-depth interviews of 29 urban salaried employees. Results showed that economic factors were a significant contributor in explaining overdraft use. Yet social influencing factors, especially the past financial behaviour of the parents and the children’s social demands, were found to have a large effect on the tendency to use overdraft services regularly. Personality traits, mainly locus of control and self-control, added enlightenment to understanding this phenomenon. Through identification of these factors, appropriate preventive steps can be taken by institutions and individuals to reduce the use of surplus credit in ways that lead to harm to the household.
Collaborative partnerships between stakeholders in Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) settings are recognized to contribute to positive outcomes for children and improve service quality. However, for many within the field, interpretation and actualisation of the components that make up collaborative partnerships remain an enigma. The concern is that without clear interpretation of key components and inclusions, educators and families struggle to enact and engage in high-quality collaborative partnerships. Motivated by this concern, a major research project sought to explore ECEC stakeholder perspectives and experiences of successful collaborative partnerships. The poststructural case study utilised observation, interviews and situational analysis methods to illuminate the multiple truths of parent and educator participants living the collaborative partnership experience in ECEC. Findings helped expose the key components and inclusions of collaborative partnerships evidenced in threeexceeding-levelECEC service. From these insights, families and educators are offered clarity in ways to increase the efficacy for translating mechanisms of high-quality collaborative partnerships in everyday practice in ECEC, including practical applications such as the use of space, the development of synergistic relationships, and being attuned to the service philosophy.
Sustainable development is a crucial way not only of promoting the economic success of family businesses but also of ensuring their long-term stability and prosperity. As a central element of relational governance, trust plays a vital role in efforts to align the interests of principals with those of agents, and this factor has received significant attention in the context of family businesses. Stewardship theory further posits that granting agents sufficient authority and trust can effectively encourage them to engage in stewardship behaviours that are more in line with the overall interests of the organization, thus providing a new theoretical perspective on agency problems as well as a practical approach that can be used to address these issues. In traditional Chinese culture, family businesses benefit from deep-seated family values and unique relational networks, which confer on them a distinctive governance logic and a system rooted in foundational trust. On the basis of survey data collected from 281 nonfamily chief executive officers (CEOs) in China, this study empirically examines the impact of trust between controlling families (CFs) and non-family CEO (NFEs) on the sustainable development performance of family businesses. The findings of this research are as follows: (1) Trust between CFs and NFEs is developed through the exchange of economic benefits, the integration of social emotions, and the establishment of institutional structures, thus leading to three forms of trust: calculative trust, relational trust, and institutional trust. Calculative trust can inhibit the sustainable development performance of family businesses, whereas relational trust and institutional trust can enhance such performance. (2) Calculative trust reduces stewardship behaviour on the part of NFEs, thereby weakening the sustainable development performance of family businesses. Conversely, both relational trust and institutional trust can promote stewardship behaviour on the part of NFEs, thereby strengthening the firm’s sustainable development performance. This study addresses gaps in previous research on this topic and offers valuable insights that businesses can use to take advantage of trust to improve their sustainable development outcomes.
This article examines the strategies developed at the local level to strengthen pan-ethnic solidarity within Latino communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. It explores how local organizations and migrant communities may foster a pan-ethnic identity and the subsequent effects on the inclusion process of Latino immigrants with precarious legal status. Based on 87 in-depth interviews, this study offers a novel perspective on integration by focusing on intra-ethnic dynamics within Latino communities, particularly at the local level, rather than broader inter-ethnic or national contexts. The findings highlight the critical role of local contexts in shaping the mechanisms of inclusion for Latino immigrants, revealing the complexities of identity formation under conditions of legal precarity. In particular, they show how in exclusionary contexts, within-group solidarity can be built. This research contributes to broader sociological and political debates on immigrant inclusion, pan-ethnic identity formation, and the influence of local environments in these processes.
The paper analyzes current discussions concerning the so called “replicability crisis” – a notion describing difficulties in attempts to confirm existing research findings by their additional scrutiny or by new empirical studies. We propose interpretation that this “crisis” may be seen as a manifestation of the increasing inconsistency between, on the one hand, the outdated views on a human being and social structures dominating in the academic mainstream across various disciplines, including psychology and sociology, and, on the other hand, the reality of the emerging new stage of societal evolution, neo-structuration, which brings to the forefront individual agency. Our analysis suggests the possibilities for the future inter-disciplinary paradigmatic shift, which implies putting in the center of research not the idea of a constant or predictably developing individual in the context of solid external structures operating in line with a presumably sustainable “progress”. Instead, under increasing neo-structuration, individual agency becomes, simultaneously, a manifestation of the essence of human nature (as cultural psychology argues) and the driving force for societal transformations, including solving most acute social problems, in the concrete historical period. It means a fundamentally new task for social sciences and humanities: to elaborate methodological solutions and theoretical frameworks to systematically comprehend the contextually conditioned human ability to create and transform – and not only to reproduce. Addressing more attention to agency manifestations in digital environment and, in particular, to those congruent to social activism or volunteering, seems especially fruitful for comprehending human activity in the neo-structurated world.
A large body of research has evidenced different risk factors associated with the severity of gambling. However, most of the research has been conducted with a male population, and consequently it has been inferred that the female population presents the same experiences and characteristics. Research on female gamblers is limited, with the result that their gambling-related problems are not effectively addressed. In light of this, the study aims were two-fold: (1) to identify differences between Spanish and Italian women seeking treatment for a gambling disorder, and (2) to examine variables associated with gambling severity in a clinical sample of women. For this study, a total of 106 women gamblers (Mage= 48.83;SD= 12.41) completed the assessment, evaluating gambling behavior, alexithymia, hopelessness, and mental health (depression, anxiety, and hostility). Results indicated that Spanish and Italian women showed differences in sociodemographic, psychological, and gambling-related variables. Furthermore, exhibiting higher levels of depressive symptoms, and experiencing difficulties in identifying emotions were related to the increased gambling severity. Also, received the Italian intervention was related to lower gambling severity. These findings emphasize the need to provide evidence-based treatments, as well as to improve existing treatments and develop prevention and intervention strategies adapted to the characteristics of female gamblers.
Children in early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases. Therefore, the role of early childhood educators (ECEs) is crucial for infectious disease prevention (IDP). This study aimed to define and analyze ECEs’ role in IDP using the Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) method and educational needs analysis. The DACUM analysis revealed seven key duties:Routine Monitoring,Environmental Management,Education and Guidance,Administrative Responsibility,Risk Management,Self-Development, andMedication Management.Routine Monitoringemerged as a critical duty involving continuous surveillance to detect early signs of infectious diseases, indicating its importance in maintaining overall health.Environmental Managementhighlighted measures for disinfection and securing the necessary consumables, whereasEducation and Guidancefocused on developing and implementing educational activities to prevent disease spread.Administrative Responsibilitiesare required to facilitate effective communication between the ECEs and children’s families.Risk Managementranked highly in the education needs analysis and involved responding to infectious disease outbreaks by planning appropriate play activities under restrictive conditions.Self-Developmentemphasized the need for ongoing learning to ensure continued IDP in pediatric patients. Lastly,Medication Managementhighlighted the challenges faced by ECEs in administering medications and the need for clear practice guidelines. Establishing an IDP framework based on these key duties enables ECEs to integrate educational and health priorities more effectively. This framework could serve as a foundation for training programs and policy development, supporting safer learning environments and promoting children’s health and development.
This theoretical paper offers an in-depth examination of the intersection between Theory of Mind (ToM) and artificial intelligence (AI), drawing on developmental psychology and philosophical analysis. By investigating the key developmental stages at which children begin to understand that others have distinct mental states, the paper provides a framework for assessing the cognitive boundaries of AI systems. It critically interrogates the pervasive human inclination to anthropomorphize machines, particularly through the attribution of complex mental states like “knowing,” “thinking,” or “believing” to AI entities that lack subjective experience. The paper argues that AI, while capable of simulating cognitive processes, operates without the conscious awareness that defines human cognition, raising profound epistemological and ethical questions. It explores the broader implications of this projection for society, considering how our conceptualization of AI affects both technological development and social structures. Ultimately, this interdisciplinary inquiry calls for a more nuanced understanding of the distinctions between human and machine cognition, advocating for responsible approaches to AI as its capabilities evolve.
International actors have only relatively recently recognized that internal displacement is a strategy, as well as a consequence, of violent conflict, and the subject accordingly continues to give rise to a host of misinterpretations and misunderstandings, including the tendency to view it as a protection challenge, which persists despite the fact that state actors, as the supposed protectors, are also invariably the main perpetrators of displacement. This article seeks to explore and establish the ‘place’ of internal displacement in the Syrian Regime’s political and military strategy in Assad’s ongoing war on the Syrian people. It draws on an emerging literature on displacement, along with a range of reports on the Regime’s internal displacement activities in the Civil War, to propose that it needs to be engaged and understood as a rational strategy that is being applied to alter existing demographic realities. After zooming in to focus on strategic displacement in particular, it seeks to demonstrate that displacement should not just be understood in terms of its military significance, but also as a mechanism that the Regime uses to reconfigure and rearrange existing political and social realities.
Much research argues that socioeconomic status—often conceptualized as education, income, and occupation—predicts health via economic and social resources. Yet, there is relatively limited research on occupation and health. This study asks the following question: to what extent does occupation predict adult health? The study answers this question using data from employed early midlife respondents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. The analysis finds that higher occupational prestige is correlated with better physical health, mental health, and substance use outcomes. However, the results show no prestige-health associations after controlling for personal education and income. The findings reveal differences in health by occupational type. Those working in construction or production have relatively high rates of smoking and frequent binge drinking but have low BMI. Those working in transportation have relatively poor self-rated health and high rates of functional limitations but are unlikely to report using non-prescribed drugs. These results demonstrate distinct physical health and substance use patterns among specific blue-collar occupations in early midlife.
In the recent times, the role of artificial intelligence in social, economic, and environmental decision-making is important. Artificial intelligence is considered a source of enabling countries to achieve sustainable development goals. The economic consequences of the introduction of artificial intelligence are mostly overlooked and yet to be explore empirically. This work aims to empirically determine the impact of artificial intelligence on income inequality in the pioneers of the field, i.e., the G7 economies. Also, it aims to explore the role of fiscal intervention in mediating the impact of artificial intelligence on income inequality in these economies. The panel data techniques such as the test for cross sectional dependence and the test for slope heterogeneity are used. Furthermore, CIPS is used to determine the level of integration of the variables in the model. Westerlund test for cointegration and granger causality test by Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) are also used in the study. Furthermore, CSARDL technique is used to find out the impact of artificial intelligence along with control variables on income inequality. The results show that artificial intelligence reduces income inequality in the G7 both in the short and the long run. The absolute value of the long-term coefficients is larger than those in the short run. Based on the empirical findings of the work, it is recommended that appropriate fiscal interventions are needed in the short run to sustain the income inequality reduction impact of artificial intelligence. However, in the long run such interventions can be counter-productive but the requisite skills to optimally utilize artificial intelligence should be imparted to individuals.
This study aimed to examine whether fully automated and Internet-based personalized normative feedback (GAMCHECK) improves problem gambling symptoms and behaviors. We used a randomized parallel-group superiority design to examine whether GAMCHECK would be more effective than an assessment-only (AO) condition at 12-week follow-up. This study was conducted online using questionnaires and the LINE app. Participants were recruited through online surveys. All outcomes were assessed using Internet-based questionnaires. We used a linear mixed model to assess the effects of GAMCHECK on scores for the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (GSAS) as the primary outcome; secondary outcomes were the Gambling Related Cognitions Scale (GRCS), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C), number of gambling days, money spent on gambling, and help-seeking behaviors. With data from 274 participants (GAMCHECK: n = 141; AO: n = 133), we demonstrated that GAMCHECK was more effective solely on GRCS than AO at both one-week and four-week follow-up. Furthermore, by the 12-week follow-up, GAMCHECK significantly more effective than AO on gambling symptoms measured by the GSAS, number of gambling days and amount of money spent on gambling during the prior week, GRCS, and PGI-C at 12-week follow-up. No significant effects were found for help-seeking behaviors. Cognitive distortion mediated the effect on change in GSAS scores. GAMCHECK was significantly effective in improving gambling symptoms, number of gambling days, amount of money spent on gambling, and cognitive distortion. However, regarding help-seeking behavior, further refinement of GAMCHECK is necessary to motivate problem gamblers to take actions to solve their problems.
The Canadian immigration system is unique in that subnational governments play a significant role in selecting immigrants through Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs), which empower nine provinces and two territories to actively select (“nominate”) economic immigrants. Collectively, PNPs have become the country’s largest economic immigration program, but they are also the least studied, leading to a lack of understanding, transparency, and accountability. Using a subnational comparative method, this study examines 78 active subnational immigration programs (policy outputs), investigating policy design, requirements, and distribution of nominations in 2021–2022. We assess whether PNPs contribute to broader changes in the Canadian immigration regime. First, our analysis reveals the prevalence of employment-based streams and prearranged work as a selection criterion. Second, we show nuanced policy outputs in the progression toward a two-step system, with provincial variation in requirements for prior Canadian experience. Third, while PNPs are open to low-skilled workers, programs tailored exclusively to this group remain relatively limited. This comparative analysis reveals significant inter-provincial variation, and highlights the importance of a “disaggregated” evaluation of the migration state at the subnational level.
A significant portion of female neonatal, infant and child mortality could be avoided. These girls form part of the phenomenon known as missing women. Previous literature has examined whether families that prevent unwanted (female) pregnancies from reaching term provide greater care to the surviving daughters, but it reports mixed results. An avenue that has received limited attention is the possibility that explicit discrimination against girls legitimates otherwise non-realized behaviors, leading to additional fatal neglect. This paper contributes to the literature, going a step further in the causal identification of aggregate prenatal discrimination effects on postnatal discrimination by comparing the survival outcomes of brothers and sisters who were exposed to different levels of prenatal discrimination around the time of their births. The sample of siblings is reconstructed from the birth history of women in the Indian National Family Health Survey (2016–2017). Prenatal discrimination is measured by the male to female sex ratio at birth (SRB), computed by backward induction from the Census of India (2011). Results show that the greater the difference between the SRB in the birthyears of sisters and the SRB in the birthyears of brothers, the greater the difference in mortality between sisters and brothers. This finding lends support to the idea that prenatal discrimination legitimized otherwise latent discrimination. Furthermore, the excess female mortality associated with this mechanism is found in rural areas, but not in urban ones, and this relationship is more intense for infant girls born in high parities and therefore more likely to belong to families that did not resort to sex-selective abortions to control family sex-composition. This paper contributes to the problematization of the intertwining dimensions of discrimination, providing a better understanding of the missing women phenomenon.
Material deprivation captures the concrete experience of shortfalls in standard of living. Prior research on material deprivation largely focused on additive individual determinants, neglecting the multiplicative nature of demographic categorizations, limiting our understanding of material deprivation at the intersection of social attributes. Using data from the Swiss Household Panel, this study estimated the predictive power of five intersectional attributes (age, gender, education, marital status, and nationality) for deprivation in the Swiss context. Results show that educational attainment, marital status, and nationality had the strongest predictive power for deprivation. More than a third of the between‐strata variance was captured by intersectional interactions but was not explained by the additive effect of social attributes. Efforts to alleviate material deprivation would benefit from understanding the resident population’s intersectional identities for more precisely targeted interventions.
This research note estimates refined marriage rates and coresidential relationships among individuals identifying as gay, lesbian, and straight in the United States seven years after the legalization of same-sex marriage. Data to estimate refined marriage rates or coresidential relationships by sexual identity are not available in a single national dataset so we leverage data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2022 American Community Survey and Household Pulse Survey, to estimate refined marriage rates and the share in a coresidential union for straight, lesbian, and gay populations aged 18 to 64, based on the unmarried population and age. Findings highlight the importance of considering age alongside sexual identity when analyzing marital behavior and coresidential relationships. Both refined marriage rates and percentage living in coresidential relationships were lower among gay identifying males across all age groups, whereas rates among lesbian identifying females were comparable to those among straight identifying males and females. This study contributes to research on contemporary relationship dynamics as well as calling for new demographic data and investigations into the complexities of marriage and cohabitation among diverse populations.
The concept of vulnerability has become central in debates and policies around migration and asylum, but its use has been criticised as ‘individualising’ vulnerability and neglecting the socio-legal structures that promote it. However, shifting the focus on the structural determinants of vulnerability risks ignoring the agentic power and subjective conditions of individuals within a group considered vulnerable. On this backdrop, the current study proposes to focus on the phenomenological level and sets out to provide an exploratory analysis of conditions of experiential vulnerability. The study draws from 15 interviews conducted with a group of young adults who continue to live in temporary reception centres in Luxembourg despite having obtained refugee status. Integrating a conceptual model of vulnerability as embedded, multi-layered, and dynamic with insights from a critical phenomenological approach, the comparative thematic analysis identified three main elements shaping young refugees’ experiences of vulnerability: positions, interpretations and (re)actions. The conclusion discusses some limitations of the study and potential implications, focusing on the potential short and long-term impact of experiential vulnerability on migrant individual’s well-being and on society as a whole.
Even though the Central Business District (CBD) is a critical urban space, extant studies on zoning guidelines ignore the CBDs. Therefore, the extent to which collective actions in CBDs are informed by guidelines is uncertain. Using reviews, the in-depth interviews of 45 CBD users and 5 city managers, and naturalistic observations, the study explored the practices in Kumasi Central through the lens of Ghana’s CBD prescriptions. The review suggests an explicit intent for quality CBD practices per the guidelines. However, the guidelines lack the supporting standards and specifications to aid achievement. The study reveals a disconnection between the observed practices and the guidelines implying that the existence of objective guides does not automatically create the best or the conceived spatial practices. The study indicates that commercialisation without recourse to the provision of social services, land ownership challenges, outdated CBD design in the face of skyrocketing user numbers, and weak punitive measures among others define the practices in modern Central Kumasi. This implies that actions activated by user dispositions, rather than guidelines, shape the CBD’s practices. Consequently, the study recommends revising the CBD guidelines to establish a nationwide standard direction as the first step. Then, the guidelines should be decentralised to consider user preferences and district dynamics. Lastly, it is proposed that CBD redevelopment plans that employ a collaborative and participatory approach are crucial to improving Kumasi’s Central Business District. Thus, a context-driven set of guidelines co-created by governments, urban planners, academicians, traditional authorities, and all stakeholders may work best in achieving the expected spatial expression in CBDs.
In this article, the authors aim to offer a perspective on self-compassion capable of becoming part of a unified psychology; however not “from scratch”, but based on what Neff (2003a,b) proposed. This is through the analysis and refinement of her theory in two stages. First, they check whether the supposed six factors exist in the constitution of self-compassion using the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) technique in a collected sample for this study (249 participants, 69.8% women ranging in age from 18 to 65, median = 22). In the second stage, they analyze and refine Neff’s theory based on the results of the EFA, and in light of an evolutionary perspective and Aristotle’s philosophy, following, respectively, the suggestions proposed by Zagaria et al. (2020); Osmo and Borri (2024a) that aim to unify psychological science.
This study initially conducted a systematic literature review to examine gender differences in environmental orientation (EO) using the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale. Following PRISMA guidelines, 38 studies were selected from a total of 168, providing a comprehensive overview of the existing research on the topic. Based on the insights gained from the review, a large sample survey was then conducted to explore further the differences in EO between male and female consumers. The results were compared with previous studies employing similar methodologies. The central research question is: Does gender identity influence EO as measured by the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale? The NEP scale is a well-established instrument for assessing environmental attitudes. The significance of this topic lies in the potential impact of differing attitudes among gender groups on the effectiveness of communication and comprehension. Understanding these differences is crucial for developing strategies for sustainable development through targeted and effective messaging. Our findings indicate that women exhibit a higher NEP orientation, suggesting they are more aware of environmental concerns than men. The systematic review also confirmed this trend, with the majority of studies reporting higher environmental awareness among women. Additionally, women demonstrate greater awareness of related problems and a higher willingness to change their behavior to reduce their environmental impact. In contrast, men’s attitudes are more varied, reflecting a broader diversity of opinions within this group.
It is shown that unstable eigenvectors determine the manner in which the subpopulations involved in rumor spreading organize themselves when initially spreading out rumors. The corresponding amplitudes may determine temporal aspects of rumor spreading even beyond the linear domain of the eigenvector analysis. In doing so, eigenvectors and amplitudes taken together can reveal the relatively simply organization of rumor spreading. For the benchmark Daley-Kendall model it is demonstrated that the eigenvector determines the rumor spreading organization in all three fundamental cases of rumor spreading suggested by Pequeira. Moreover, the approach is applied to the Earth-is-flat rumor that circulated during spring 2017. The analysis suggests that subpopulations organization was characterized by a 21:25 ratio such that per 25 initially ignorant community members 21 spreaders occurred, a ratio that is close to the optimal 1:1 ratio that would indicate that every ignorant member turned into a spreader.
Precarity is a term capturing the migrants’ situation under globalization and migration-driven uncertainties. Many have attempted to explain the precarity in terms of employment changes, but fewer in terms of non-employment ones. A systematic review is conducted to summarize the conceptualization of migrant precarity manifested in non-employment aspects. Studies (n= 46) from 2014 to 2024 were selected by searching through social science databases of using the keyterms of “precarity” or “precarization” or “precariat” or “precariousness” AND “migrants” or “migration”. Precarity conceptualizations were compared by migrants’ narratives to identify precarity items omitted in literature. Findings showed that migrants’ precarities suffer from typical economic, social and legal precarities. Yet, precarities of household, information and housing are understudied. Moreover, analyzation of migrants’ narratives shown mismatches to scholar’s conceptualization, which reflects a need for scholars to research with the voices of migrants to rectify the conceptualization. The review also shows a socially reproduction relationship between precarities, while multidimensional conceptualizations will help scholars’ analysis to stick consistently to migrants’ experiences. It is also recommended to research more on information, housing, and psychological precarity, apart from a need to adopt longitudinal lens into migrant precarity studies. Words count for body of manuscript: 8,524 (excluding references and appendix).
Numerous policy-makers and social scientists promote flexible working as a means to reconcile work and family life, often explicitly targeting women. Accordingly, one might expect that flexible working-time arrangements are more prevalent in occupations with a high share of female employees. Yet, previous evidence indicates the opposite. To address this puzzle, we investigate the occupational opportunity structures for flexible working. A devaluation argument proposes that employers perceive female-typed work as being of lower value, thus inhibiting the provision of flexible working-time arrangements in tfemale-dominated occupations. We evaluate this argument against alternative explanations, namely differences in the ability to bargain for flexible working and in structural or practical barriers to flexible working. Descriptive results based on German panel data (GSOEP, 2003–2017) enriched with occupational-level information confirm that female-dominated occupations provide the least access to flexible work. Linear probability models with yearly fixed-effects indicate that power resources and structural barriers account for differences in flexible working between male-dominated and integrated occupations; yet an unexplained disadvantage for female-dominated occupations remains. Moreover, this disadvantage has grown between 2003 and 2017. We interpret this result as support of a cultural devaluation of female-dominated occupations in access to flexible working-time arrangements. Our findings highlight that the empirical reality of gendered occupational opportunity structures contradicts the gendered policy discourse on flexible work.
Theorists in the embedded, embodied, and enactive traditions have frequently proposed habit as a model for much or all of cognition. These proposals typically depict habit as a pervasive phenomenon with unique explanatory benefits. This paper contends, however, that the concept of habit, as applied in these debates, is more effectively understood not as a general principle explaining cognitive processes, but as an evocative picture of the mind that reorients our thinking. By examining popular self-improvement books on habits, we show that philosophical applications of ‘habit’ heavily rely on common everyday understandings of the term. We argue that this dependence casts doubt on its status as a unifying explanans. We further demonstrate that insufficient recognition of this dependence promotes a mistaken view of habits as constituting the grounds of mentality. In our conclusion, we discuss the implications of moving beyond a uniform explanatory framework for cognition, advocating for a greater emphasis on the contextual embedding of mental phenomena instead.
Gambling encompasses a wide variety of activities, and the structural characteristics of each form contribute to its potential risk. However, the literature does not fully agree on the risk levels of certain gambling forms. In this study, we classify less risky gambling forms (soft forms) based on public perceptions of their riskiness. We examine the link between gambling experience and problem gambling prevalence. A survey was conducted in a model region of the Czech Republic, a post-socialist country with high gambling availability, with N = 2,498 respondents. A typology of gambling forms (lotteries, betting, and casino games) was created based on perceived risk similarities. Lotteries are the most frequently played gambling form, with 86.3% reporting lifetime participation. Among those who exclusively engage in lottery-type forms, 15 percentage points more women than men participated in the last year, and the gap widens to 31 points over a lifetime. Forms of gambling perceived as more risky show a lower proportion of non-problem gamblers, both for recent and lifetime participation. Furthermore, individuals who gambled within the past month or year are at higher risk of developing gambling problems compared to those whose gambling experiences were less recent.
Despite the legal requirements for families to participate in the education of children with special needs, the implementation of these requirements is often inconsistent due to a lack of awareness among both families and educators. This study was conducted to critically examine the roles, challenges, and effective strategies for family involvement using Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory to explain the complex relationship between family and educational systems in supporting child development. Using a mixed-methods research design, this study combines quantitative data from a survey of 157 preschool teachers with qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 16 educators who have experience in inclusive classroom settings. Quantitative analysis showed no significant differences in the implementation of family involvement strategies based on teachers’ professional seniority or gender (p > 0.05). However, educators who implemented classroom adaptations for students with special needs showed higher levels of effective family involvement (p < 0.05). Qualitative findings identified significant barriers to family involvement, such as time constraints due to parents’ work commitments, socio-economic and educational disparities, and inadequate communication between families and schools. Educators proposed solutions, including flexible scheduling, targeted awareness initiatives, and enhanced collaboration among stakeholders to overcome these obstacles. The insights from this study are essential for policymakers, educators, and families working to create inclusive educational environments that effectively address the needs of children with special needs. Recommendations for future research include expanding the study to diverse geographic regions and educational levels and conducting a comprehensive examination of the long-term effects of family involvement on children’s academic and social outcomes, as well as on teachers’ professional development and satisfaction within inclusive education frameworks.
Exploring the nuanced and often elusive realm of pre-reflective consciousness presents a methodological challenge, as it involves capturing experiences that arise prior to reflective thought and language. This article introducesPhenomenological Mapping, an innovative research method designed to systematically study the pre-reflective dimensions of human experience. Grounded in the foundational theories of Edmund Husserl (2012), Maurice Merleau-Ponty (2013), and Martin Heidegger (1992,2008), the approach also integrates contemporary perspectives from Dan Zahavi (1999,Contemporary Phenomenology and Qualitative Research5(1), 1–17,2021), Shaun Gallagher (2006,2017), and Evan Thompson (2010,2017). Drawing upon advancements in neurophenomenology, embodied cognition, and intersubjectivity, Phenomenological Mapping provides a structured framework for accessing and analyzing pre-reflective consciousness. This methodology guides researchers through a sequence of eleven phases, from initial preparation and contextualization to data collection, analysis, and integration. It employs Husserl’s phenomenological reduction, Merleau-Ponty’s concept of embodied perception, and Heidegger’s exploration of being-in-the-world. The approach is further enriched by Zahavi’s intersubjectivity, Gallagher’s work on embodiment, and Thompson’s continuum of consciousness. By utilizing multisensory data collection techniques—such as visual diaries, audio recordings, and experiential practices—Phenomenological Mapping offers a multi-dimensional approach to analyzing subjective experience. This research contributes a novel methodological tool to phenomenology, facilitating an empirical investigation that remains faithful to the philosophical foundations of pre-reflective consciousness while bridging empirical and theoretical domains.
The present paper treats the issue of methodological assumptions in mainstream neuropsychology and, as counter-concepts, in Vygotsky’s approach and Holzkamp’s critical psychology. The analysis identifies four main assumptions concerning the methodology of mainstream neuropsychology, which are contrasted with the positions of other approaches. The methodologies of the mainstream neuropsychology vs. Holzkamp’s and Vygotsky’s approach assume: (1) mechanistic vs. dialectical materialism; (2) formal vs. dialectical logic; (3) decomposition into elements vs. units; (4) reductionism of psychic processes to the brain vs. activity as a unity of environmental and organism-pole. Despite the vast coincidence in their main assumptions, we also discuss nuances of difference between Holzkamp’s and Vygotsky’s approaches. The former, possibly due to its reference to cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) and its theoretical neglection of the organism-pole of psychic functions, falls short of structural considerations in its accounts on phylogenetic emergence. On the other hand, Vygotsky’s neuropsychology does not fully explore the phylogenetic emergence of basic units of functional psychic organisation. This might be due to certain implications of Vygotsky’s initial accounts, which seem to highlight cultural development to the detriment of phylogenetic one.
The paper critically analyses cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) in two most important aspects - the basic unit of analysis (i.e., in essence, the subject of the theory) and the main epistemological and methodological principles. It is shown with several examples that the concepts and principles that CHAT took from Vygotsky’s theory are absent in Vygotsky’s theory and are ascribed to him by misunderstanding and misinterpretation. One may agree or disagree that cultural-historical theory and activity theory are different theories, despite their historical connections, but Leontiev’s theory has no activity (and the concept of activity! ) as a unit of analysis, because the principle of the unity of consciousness and activity theory represents a completely different logic of analysis, which does not need units of analysis at all.
The majority of youth who experience foster care want to go to college. Unfortunately, few achieve their post-secondary goals. Many states have developed programs and policies to increase the level of support available to students who have experienced foster care (SEFC). However, most of these initiatives have not been evaluated. The present study examines two emergent strategies in Texas; a) an unfunded legislative mandate to appoint a liaison on every college/university campus to serve SEFC and, b) a grassroots movement to develop campus support programs for SEFC at particular institutions.  We evaluate these programs and policies using a unique data set that merges historical data from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, academic records from the Texas Higher Education Board, and primary data collected from campus websites and liaison surveys. Our data from 2012–2021 revealed that retention rates for SEFC did not increase in association with the liaison legislation. However, our analysis from the 2020–2021 academic year revealed that students who attended four-year universities with a campus support program had significantly higher retention rates than students who attended comparable schools without these programs (41% higher). However, we did not find a benefit of campus support programs for students attending community colleges. We conclude that higher education support can improve retention rates of SEFC. However, success is not guaranteed, but rather is contingent on funding, execution, and context. We call for ongoing assessment of existing strategies in order to identify best practices for improving post-secondary outcomes of SEFC.
Donald Black created a purely sociological theory that explained social life without reference to psychology, biology, or individual persons as such. Granting that he succeeded, and that his theories have value, we can revisit the question of interdisciplinary work. Does pure sociology have implications for psychology, biology, or the study of individual persons as such? Here I suggest several ways in which Blackian theory and the Blackian paradigm can guide work in other fields, including applications in social psychology, to the study of personality and perception, to the field of ethology, and finally to evolutionary biology. Black’s pure sociology offers important insights and new directions even for those who are not themselves pure sociologists.
The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to numerous conspiracy theories, focusing on topics such as vaccine effectiveness, the virus’s origin and public health measures. These narratives have spread rapidly through social and traditional media, influencing public perception and behaviour towards vaccination efforts. In particular, they have contributed significantly to vaccine hesitancy. This study focuses on Italy, where narratives linking COVID-19 vaccinations to sudden deaths have gained significant traction. By conducting a thorough investigation into post-vaccination mortality rates, this study aims to shed light on the true nature of the data regarding deaths and mortality rates in Italy. The study uses a Difference-In-Differences (DID) framework to analyse post-vaccination mortality rates across Italian municipalities from 2018 to 2023. Results indicate that the overall mortality rate did not significantly increase following the vaccination campaign, and the impact varied across different demographic groups and regions, indicating disparities in healthcare delivery, public health strategies and demographic factors between the North and the South. This study contributes innovatively by providing empirical evidence from Italy, addressing a critical gap in understanding the relationship between vaccination and public health outcomes.
Male victimhood ideology, the belief that men are the primary targets of gender discrimination, has gained traction among young men in recent years, but the underlying sources of these sentiments remain understudied. Utilizing four different datasets, collected in 2015, 2018, 2020, and 2023 from representative samples of Korean men, this study investigates whether identification with male victimhood ideology is explained by objective economic hardships faced by men or by their perceptions of a status loss. The economic hardship perspective finds little support, as men who were less educated, had lower incomes, were unemployed, or had non-regular employment were no more likely to identify with male victimhood than their more economically stable counterparts. Instead, a perceived decline in socioeconomic status relative to one’s parents emerged as a significant predictor of male victimhood ideology, particularly among men from middle to upper class backgrounds. Additional analyses show that this pattern is not observed among Korean women of the same age group. Overall, the analysis of the four datasets consistently shows that male victimhood discourse is embraced most by those who perceive a loss of privilege, rather than by those who are marginalized.
The contemporary tendency of states to admit or reject migrants based on their economic utility has been documented by many sociologists and other social science researchers. However, few sociologists have critically analyzed the theoretical underpinnings with which they themselves tend to approach migratory phenomena. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the economistic bias at the heart of the sociology of migration, and to present its downsides. Starting with a case study —the sociology of migration in Quebec, Canada —the article shows how this bias tends to structure the framing of the social phenomenon of migration. The article then presents the main pitfalls of such an economistic bias for sociological thought: the neglect of emigration contexts; the dispossession of agentivity in migrant people; and the renewal of an ethnocentric and neocolonialist analysis of migration. The article concludes with two suggestions for de-economicizing the sociology of migration.
To produce a theoretical approach about the relations between neuroscience and psychopathology that expands beyond the biomedical model to include a non-reductionist, enactive, and biocultural perspective. An integrative review, drawing from thebiocultural approachfrom Anthropology, is used to produce examples from epigenetics, neuroplasticity, and functional neuroanatomy. A biocultural approach points to a brain that is highly plastic, reinforcing a much more complex model in which biological vulnerabilities and the historical-cultural environment co-construct each other. The examples given seem to point to the pressing need for a critical expansion of reductionist models of psychopathology. Importantly, the cultural-historical environment to which we refer is not a set of neutral social relations to which individuals are homogeneously exposed, such that aspects that are usually studied under the social determinants of health and disease (poverty, discrimination, violence, and other factors that represent sources of control, production, and distribution of material resources, ideology, and power) need to be incorporated in adequate biopsychosocial models of mental distress.
The development of social activities specifically tailored for older adults needs to be grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the effects of these activities from multiple perspectives. The present study applies thematic analysis to examine experts’ views and experiences regarding the effects of social activities on older people of different ethnic backgrounds and various abilities in Russia. The results suggest that participation in such activities benefits the everyday personal development of older participants. The experts involved in organising and developing social activities also noted that family relationships may be enhanced through the participation of older adults due to changes in their lifestyles, opportunities to fulfil new social roles and related improvements in communication between family members. Social activities not only address stereotypes about older adults’ abilities but also affect the understanding of mature beauty in new ways while creating a more fulfilling environment for older people by better meeting their interests and needs. Regardless of the specific activity, older people’s participation facilitates the transmission of culture and traditions across generations, cultivates an image of older adults as valuable sources of information and provides a more comprehensive and inclusive conceptualisation of ageing within society. The experts who were interviewed for this study recommended that decisions about developing social activities be madewith older adultsrather than without considering their opinions, supporting horizontal connections and allowing the heterogeneity of older adults.
To reduce reliance on solid biomass wood, particularly high in developing countries, clean fuel initiatives such as LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) are receiving increasing attention. Researchers have analyzed the relationship between access to LPG and continued use of solid biomass fuels under the assumption that access to firewood is easy and free, leading to continued reliance on firewood, a phenomenon known as fuel stacking. However, environmental regulations in some developing countries are changing, and making access to firewood difficult. I focus on fuel stacking under a rural LPG scheme in Bhutan with access to firewood governed by an annual subsidized quota system. I also examine the benefits of time saved from faster cooking with LPG and increased expenditure on electricity through detailed data on firewood consumption, time spent cooking, and energy expenditures on electricity. Data were collected from 176 households from 19 remote villages in Bhutan during four different seasons between 2018 and 2020. I found that rural households use different cooking fuels simultaneously, indicating a continued use of fuelwood and electricity even when LPG is accessible. Results indicate that LPG schemes directed at rural households are not effective in reducing dependence on fuelwood even with the introduction of a subsidized quota system, but rather incentivize fuel stacking.
BackgroundDespite advances in transplant procedures, children and adolescents still face some challenges post-transplant and are at high risk for psychiatric, academic, and social problems. This study aims to explore the lived experiences of adolescent kidney transplant recipients through interviews and the use of mandala art therapy.MethodsThis study adopted a descriptive phenomenological design and thematic analysis approach based on Husserl’s philosophy. The sample included kidney transplant recipients aged 12–18 years admitted to the pediatric nephrology polyclinic of a university hospital in southern Türkiye. Data were collected through in-depth interviews conducted during a mandala art activity with 14 adolescent kidney transplant recipients. The qualitative data were analyzed using Colaizzi’s seven-stage qualitative analysis method, which is suitable to the descriptive phenomenological design employed in the present study.ResultsFour themes and seven subthemes emerged from the data related to the problems and experiences of adolescents with kidney transplantation and growing up with a new kidney. (1) Education, (2) Ideas about the kidney; including the sub-themes “What the kidney transplant process gave them,Feelings about their kidneys”, (3) Family; including the sub-themes “Relationship with the donor,Relationship with siblings”, (4) Social environment; including the sub-themes “Experiences with hospital,Relationship with friends and Desire for friendship with a transplanted Peer”.ConclusionMandala art therapy-assisted interviews are an effective communication method for adolescent kidney transplant recipients to express their feelings and thoughts and to look at life from a broader perspective. Understanding the life experiences of adolescents with kidney transplantation and the difficulties they face may enable better and more systematic planning of the care to be given to them.
The aim of the current study is to better understand how financial cybercriminal networks recruit co-offenders. We address important knowledge gaps, as not much is known about pathways into cybercrime due to a lack of research. More knowledge can be used in practice in the context of cybercrime offender prevention. For these purposes, we analyzed 15 closed police investigations into cybercriminal networks from the Netherlands, in accordance with the approach of the Dutch Organized Crime Monitor. This is a valuable and well-established research methodology to study criminal activities of which little is known. Analysis revealed that core members need a variety of co-offenders to successfully commit financial cybercrimes such as phishing and online consumer fraud. These co-offenders can be categorized as professional facilitators, recruited facilitators, and money mules. They were approached on social media, especially on Telegram and Snapchat, as well as in the physical world. Some were promised a financial reward and were actually paid out the money, but others were manipulated and possibly forced to cooperate under threats of violence. It was not always necessary for cybercriminal networks to actively reach out, as co-offenders also found their way to the network. Taken together, our study indicates there are various offline and online pathways into cybercrime, and that cybercrime offenders apply different strategies to recruit co-offenders.
Can the fraught relation between disability and aging ever become untangled? What is the place of the catastrophically disabled in a time when giving voice and being seen are significant lodestars of political activism? And what becomes of the caregivers, who often labor in silence, and who hope to work well enough just to get through another day? This essay draws on the memoirs of Simone de Beauvoir, Annie Ernaux, Amy Bloom, and my own experiences to show the complicated imbrications of age, disability, and caretaking. I attempt to demonstrate through these experiences that age and disability, which appear to be intimately woven together, are oftentimes misleadingly connected. I suggest that an ethic of vulnerability, rather, is a more useful heuristic that avoids collapsing the categories of age and disability together. Nevertheless, these reflections inevitably lead to a discussion of death and the choices, policies, and other care structures (un)available for persons who sometimes desire to make significant decisions about ending their life when confronted with the possibility of terminal and catastrophic mental and bodily decline. Finally, I suggest that these relationships and the decisions about (end of life) care must be understood to be ambiguous and require a deep reciprocity of care based upon love, sympathy, and respect.
While most research on social media use and health behavior focuses on non-problematic use, studies specifically examining problematic social media use (PSMU) are scarce. Existing research often investigates only one health behavior at a time, leaving a gap in understanding the broader relationship between PSMU and multiple health behaviors across various contexts. This study aimed to explore the association between PSMU and adolescent health behaviors using an exploratory specification curve analysis (SCA) approach. This approach applies SCA in an exploratory manner and, in contrast to the original approach, explicitly includes non-equivalent specifications. We analyzed data from 188,175 adolescents (aged 11–15 years) across 43 countries from the 2018 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey. Three SCAs were conducted, with different health behaviors (i.e., substance use, physical activity, and dietary intake) as outcomes. Specifications varied by the operationalization of dependent variables, the inclusion of potential confounders (age, relative family affluence), and gender and country subsets. Most specifications indicated a significant relationship between PSMU and health behaviors: 97% showed a positive association with substance use, 78% a negative association with physical activity, and 92% a negative association with healthy dietary intake. The combination of country subsets and outcome variables explained a considerable portion of effect variation across all three SCAs. The findings suggest that PSMU is associated with detrimental health behaviors in adolescence, a critical period for forming lifelong health patterns.
In recent years, digital technologies have become an essential part of our lives. At the same time, the well-being of the elderly has raised great concern in developed countries due to the ageing of the population. In this context, our paper seeks to link these two issues by analysing the relationship between digital technologies and the well-being of the elderly, taking into account that the use of the former is endogenous. Such an issue has been little addressed in the literature. For this purpose, we use microdata from the European Social Survey since it includes both measures of individuals’ subjective level of well-being and of their use of the internet. We focus on Spain because it is a rapidly aging country, which also has the highest life expectancy in the European Union. Our main findings show that using internet daily is negatively associated with individuals’ happiness, but we observe a positive relationship between internet use and their social life. Additionally, these associations are enhanced for individuals aged over 60 years.
PurposeThis study aims to explore how mindfulness contributed to the flow exnperience in high-pressure situations during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly in challenging contexts like emergencies. The authors seek to enhance our understanding of experiencing flow at work, particularly during the COVID-19 crisis, when challenges became hindrance demands. Prior to investigating the potential processes and mechanisms in this association, the study also explores the mediating role of two variables: psychological capital and coping competence.MethodThe initial study population comprised all (N= 550) emergency center employees in Mashhad, Iran. Employing simple random sampling and the Morgan table, a 220-person sample was selected. Data analysis used AMOS and SPSS software alongside a structural equation model.ResultThe study confirmed the relationship between mindfulness and coping skills but did not confirm the relationship between mindfulness and flow via coping skills. However, it did confirm that mindfulness is associated with flow through psychological capital.ConclusionThe study enhances our comprehension of flow in high-risk work environments where challenges are not motivational. The authors explored flow experience in a work setting with hindrance demands, unlike previous studies focusing on flow in challenging and motivating contexts like sports (e.g., mountain climbing, surfing). Past research lacks a consensus on the relation between mindfulness and flow experience, leaving room for future exploration. Furthermore, the interplay between mindfulness, psychological capital, and coping competence as mediators in this relationship remains unexplored in prior studies.
Affective polarization is on the rise. Increasing polarization is often attributed to the nature of political discussion on social media platforms, but little is known about the affective consequences of the incivility of online discussion. This study adopts a trust game to consider whether people punish the incivility of both out-partisans and co-partisans and whether there are gender-related differences in punishment. It also examines whether incivility can have spillover effects on broader out-party hostility. Five pre-registered hypotheses are tested using a pair of survey experiments fielded to a sample (N= 974) of adult Canadian partisans. We find that participants punish the incivility of co-partisans but not out-partisans. However, incivility may spill over and heighten hostility towards out-parties more generally. Finally, we do not find evidence that women are more likely to be punished for incivility. Our findings highlight significant nuance with respect to the effects of incivility on trust and affective polarization, as well as the expectations of civility people hold for individuals online.
The paper shows how important it is to consider the requirement level when measuring mismatch unemployment. While the mismatch between occupations decreases over time, the imbalances in the distribution of unemployed workers and vacant jobs across requirement levels increased, which, in sum, led to a stagnation of mismatch on the combined occupation-requirement level. Furthermore the paper shows that mismatch unemployment emerges especially at the level of un- and semi-skilled activities, as there is excess supply regardless of the occupations. And, more importantly, the excess supply is rising recently.
There has been increased attention on teachers’ use of exclusionary discipline with the youngest learners in elementary schools; however, little is known about early childhood teachers’ use of particular discipline practices and social emotional supports. The present study reports results from a survey of 936 teachers working in elementary schools in preschool through second grade classrooms regarding their use of discipline practices and social emotional supports. We found that teachers across grade levels used several positive social emotional teaching supports and overall reported a low use of harsh discipline practices such as suspension and expulsion. However, teachers reported using some exclusionary discipline practices, such as timeout, especially in kindergarten. Several social emotional supports were not well-utilized especially in early elementary grades. Findings are discussed in the context of supporting teachers to use recommended and supportive practices with young children across the early grades.
Despite the critical role of clinicians in facilitating access to healthcare by transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people, their insight and practice-based knowledge have been underresearched. Also, they may complement TGD people's experiences by giving an insider perspective. This exploratory qualitative study, conducted online in a sample of 25 clinicians who work with TGD people (n = 11 clinical sexologists), explores how clinicians working with TGD people in Portugal perceive healthcare provision to TGD people, using a summative content analysis. Results showed that clinicians perceive their role to be all-encompassing, ranging from helping to cope with individual and interpersonal issues, and to cope with other health services. Participants highlighted the increase of TGD people’s visibility, awareness, and scientific knowledge, albeit more is needed as evidenced by several challenges derived from clinicians (e.g., lack of national guidelines, lack of training for standardized care, and lack of professional skills) and from the TGD clients (e.g., unrealistic expectations and lack of compliance). The proposed solutions include increasing the investment in specialized training and human resources, raising awareness within the healthcare system, and increasing interdisciplinary specialized care. Clinicians specialized in clinical sexology highlighted changes in scientific knowledge, more available evidence, and a need for socio-political changes and awareness raising. This study reveals that healthcare providers are self-critical but also reflect upon the difficulties of navigating between organizational, human, and personal constraints, claiming that to provide better healthcare there, policymakers must take concerted measures that can have a social impact.
We study the association between caregiving demands and psychological distress using data on 538 employed parents in the United States from the 2016 wave of the National Study of the Changing Workforce. Despite prior evidence on the relationship between caregiving demands and psychological distress, less is known about what type of caregiving demands matter, and under what conditions these demands matter. With that in mind, this study extends prior research by considering elder care, along with different types of child care (such as typical and exceptional child care), into the discussion of caregiving demands and its relationship with psychological distress. Moreover, we test whether this association is moderated by employed parents’ level of work-role salience. Results show that working parents with exceptional child care demands and those with both elder care and child care demands (i.e., sandwich generation care demands) report higher levels of psychological distress than do those with only typical child care demands. In addition, work-role salience moderates the association between having sandwich generation care demands and psychological distress. Further, the moderating effect of work-role salience is significantly stronger for working mothers than for working fathers.
Executive function encompasses various cognitive skills that govern our thoughts and actions when completing a task. The skills include self-regulation, memorisation, and cognitive flexibility to ultimately foster autonomy, planning, and problem solving skills. Various interventions have been used to develop executive function skills; however, the use of structured play has not been adequately assessed. Therefore, this qualitative study explored how the development of executive function skills can be supported in preschool settings using structured play. Since acquiring new knowledge and skills is particularly effective during social interaction, Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory was the conceptual framework. A qualitative approach was deemed the most suitable choice as it relied on direct observation of the phenomenon. Eight South African preschool teachers were selected from four preschools with different curricula (National Curriculum Framework, Independent School Association of South Africa curriculum, Montessori, and Reggio Emilia). Research data was obtained using semi-structured interviews and lesson observations. The data was then analysed and coded to arrive at six themes. The themes include: (1) guiding, (2) modelling, (3) instructing, (4) repeating, (5) incorporating child-led activities, and (6) considering children’s interests. Overall, the data supported active engagement through social experiences as a route to develop executive function skills. Given the psychosocial benefits of acquiring executive function skills at an early age, the contribution of this study suggests that play-based strategies are effective in enhancing executive function skills. These strategies are applicable in different learning environments.
Globally, the number of immigrants keeps growing. More and more people leave their familiar places to seek a new life, and each of them carries their own story of migration. While a macro view is crucial in understanding migrations, the value of those individual stories has been recognized, but not enough. This autoethnography shares a story of the transformation of an East Asian female educator who migrated to the United States. Her transformation—from an apologetic and quiet East Asian woman with a “culturally surrendered mindset” into a proud advocator of multilingual children’s language rights—is analyzed with the notion ofConocimientoby Gloria Anzaldua.Conocimientois a process of reaching enlightenment by recognizing and accepting ourselves as we are and connecting with others. Reflecting the spirit ofConocimiento, the study ends with a calling to fellow immigrants to rethink their self-identity and to be proud of who they are.
PurposeBookmarking is a qualitative method used to assign descriptive labels to ranges of patient-reported outcome (PROM) scores. We aimed to evaluate variability between bookmarking samples and test score ranges where there was variability in expert opinion in previous studies.MethodsWe conducted two bookmarking sessions with patients who experienced orthopaedic fractures (n= 11) and one session with orthopaedic clinicians (n= 10). Participants reviewed vignettes comprised of PROM items and responses that represented hypothetical patients with a range of severity. Vignettes were constructed for PROMIS Upper Extremity Function, Physical Function, and Pain Interference measures. Participants placed bookmarks between vignettes that reflected different levels of severity (e.g., mild, moderate). The score reflecting the midpoint between vignettes was used as the recommended threshold between categories. We evaluated the variability in thresholds across participants, bookmarking panels, and previous studies.ResultsAlthough patients and clinicians were not unanimous, the majority agreed on thresholds separating levels of severity for PROMIS Upper Extremity (≥40 = within normal limits, 30–39 = mild, 23–29 = moderate, < 23 = severe), PROMIS Physical Function (≥46 = within normal limits, 38–45 = mild, 26–37 = moderate, < 26 = severe), and PROMIS Pain Interference (≤50 = within normal limits, 51–60 = mild, 61–68 = moderate, > 68 = severe).ConclusionTesting new vignette scores within the same patient population enables more nuanced testing of score ranges without clear consensus and provides additional evidence for recommending thresholds for severity categories. These thresholds can be utilized to help interpret PROMIS scores from patients receiving orthopaedic care.
Given disruptions to early care and education following the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to mitigate long-term impacts of the pandemic on child development among ethnic and racial minority children. Our team is implementing an early childhood mental health consultation (ECMHC) model, or a multi-tiered intervention to support young children’s social-emotional development, that utilizes mental health consultants to deliver a virtual toolkit to ethnically and racially diverse early care and education centers. Understanding the perspectives and ongoing needs of center directors, teachers, and parents is critical to intervention delivery. Between February and April 2023, 18 participants (n= 6 center directors,n= 6 teachers,n= 6 parents) across 12 early childcare centers completed individual interviews in English or Spanish. We used a rapid qualitative analysis to generate four themes related to participants’ perceived impact of COVID-19, including how it (1) exacerbated existing financial and administrative challenges, (2) increased their need for adaptability, (3) highlighted the importance of support for staff facing educational challenges during a public health emergency, and (4) highlighted the value of partnerships between parents and centers. We generated five additional themes specific to participants’ ongoing needs and suggestions, including (1) increased financial support, (2) outside behavioral support, (3) enhanced center staff self-care, (4) balancing in-person interaction with planned virtual delivery, and (5) use of existing smartphone applications for communication with parents. In addition to informing adaptations to our model, including expanding upon program pillars (e.g., expanding our safety planning pillar to include financial safety via linkages to community resources), these data may be used to inform the delivery of other ECMHC programs for diverse populations.
In rapidly developing urban areas, land use changes frequently occur in conjunction with population growth. The determination of the existing land use structure via traditional methods, including field studies and remote sensing techniques, is an exceedingly time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive process. To address this issue, this paper proposes an innovative model based on Point of Interest (POI) data, Thiessen polygons and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the process of identifying land use functions. The model’s workflow comprises data collection, spatial geodatabase design, data pre-processing, the construction of geoprocessing workflows with ModelBuilder, analysis, urban function identification, and model verification steps. This study employs Thiessen polygons to analyze the topological and spatial relationships among 127,265 geotagged POIs in Ankara, the capital of Türkiye. The model achieved a Kappa value of 0.82 and an overall accuracy of 84.5%, demonstrating a high level of reliability. Following this analysis, functional density ratios were calculated based on the distribution of POIs to identify areas characterized by either dominant or mixed land use. The proposed methodology is expected to contribute significantly to urban planning efforts by providing insights into the utilization patterns of urban land. Furthermore, this model has the potential to function as a decision support system, aiding city planners in the effective management and development of urban spaces by delineating existing functional areas.
This study aims to explore the lived experiences of South Sudanese refugees in White Nile state, Sudan, focusing on the impact of pre-refugee life, war-related trauma, and current camp conditions on their mental health. Additionally, it aims to emphasize the strategies used by refugees to cope with challenges and highlight deficiencies in services offered by humanitarian agencis. The study used a qualitative analysis approach and conducted in-depth interviews with 15 refugees from South Sudan residing in White Nile State refugee camps in Sudan. Participants were recruited from the two refugee camps, ensuring diversity in age and gender. All focus group discussions were audio-recorded, and detailed transcripts were generated. The transcribed data were subjected to thematic analysis. The investigation revealed a number of patterns. First, participants recalled a pre-refugee life marked by safety, joy, and community cohesion, which sharply contrasted with their subsequent experiences of violence and displacement. Furthermore, refugees have conveyed substantial psychological distress resulting from their exposure to violence, suffering physical mistreatment, and the loss of their dear ones. These experiences have left profound psychological trauma and feelings of anxiety. Furthermore, the existing circumstances in the refugee camps intensified their psychological distress, as they faced challenges in having access to basic needs, job, schooling, and preserving their cultural traditions. Coping strategies of the refugees predominantly relied on cultural practices, family support, and religious prayer. By incorporating refugees’ resilience and community engagement as factors that promote long-term stability in South Sudanese refugee communities, this study underscores the urgent need for humanitarian organizations to redesign a more holistic approach that includes immediate mental health needs, socioeconomic factors, educational accessibility, and gainful employment. Ultimately, this study advocates a paradigm shift in humanitarian efforts to prioritize mental health services for refugees by addressing the interlinked nature of mental health and broader socioeconomic factors.
Urban blight has become a pressing concern for cities across the globe. The presence of blight leads to functional, social, and economic depreciation, lowering community wellbeing and quality of life. Due to the dynamic nature of this phenomenon, policies formulated to counter blight often prove to be ineffective in addressing place-based urgencies in the affected areas. Existing guidelines and frameworks have often failed to empirically identify blighted regions and ascertain the conditions of affected areas. This research seeks to address this prevalent gap in the literature by proposing a Composite Urban Blight Identification and Evaluation Index. By employing the coupling coordination method, this research developed an index for quantitative evaluation of urban blight based on identified criteria. The proposed index was applied to analyze and determine the state of blight in five selected wards of Kolkata, India, demonstrating its reliability. This research makes an important contribution to the existing body of knowledge and can aid decision-makers in the pragmatic formulation of solutions for alleviating urban blight.
During the economic lockdown following the outbreak of COVID-19, the demand for unpaid work at home increased. Drawing on gender theory and the time availability explanation, this article explores the way changes in family and work arrangements altered the division of housework and care work in a highly gendered society; Palestinian-Arab dual-earner families in Israel. In-depth interviews with 28 Palestinian-Arab women were conducted to explore the social forces underlying the gendered aspects of family-work arrangements in Palestinian-Arab families in Israel during the pandemic. The findings provide evidence that both undoing and doing gender are observed, with the latter prevailing, leading to an intensification of gender inequalities. This suggests that changes in time availability do not guarantee an egalitarian division of unpaid work because cultural models are the main drivers, emphasizing the cultural context’s importance in understanding the way families arrange their household demands.
We introduce a novel, policy-relevant measure of multidimensional empowerment based on the Alkire-Foster method and using data from partnered women aged 15–49 in 45 low- and middle-income countries: the Multidimensional Women’s Empowerment Index (MWEI). Our measure identifies a woman as empowered if she achieves sufficiency in at least six of its eight indicators, corresponding to four basic life domains in which women can exercise power: health, material environment, social relationships, and physical integrity. We find that in only 21 countries of our sample, the percentage of multidimensionally empowered women exceeds 50%, with countries like Mali reaching just 7.5%. Urban regions show higher MWEI values than rural regions in 37 countries. Insufficiency in physical integrity contributes up to 39% to the lack of empowerment in Papua New Guinea but only 15% in Burkina Faso, illustrating how the composition of disempowerment significantly varies across countries.
This study investigates conspiracy theories on China’s Weibo regarding the Russo-Ukrainian War, with a specific focus on the roles and impacts of different types of accounts (official verified accounts, individual verified accounts, and ordinary personal accounts) in these discussions. Employing structural topic modeling (STM) and qualitative text analysis, the study comprehensively analyzes Weibo posts from March 1, 2022, to October 21, 2023, aiming to unveil the thematic characteristics, construction motives, and their manifestations in the social media context of conspiracy theories. The findings reveal that the content of conspiracy theories primarily revolves around three aspects: conspiracies directly related to the war itself, nationalist narratives, and geopolitical discourse. These themes not only reflect the public’s primary narratives of conspiracy theories about the Russo-Ukrainian War but also unveil the motives for constructing and disseminating these theories. Notably, different types of social media accounts display distinct understandings and focal points regarding the nature and themes of conspiracy theories. This study offers a new perspective on the dissemination of conspiracy theories in regulated media environments, with particular attention to the Global South. In these contexts, state-led communication strategies and social media governance contribute to the formation of public discourse.
Equality of opportunity (EOp) is a broad category of egalitarian theories that has attracted considerable attention in recent decades. Empirical implementations of EOp primarily focus on the explained component of inequality, classifying determinants of the outcome (e.g., health) intoeffort—legitimate causes of inequality—andcircumstance—illegitimate causes of inequality. Largely overlooked is unexplained variation, which in statistical analysis manifests as residuals and is often ignored as a statistical annoyance. The true random component of residuals is now often referred to asluck. In this paper, we propose theplaying fieldframework that serves as a pragmatic test as to whether residuals signal unfairness in empirical EOp analyses and that enables empirical explorations of roles of luck within the EOp framework. Using a large sample of Canadian older adults, our empirical application of the playing field framework shows that distributions of residuals are not always fair, though there is no consistent pattern of unfairness across age-sex groups. The paper’s three main conclusions are: luck matters; luck should be explicitly incorporated in the EOp framework through the brute luck-effort characterization; and residuals are not just an innocuous statistical annoyance but can represent unfair inequality, and ignoring them can underestimate unfair inequality.
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health concern, causing 1.5 million deaths annually. We conducted an ecological analysis to examine TB prevalence in Brazil from 2018 to 2022, focusing on its relationship with the Human Development Index (HDI) and its inequality-adjusted version HDI (IHDI). We determined significant correlation between HDI and TB prevalence for the period of 2018–2021 (P= 0.044 in 2018,P= 0.041 in 2019,P= 0.044 in 2020, andP= 0.043 in 2021). However, an unexpected rise in TB cases in 2022, despite an increase in HDI, disrupted this trend (P= 0.12), indicating additional influencing factors. The IHDI showed correlation with TB prevalence, underscoring the importance of addressing socio-economic inequalities. These findings suggest the need for targeted interventions, particularly for vulnerable populations.
This study explores the regulatory debate and outcomes of the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 crisis to shed light on the factors influencing accounting regulation responses to global crises. Through the theoretical lens of the regulatory space, it examines the discourse and responses of the regulatory actors in their efforts to address these crises in relation to the application of IFRS within the EU. By means of a two-step analysis of multiple public sources, we find that crisis outcomes resulted from several factors and their interactions, including the characteristics of the crises and political dimensions, such as interorganizational linkages among space participants. The 2008 financial crisis sparked a vigorous debate, leading to technical and political consequences in the short and long term. Conversely, regulatory space participants demonstrated a cooperative approach during the COVID-19 crisis, recommending flexibility in the application of existing standards. This study provides insights into the accounting consequences of crises by elucidating path dependency in both the accounting standards and political realms. Thus, it emphasizes the importance of a nuanced examination of technical and political consequences in standard setting, as well as their time horizons.
Computational thinking CT is central to computer science, yet there is a gap in the literature on the best ways to implement CT in early childhood classrooms. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how early childhood teachers enacted asset-based pedagogies while implementing CT in their classrooms. We followed a group of 28 early childhood educators who began with a summer institute and then participated in multiple professional learning activities over one year. Examining a subset of the larger group, findings illustrate how teachers intentionally created learning communities that empowered students and utilized their expertise to guide CT learning in their classrooms. Teachers recognized that asset-based approaches to CT instruction empowered not just their students but also themselves. By using asset-based CT pedagogies, early childhood teachers can better support students from marginalized communities, reducing achievement gaps and inequities in digital learning.
Air pollution has been linked to various health problems in children, including respiratory and neurological issues. Existing research has also found that exposure to air pollution can affect children's cognitive ability and academic performance, with some studies showing a decrease in test scores and grade point averages associated with increased exposure to hazardous air pollution. This study examined the association between air pollution and children’s academic performance in Chile. This research addressed a critical gap in the literature by providing data from an understudied context and tracking children's academic performance at an individual level over time. We constructed a panel dataset that followed students from 1st to 8th grade and estimated their exposure to PM2.5, based on the distance of their school to air monitoring stations from elementary to middle school. We tracked students' academic performance using a longitudinal fixed-effects regression model to assess the relationship between their grade point average (GPA) and air pollution. The results revealed that, on average, an increase in the percentage of days exceeding different official air quality standards significantly affected students' annual GPA. The study also showed that academic performance among students from families with lower economic resources is disproportionately affected by air pollution. The findings underscore the pressing issue of environmental justice, highlighting that numerous students attend schools in the unhealthy environments of several Chilean cities that frequently bear the burden of socioeconomic disadvantage.
This article delves into the psychological framework of Busemann, focusing on the core principles of balance, character, autonomy and dialogue. It emphasizes how these concepts contribute to the development of personality, the dynamic process of becoming a fully realized individual. According to Busemann, personality evolves through the interaction of personal dispositions, talents, and character, with dialogue playing a crucial role in fostering growth. The paper also examines the phenomenon ofGeborgenheit, understood as a sense of security and inner stability, within this theoretical context.Geborgenheitis framed as an advanced psychological need that emerges once basic needs are satisfied and is deeply tied to both external and internal balance. By analyzing the character of Holden Caulfield in J.D. Salinger’sThe Catcher in the Rye, the article illustrates the challenges of achievingGeborgenheitand suggests practical implications for applying Busemann’s theory to create supportive environments in educational settings.
This commentary outlines a novel agenda for future mindfulness research, building on various authors’ insights, particularly Indius (Indius, S. (2024). Meditation and Self-transcendence: A Human need?Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science,58(3), 878–883), who integrates Maslow’s hierarchy of needs into the discussion of mindfulness. Indius argues for a revision of humanistic psychology to reflect contemporary needs, emphasizing the dynamic nature of meditation as a transformative process that leads to self-actualization and self-transcendence. This exploration highlights the metaphor of a volcanic eruption to illustrate how meditation can lead to the destruction and subsequent rebirth of psychological needs, fostering a deeper connection to oneself and the environment. Additionally, it examines the interplay of social, material, and cultural contexts in shaping mindfulness practices, suggesting a need for personalization and ecological interconnectedness. The commentary aligns with multiple perspectives presented in the Special Issue, underscoring the necessity of adapting traditional frameworks like Maslow’s to meet evolving cultural and psychological landscapes. Future research pathways include preserving mindfulness breakthroughs, exploring religious worldviews, and integrating social environments into mindfulness studies, ultimately advocating for a holistic understanding of mindfulness as both a process and outcome in the context of human experience.
The willingness to apologize and forgive is robustly associated with relational and personal wellbeing, and thus, it may be worthwhile for children to be taught about the importance of apologies and forgiveness through apology prompting from their parents. However, there is limited research on parental apology prompting, as well as on parental attitudes on the developmental importance of child apologies. Guided by Family System Theory, we investigated whether the proclivity to apologize to and forgive a romantic partner is associated with positive parental attitudes on apologies and parental apology prompting. We also examined the role of childhood experiences with apologies, and moderators of these associations. We recruited a sample of parents of 3–10-year-olds. Parents’ proclivity to apologize to their romantic partner and their childhood experiences with apologies were positively associated with positive parental attitudes on apologies and parental apology prompting. The association between the proclivity to apologize to the romantic partner and parental apology prompting was mediated by positive parental attitudes on the developmental importance of child apologies. The proclivity to retaliate against the romantic partner was negatively associated with positive parental attitudes on apologies and parental apology prompting. Political conservatism and romantic relationship satisfaction moderated the association between the proclivity to apologize to the romantic partner and parental apology prompting. Further, we share measures of childhood experiences with apologies and parental attitudes on apologies that may be useful for future research. Results suggest that it may be advantageous for parent couples to prompt apologies from their children.
Social media has transformed political communication by making it easy to post and free to disseminate information. Interest groups can use social media platforms to direct messages to policymakers and to educate the public about their issues. By providing a platform that can be used by groups regardless of their size or resources, social media expands opportunities for lobbying activities and provides policymakers and the public with information on the interests of a wider and more representative range of groups. To what degree do interest group organizations take advantage of this and what does that advocacy look like? We investigate these questions using an original dataset of nearly 13 million Twitter and Facebook posts from interest groups active in national policymaking in the US. We find that in many ways patterns of lobbying on social media are consistent with how interest groups act in other settings, but that groups seems to view social media as primarily a medium for public education on their issues.
Although the COVID-19 pandemic could have caused both monetary and non-monetary distributional changes, existing studies have only investigated its immediate monetary impacts. This study examines the pandemic’s medium-term impacts on income and well-being inequality using individual longitudinal data from the Japan Household Panel Survey. Gini coefficients and income mobility before and after the pandemic are calculated to analyze income inequality. Various well-being measures such as mental health and life satisfaction are used to analyze well-being inequality. The findings reveal no increase in income inequality. Progressive income growth ensured stable inequality throughout the pandemic. Conversely, on average, well-being worsened, and well-being inequality increased. Furthermore, we find an association between income and well-being inequality. The random-effects and fixed-effects models indicate that the well-being of the high-income group tended to improve, whereas that of the low-income group tended to deteriorate after the outbreak of the pandemic. Additionally, the causal mediation analysis shows that the adoption of remote work served as a factor for the increase in the well-being of people in the high-income group. Remote work became disproportionately prevalent during the pandemic, especially among people in the higher income group. This group experienced various benefits of remote work, which contributed to an improvement in their well-being and an increase in well-being inequality.
Based on the Reserve Capacity Model, this study examined the effect of SES(socioeconomic status) on health status on the health status of menopausal mothers of multicultural families, focusing on mediating effects of self-esteem, assimilation, integration, separation, marginalization, and daily life stress. This is a cross-sectional survey study with secondary analysis of national data on 683 perimenopausal mothers in multicultural families from the 9th Multicultural Adolescents Panel Study surveyed by the Korea Youth Policy Institute in 2019. The subjects were women aged 45–55 years and foreign nationals by origin. For path analysis using observed variables, the Mplus 8.4 program was used. Self-esteem and integration were positively related to health status and negatively related to marginalization and daily life stress. Health status was higher when self-esteem and integration were high, and work-life stress and marginalization were low. To improve the perceived health status of menopausal women in multicultural families, rather than simply focusing on SES through support for employment status and income, it is necessary to improve self-esteem by resolving difficulties caused by SES and cultural adaptation to relieve stress in daily life and to provide multidimensional coping resources that can improve health by lowering risk.
Use of highly visual social media has been shown to be detrimental to body image when containing idealized and unrealistic images, such as “fitspiration” content portraying thin and toned bodies. More recently, social media content that is labelled “body positive” portrays more diverse body shapes and preaches body acceptance and has been shown to improve women’s body image. To date, little is known about the comparative effects of this content on body image when delivered in written versus image form, or how body positive content may influence body image in men. The present study examined the relative effects of body positive and fitspiration quotes and images on body image among women and men, with images selected to target the respective beauty ideals ascribed to women (e.g., thin, toned, small bodies) and men (e.g., hypermuscular bodies). A total of 509 women and 489 men, aged 18–25, were recruited for an online study where they viewed one of five sets of images that targeted the respective beauty ideals for their gender: (1) fitspiration images, (2) fitspiration quotes, (3) body positive images, (4) body positive quotes, or (5) travel images; and completed pre- and post-exposure measures of state appearance satisfaction, body appreciation, appearance comparison, and appearance aspirations. Findings revealed more negative effects of fitspiration images on appearance satisfaction and body appreciation compared to all other conditions, which was true for both women and men. Further, appearance comparison did not emerge as a mediator of these effects, but partial support emerged for the role of appearance aspirations. Discussion centers on the potentially stronger effects of body positive images compared to written content and potential reasons why this was the case for both women and men. The need for more research on the promotion of positive body image in men is considered.
What does the brain mean in a legal domain, and how does integrating neuroscience and law go beyond the practical difficulties highlighted by social scientists and legal theorists? The debate about the confluence of neuroscience and law is both promising and uncertain. Legal theorists took it as a conceptual error, and neuroscience advocates find it a promising emerging field. The social psychological approach towards law is for critical integration of both. Scholars took an alternative route, considering it a fascinating element of scientific discourse. The present article aims to show that the coming of “brain language” in the everyday legal discourse will not become a reality, as truth is inferred through everyday experiences and the interpretations of scientific knowledge. Scientific knowledge through mapping active brain areas by the available brain visualizing techniques shows the correlation between the brain and behavior, not the causation. So, its use in the legal domain seems less institutionalized, showing the determinism of the brain as less authentic in itself when compared with the intuitive path embedded in culture and history. Implication for sociolegal psychology working for dignity and social justice is discussed.
Raymond Aron and Albert Camus have been linked together by Tony Judt as exemplifying “the burden of responsibility,” and have otherwise been classed together as dissenting anti-Communists within French intellectual circles during the Cold War. For all of the significant differences in their personal lives, intellectual orientations, and literary styles, they did indeed seek to uphold a complex ethic of responsibility and integrity in their political and intellectual careers. This ethic was both a reflection and a cause of the sense of solitude that each man endured, or sustained, for much of his life. This essay traces the theme of solitude in their lives and works, from their early political engagements and philosophical ventures in the interwar period, the Occupation, and post-war debates over Communism and decolonization. It also shows how solitude was interwoven in their thinking with ideals of honor, moderation, integrity, and stubborn independence. In showing how Aron and Camus responded to their personal predicaments, the essay suggests that they have much to tell us about how and why we may bear the burden of solitude in political engagement.
ObjectivesLimited evidence is available about the content validity of the EQ-5D-5L in rare skin fragility disorders. Previous research has demonstrated that the skin irritation and self-confidence additional dimensions (bolt-ons) improve the content validity of the EQ-5D-5L in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Our aim was to investigate the content validity of the EQ-5D-5L and the two bolt-ons in Darier’s disease and Hailey-Hailey disease.MethodsIn 2023, we conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 15 adult patients at a university dermatology clinic. Patients completed the EQ-5D-5L with two bolt-ons using a think-aloud technique. We used probing questions to explore the relevance, comprehensiveness and comprehensibility. Thematic analysis was applied to analyze the transcripts from the interviews.ResultsMost patients found both the EQ-5D-5L and the two bolt-ons comprehensible and relevant to their disease. All patients preferred the EQ-5D-5L with the two bolt-ons over the EQ-5D-5L alone. Twelve potential missing concepts were identified after the EQ-5D-5L + bolt-ons, but only financial impact and sex life were identified by more than one patient. Only one patient reported a conceptual overlap between the skin irritation bolt-on and the pain/discomfort dimension.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that there is no actionable evidence indicating gaps in the content validity of the EQ-5D-5L with two bolt-ons in Darier’s and Hailey-Hailey disease. Future studies are encouraged to conduct quantitative psychometric testing of the bolt-ons in this and other chronic dermatological patient populations.
Ambivalent homoprejudice theory posits that homoprejudice manifests as hostile and benevolent beliefs that negatively impact LGBTQIA + -identifying individuals. Extensive research has been conducted on the adverse impact of homoprejudice on gay men, both in general and in workplace contexts. However, there has been minimal research on how ambivalent homoprejudice affects lesbian women in the workplace. A significant challenge in this line of research is the absence of a validated scale to measure ambivalent homoprejudice attitudes towards lesbian women. Therefore, in this series of two studies, we developed and provided psychometric support for the Ambivalent Homoprejudice Toward Lesbian Women at Work Scale (AHW-L). Study 1 (N= 266) established the dimensionality of the scale and provided initial evidence of both reliability and validity. Study 2 was conducted to confirm the structure found in Study 1 in a new sample (N= 204) and provided further evidence of reliability and validity. The final validated scale can be used by organizations to identify prejudice in their organization and support the development of targeted interventions. The aim of this scale is to promote and facilitate rigorous research on the workplace experiences of lesbian women.
Little research has examined the role of social class in the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental well-being. This 4-year longitudinal study in South Korea (N= 86,872; 875,967 responses) assessed well-being before (January 2019 to January 2020) and during (January 2020 to January 2023) the COVID-19 pandemic to determine whetherchangein well-being during this period differed by social class. We expanded the investigation to consider transitions in social class, social distancing measures, and the mechanisms underlying well-being changes according to social class during the pandemic. In particular, we assessed the moderating effects of social class on within-person changes in well-being using conducting multilevel modeling-based analyses in four approaches. First, we found that, while higher-class individuals maintained an average well-being that was higher than that of lower-class individuals, they also experienced a steeper decline in well-being over the course of the pandemic. Relative to their pre-COVID-19 levels, they experienced a significant decrease in well-being in the first, second, and third years of COVID-19, showing no sign of recovery until the pandemic neared its end. Second, this pattern persisted without regard for critical social class transitions following the pandemic: individuals remaining in the higher class during both the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods experienced significant declines in well-being relative to baseline. Third, higher-class individuals faced larger difficulties in maintaining their well-being, particularly with respect to social distancing measures, while the well-being of lower-class individuals was less affected. Fourth, perceived changes in daily life mediated observed class difference in well-being declines, showing that higher-class individuals experienced greater changes in their daily lives due to COVID-19 than lower-class individuals did, resulting in greater declines in well-being. Taken together, these findings indicate that COVID-19 transformed components of life that are essential for the psychological health of the well-off, providing novel insights into the significant power of social class in the experiences of changes in well-being, going beyond the absolute gap that has been well-established by cross-sectional studies. This indicates the need for class-targeted interventions and policies to support well-being across all socioeconomic strata in future crises.
This study investigates the experiences of young individuals in precarious work using panel data collected from two waves of observations in Taiwan. Through a latent profile analysis of participants in the Taiwan Youth Study, it was found that a significant majority consistently fell into the category of lower-paid workers upon entering the workforce. Furthermore, approximately 10% of the sample were identified as the group of precarious work by the age of 30. To further explore the determinants of three distinct groups (i.e., precarious work, lower-paid work, and high achievers), several hypotheses are proposed. The results support the arguments of credential inflation, firm size, and possession of authority in managerial hierarchies. It is also observed that individuals lacking formal credentials tend to have less job security in the public sector compared to the private sector. These findings align with the perspective of political economy, suggesting that young workers in Taiwan, as seen in other contexts, encounter significant challenges and difficulties in the labor market during their transition to adulthood, despite being part of an economy characterized by rapid economic growth and a lower unemployment rate.
Under Community Sponsorship (CS) responsibility for supporting resettlement is outsourced to private actors. This generally includes responsibility for sourcing housing. Using a lens informed by hospitality and humanitarian reason, this article examines the ‘hospitable relations’ put in play in sponsorship arrangements in the Irish context. It draws on findings from a small-scale consultative study involving members of volunteer sponsor groups, sponsored persons, and stakeholders in professional roles connected to the programme. The findings provide insight into how ‘hospitality’ under CS necessarily involves the constitution of unequal power dynamics which intersect with wider societal dynamics and inequalities. It is argued that outsourcing responsibility for housing to volunteer sponsors potentially reinforces dependency on groups while placing sponsored people in unequal and exploitative relationships with private landlords and that responsibility for sourcing housing under CS should rest with the state.
Many Chinese small business owners often say their success "comes from bitterness," yet few studies explore the nature of such bitterness and its moral and symbolic dimensions. Focusing on the bitterness narratives of Yiwu merchants, through the analysis of oral history materials of 123 interviewees, the research reveals (1) "Trading chicken feathers for sugar" as a "bitterness" event stemmed from the collective economic crisis during the ten years of the Cultural Revolution in Mao's era. (2) The core of "bitterness" revolves around the merchants’ "disembedment" and "(re)embedment" with the social structural relationship. However, (3) Yiwu merchants perceived their fluctuating relationships with structures (village collectives, family relatives) as "bitterness." These judgments of bitterness and happiness were formed under the governance of moral values and deeply embedded cultural ideals. In their view, the key to business success is consistently aligning with mainstream moral culture. On the one hand, they value traditional Chinese concepts such as "the association of hardship with success" and "loyalty and attachment to institutional authority." On the other hand, they also prioritize neoliberal values, emphasizing individual competitive abilities and the results they achieve, particularly in the global marketplace. (4) Yiwu merchants' rags-to-riches inspirational stories are accompanied by the symbolic sublimation of “chicken feathers for sugar” from secular to sacred. This sublimation is the result of the multi-agent participation. Focusing on the moral-symbol cultural factors of these small business owners’ structural and economic behavior underlying their bitterness narratives, this study echoes the Strong Cultural Program that calls for cultural relative autonomy.
Nearly half of all marriages in Pakistan are consanguineous, with 29 and 21% of women marrying first cousins on their father’s and mother’s sides, respectively. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the change over time in consanguineous unions in Pakistan. Examining the patterns of the marriage market is particularly important given the substantial improvement in women’s education as women’s education is associated with the decline in consanguineous unions across the world. Our analysis, based on four waves of nationally representative Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) (1990-91, 2006-07, 2012-13, and 2017-18) of currently married women ages 15–49 shows that the prevalence of consanguineous unions has remained stable over time. In fact, a slight increase in cousin marriages is observed in 2006-07. Further, women’s education is negatively associated with cousin marriages. Historically, men in the country have had higher levels of education than women, leading to common occurrences of hypergamous unions (where the husband is more educated than the wife). However, with the advancement of women’s education over time, there has been an observed increase in educational hypogamy, where the wife is more educated than her husband. However, the rise in educational hypogamy has not changed the marriage market norms related to cousin marriages. Moreover, use of modern contraceptive methods is not associated with consanguineous unions. We found an inverse relationship between the children ever born (so far) and cousin marriages. Women in consanguineous marriages tend to have fewer children than women in non-consanguineous marriages. Contrary to common expectations, women in both hypogamous and hypergamous relationships tend to have more children than women whose spouses have the same level of education as them. Overall, the results show that consanguinity patterns are stable, and there is no evidence that the societal changes such as improvement in women’s education and urbanization over time have led to a substantial decline in cousin marriages in Pakistan.
Despite the global proliferation of democracy over recent decades, many democratic governments are experiencing unprecedented levels of public dissatisfaction. This study examines how various beacons of grievance—economic dissatisfaction, safety concerns, perceptions of corruption, and attitudes toward immigration—influence individuals’ satisfaction with democratic governance in Western Europe. Utilizing nationally representative data from the 2012 European Social Survey and indicators from the Global Terrorism Database, we employ a three-level hierarchical linear model to simultaneously analyze individual, regional, and country-level variables. Our exploratory, non-directional hypothesis posits that there is a statistically significant relationship between these multilevel factors and individuals’ satisfaction with democratic governance in the European Union. The findings reveal that subjective perceptions play a more significant role than objective indicators in shaping satisfaction with democratic governance. Specifically, individuals with positive opinions on immigration and higher trust in their national parliament exhibit increased satisfaction with democratic governance. At the regional level, higher migration rates correlate positively with democratic governance satisfaction, suggesting a complex interplay between objective conditions and personal attitudes. Conversely, while economic concerns at the individual level affect satisfaction, objective economic indicators at the country level, such as the GINI coefficient, yield unexpected results, indicating higher satisfaction in more unequal societies. By integrating these diverse grievances within a unified multilevel model, this research advances the theoretical understanding of democratic resilience and highlights the importance of considering multilevel factors in assessing public opinion. The study underscores the need for policymakers to address both subjective perceptions and objective conditions to enhance satisfaction with democratic governance. It also calls for further research into cross-level interactions and additional regional variables to deepen the understanding of the dynamics influencing public contentment with democratic governance.

It outlines ten technical aspects of a quantitative research manuscript and provides a checklist for writing and reviewing a journal article. The final section shares recommendations for supporting the writing process. This article is meant to be used by authors, reviewers, and graduate students for creating scholarly writing that gets published in an academic journal.
The term “preferred future” refers to the outcomes a client hopes to achieve through psychotherapy. Collaborative goal setting is a crucial component of many psychotherapy approaches. This article describes the six ways to focus on a preferred future in solution-focused brief therapy: (1) common project, (2) Vision of a preferred future, (3) goal(s), (4) skill(s), (5) values, and (6) small signs of progress. All variants are briefly expounded upon with accompanied case examples. The second part of the article focuses on the transitions from problem descriptions to various forms of work related to a preferred future, and on the transitions among different methods of preferred future conversations. The primary purpose of this article is to broaden therapists’ strategies when working with preferred futures, enhancing their adaptability in managing these types of conversations with their clients.
We look at how economically divergent siblings in the United States make sense of their economic gaps, highlighting family relationships as an arena in which economic inequalities are experienced and negotiated. Drawing on over sixty in-depth interviews with a racially diverse sample of predominantly middle-class persons who report themselves to be in better economic circumstances than their sibling(s), we examine “sibling difference stories,” or siblings’ explanatory accounts of their economic divergence. We analyze the integration of cultural discourses of inequality into these stories. Siblings deploy a meritocracy discourse of individual responsibility in conjunction with other cultural frames to make sense of economic gaps. These include “Born that Way,” emphasizing inherent differences of ability, and “Birth Order,” about how siblings of different ages experience family life differently due to their age-based location in family structure and history. The “Institutional Failures” frame, prevalent among racial minority siblings, points to the failure of social institutions and policies to provide needed supports to the sibling lagging in achievement. Black, Latino/a, and biracial informants further situate institutional failures within systemic racism. Our study’s relational approach draws attention to the role of intimacy and emotion in how people make sense of inequality.
Black women in the United States experience sexual harassment and violence at rates much higher than do White women, suffering greater psychological and physical harm. We examined how White Racial Identity, race of the female victim, and characteristics of the perpetrator combine to influence White Americans’ willingness to respond in a supportive way toward the sexual harassment complainant (i.e., allyship). White US participants (N= 419) completed a racial identity measure and read about a White male supervisor’s alleged workplace sexual harassment (with violence) of a Black or White female subordinate. The supervisor was portrayed with characteristics to elicit perceptions of high or low supervisor benevolence. As hypothesized and consistent with the aversive racism framework, for the Black complainant only, in the high (but not low) supervisor benevolence condition, stronger White racial identity predicted markedly lower intervention intentions and less supervisor-directed punishment. The effects were mediated by lower perceived complainant suffering. These findings offer insights into the complex dynamics influencing allyship, making White Americans more aware of the factors that may subtly shape their willingness to intervene and offer support for Black women who are victims of interracial sexual harassment, as well informing the development of interventions to produce more equitable treatment of Black women in the workplace.
Cultural sociologists have extensively studied the felicity conditions that make intellectual performances successful and enable intellectuals to drive momentous social transformations through their ideas. However, the dynamics of failed performances remain largely unexplored. In particular, little is known about what happens when intellectuals fail to win the approval of their traditional audiences and instead gain support from those who previously ignored or even despised them. This article examines one such case: Giorgio Agamben’s interventions during the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic. Drawing on his theories of the state of exception and biopolitics, Agamben sharply criticized the Italian government’s response to the pandemic, which included lockdowns, mask mandates, and vaccination requirements. He portrayed science and medicine as threats to meaningful social life and argued that these measures represented an unprecedented attack on civil liberties. After situating Agamben’s pandemic interventions in the context of his intellectual trajectory, the article analyzes the backlash he faced from traditionally sympathetic audiences and the unexpected support he garnered from right-wing nationalists. The article argues that this shift in audience was not prompted by a change in Agamben’s political or theoretical views, but rather originates in long-term transformations that have affected both the left and the right since the publication of his most celebrated writings.
The starting point of the article is the intense controversy in academia and politics about the definition of antisemitism. A critical review of the various proposed definitions as well as of common typologies of the forms of antisemitism reveals relatively similar problems in determining the subject matter. These problems are particularly evident in the classification of antisemitism directed against Israel. Based on these findings, it is proposed that the definition of antisemitism should be based less on individual stereotypes and more on the underlying basic patterns of anti-Jewish semantics that are common to the different variants of antisemitic world views. These basic patterns can allow for an improved analysis and evaluation of potentially antisemitic statements; the patterns can also be productive when dealing with questions such as the difference between racism and antisemitism, or the ideological specifics of the Shoah.
In this paper, I drew upon the theoretical perspectives on gestures to explore how a teacher used gestures for instructional activities in an early childhood Chinese heritage language classroom. The qualitative data included observations, video recordings of class conversations, and artifacts provided by the participants. All the data were collected from the early childhood classroom at a Chinese heritage language school in a city in the southwestern United States city. The findings show how the teacher used gestures to “write” each Chinese character to prepare the children for their writing practices. The findings also show that the teacher strategically displayed knowledge and engaged the children in meaning-making and reviewing previous lessons through different types of gestures. The conclusions include a review of the teacher’s use of gestures for instructional purposes, such as facilitating meaning-making and preparing the young heritage language learners for their writing practice. The conclusions also included the significance of the research by highlighting the contribution to early childhood heritage language education. Specifically, the study helps contribute to the literature on the use of gestures for supporting children’s language learning and provides recommendations for heritage language teachers to consider using different gestures as pedagogical methods.
Sociodemographic patterns and determinants of concern for air pollution are critical to understand given the health benefits of clean air. Yet little evidence exists on group differences in health-specific concern over time and behaviors related to the health consequences of polluted air. We use data from Houston, Texas, to describe how individual sociodemographic characteristics and the local environmental context correlate with health concern for air pollution over two decades, and we estimate associations between health conditions and mitigation behaviors. Findings come from regression analyses of 11 population-representative, cross-sectional surveys conducted between 2000 and 2022 (N= 14,986). Results reveal a secular decline in health concern over the two-decade period, greater concern in communities with high PM2.5 levels, and patterned differences by race, gender, and political party. Differences in health concern by race and political party persisted in mid-2000s and peaked in the late 2010s, while gender differences were evident in the early 2000s and have since narrowed. From the most recent survey, we document positive associations between respiratory health conditions and mitigation behaviors, such as air purifier use. Together, this article offers novel insights into dynamic patterns and correlates of health concerns for air pollution, which can point policymakers and public health officials toward effective messaging strategies to combat the effects of pollutants for population health.
Systematic cross-national analyses of political debates on the admission of refugees and asylum seekers require a theoretically coherent and empirically comprehensive typology of frames and arguments used. The paper proposes such a typology of frames and arguments used by governments, opposition parties and social movements in public debates on the admission of refugees. We argue that the collective identity and characteristics of the receiving country on the one hand and refugees’ characteristics on the other constitute the key dimensions to which frames in political discourse about the admission of refugees refer. We distinguish between six different frames – economic, cultural, moral, legal, security-related and international – of how the “we” and the “others” can be interpreted. Furthermore, we specify typical arguments associated with the respective frames for or against the admission of refugees. Given that the typology was developed based on a discourse analysis of a very diverse set of countries, including some of the so-called “Global South”, we claim that it can be used to analyze political debates on the admission of refugees in other countries as well and can thus contribute to an accumulation of knowledge.
Sociologists have long debated the extent to which their discipline is a science. Donald Black harbored no doubts on this issue. For Black, sociology was the science of social life, distinct from other human sciences, such as biology and psychology. He found inspiration and exemplars for sociology in science, especially at its highest levels, including the importance many renowned scientists have placed on the role of beauty in their work. At various times, scientists have spoken of beautiful hypotheses, beautiful experiments, beautiful methods, beautiful mathematics, and, especially, beautiful theories. Black echoed that sentiment, arguing that the most important theories are beautiful because reality itself is beautiful. This paper documents the central role of aesthetics in Black’s sociology. It traces the role of factors such as simplicity, symmetry, and elegance in five aspects of Black’s work: his use of language and numbers, his concepts, explanatory paradigm, and substantive theories. The beauty of Black’s corpus provides both an example and a challenge to future generations of sociologists.
ObjectiveTo evaluate whether Covid-19 related workflow changes to a clinically-integrated breastfeeding peer counseling (ci-BPC) program were associated with poorer breastfeeding outcomes for Medicaid-enrolled patients.MethodsThis retrospective chart review included patients who received ci-BPC care during January 2017-March 2020 (“Pre-Pandemic,”N= 318); March 2020-September 2020 (“During-Peak,”N= 53); and September 2020-May 2021 (“Post-Peak,”N= 97). ANOVA evaluated differences in encounter type frequencies for each time point, as well as differences in breastfeeding initiation, exclusivity during inpatient admission, and continuation of breastfeeding at least 6 weeks post-delivery.ResultsIn-person prenatal counseling significantly decreased from Pre-Pandemic to During-Peak (43.9–8.2%,p< 0.05). Breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum significantly increased from the Pre-Pandemic cohort to the During-Peak cohort (67–85%,p< 0.05), and returned to baseline for the Post-Peak cohort (74%).Conclusions for PracticeCovid-19 related workflow changes for the peer counselor did not decrease breastfeeding outcomes as anticipated.
According to the QBIT theory, consciousness depends on the emergence of macroscopic coherence in a specific intracellular substrate which registers and processes sensory information. This occurs in a particular neuronal compartment called the axon initial segment which has unique properties not found in other neuronal segments. These unique properties allow the integration of synaptic inputs, amplification of sensory signals, and spontaneous emergence of coherence which is necessary for conscious perception.
This paper is part of a broader research initiative examining algebraic thinking. It presents a case study involving a 4 year-old female student, examining her functional perspective through individual work. Our interest lies in early childhood functional thinking. Specifically, our research objective is to describe how the child completed two tasks involving linear functions and their respective inverse functions. We posed questions related to specific near numbers, specific far numbers, and the generalizations themselves. We gathered data from her individual written work on the two tasks and from an individual interview. We analyzed the strategies she employed to generalize, the representations and generalizations she made, and how she established relationships between variables. We observed that she used pictorial and verbal representations to complete the proposed tasks and successfully achieved generalization. As a strategy, she counted drawings; however, when verbalizing her approach, she created groups of similar elements and innately distributed them into equal groups when working with the inverse function.
Adopting digital extension technologies by smallholder farmers in developing countries, particularly in Africa, is challenging due to various barriers, such as lack of infrastructure, farmers’ low e-literary, and limited access to technology. Our study addresses farmers’ attitudes toward the adoption of new technological approaches to bypass these barriers. We investigated how farmers perceive the paid extension approach and the usefulness of the services proposed. We employed an experimental design conducted in Jigawa and Kano states in Nigeria with a total sample size of 1560 rice farmers selected through a multistage stratified sampling approach. Three distinct paid extension services were randomly assigned to farmers grouped separately as a treatment and a control group. We first subjected the data to reliability, validity, and consistency tests using Cronbach’s Alpha method to test the reliability and then applied the Partial-least Square Structural Equation Modeling method to analyze the data. Depending on the service, there are notable differences in the impact of “perceived usefulness” and “perceived ease of use” on “attitude,” “adoption,” and “actual use” on farmers’ decisions. However, we found that a solid and favorable perception exists of farmers using paid digital extension services. Furthermore, our evidence suggests that price options and payment methods positively influence farmers’ decisions to accept the assigned extension service. Our study contributes foremost to the empirical literature on farmers’ behavior in adopting paid extension services and how much farmers might pay for the proposed service.
The child tax credit expansion of 2021 heralded a substantial, albeit temporary, expansion of the social safety net. Despite the breadth of evidence regarding the credit’s effects on population health, there has been little attention to how families experienced and understood it. This study uses semi-structured interviews conducted between March and June 2023 with 22 caregivers living in Maryland that received the credit to fill gaps about how caregivers experienced the expansion and how their understanding of the expansion shaped these experiences. Caregivers, regardless of income, reported that the expanded child tax credit payments provided financial stability in otherwise uncertain times. However, many were confused by the credit’s structure and concerned about its financial implications for their 2022 tax returns, which contributed to financial anxiety and reinforced feelings of mistrust towards the government, particularly among lower- and middle-income caregivers. Although the expanded child tax credit was broadly beneficial, policymakers enacting similar policies in the future should consider distributing funds outside of the federal tax system, which may be confusing for recipients and may contributed to unintended consequences such as financial anxiety.
The author discusses the psychotherapy of a 41-year-old Caucasian man who complained of a somatic symptom characterized as an “energy” that formulated the words, “I’m gay.” A practitioner of yogic philosophy, the patient came to believe that someone—perhaps a priest—had sexually abused him at age 8 or 9. The author assesses the patient’s attachment relationships to his parents and to his Higher Power and then discusses their similarities and differences. The author also discusses the attachment-informed interventions that have propelled the treatment forward, ending the article by posing spiritual and emotional questions that linger in the patient’s ongoing treatment.
Travel serves as a tool for inner transformation, and educational travel is one form of transformational travel. However, despite their recognition as a niche market, educational travelers, such as international students, continue to be understudied, especially from a gender perspective. As gendered differences are observed in tourism research and gender stereotypes originate from culture and family traditions, this study seeks to answer the following research question: How are gender stereotypes experienced within the context of international students’ mobility experience? This research examines the transmission and dynamics of gender stereotypes and its implication on international students’ mobility experience. It explores students’ interaction and level of involvement with gender stereotypes within different social and relational contexts, and the change processes as a result of these dynamics. Thirty-three in-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with international students from several nationalities who have finished one of the three types of Master’s degree in Tourism, at the University of Girona, Spain. This paper indicates that (a) women and men are still associated under different gender stereotypes, (b) values originating from gender stereotypes evolve according to individuals’ socio-cultural interactions, and (c) these dynamics of gender stereotypes can be experienced under the role of the spectator, spect-actor, and actor.
While the COVID-19 pandemic brought economic uncertainty to many, the literature contains limited information about household alternative financial services used during this time. This study examines how financial circumstances were associated with household rent-to-own product use during the COVID-induced economic downturn, and whether income instability was related to use across income groups. Findings suggest that income drops were strongly associated with rent-to-own use, moreover health insurance, credit record, homeownership, and banking status were also predictors. This study expands the knowledge base regarding the fringe economy participation and household financial well-being and offers steps for future research and policy considerations.
It has been suggested previously that rising economic inequality would push parents to become overly involved in their children’s academic lives. In the present investigation we examined whether parents’ perceptions of economic inequality, in terms of perceived income inequality and perceived job insecurity, is predictive of their school involvement, thereby distinguishing between controlling and autonomy-supportive school involvement. Further, we also tested whether these associations are particularly pronounced among parents facing financial scarcity. To test these hypotheses, we gathered data among 908 parents (58.70% mothers), who filled out questionnaires assessing their perceptions of income inequality and job insecurity, their financial scarcity, as well as their controlling and autonomy-supportive school involvement. Analyses indicated that higher levels of perceived income inequality related to more autonomy-supportive school involvement, whereas higher levels of perceived job insecurity related to more controlling school involvement. Parents’ financial scarcity did not moderate any of the associations, but higher levels of financial scarcity consistently predicted more controlling school involvement. To conclude, these results suggest that both parents’ macro-economic perceptions as well as their personal financial situation shape their child-rearing practices in ways that may potentially perpetuate socio-economic disparities.
Parental employment has long been recognized as a crucial factor influencing children’s well-being, yet limited research has examined the impact of self-employment—an increasingly prevalent form of work globally—on offspring welfare. This study investigates the effects of maternal self-employment on children’s human capital accumulation using nationally representative longitudinal data from the China Family Panel Studies (2014, 2016, and 2018). Employing fixed-effects models, instrumental variable approaches, and nonlinear panel estimations, we find that maternal self-employment positively influences children’s mathematical performance and improves their health outcomes, as evidenced by reduced doctor visits. The beneficial impact is further moderated by maternal education levels and engagement in children’s education. Our findings contribute to the literature on parental employment and child well-being by offering novel insights into how self-employment shapes family dynamics and child development. This research provides important implications for policies supporting women’s employment and promoting child development in contemporary society.
Sexual consent communication can be ambiguous when people rely on nonverbal, implicit cues. This ambiguity can lead to the reliance of contextual information to assess whether a sexual encounter was consensual, both in the moment and retrospectively. The current study examined how level of alcohol consumption, relationship type, and evaluator gender influenced the extent to which various sexual encounters were seen as consensual. Participants read a series of vignettes in which sexual consent was verbally granted, verbally rejected, or inferred using nonverbal cues. The vignettes also manipulated the amount of alcohol consumed by the target of the sexual advances (i.e., sober, tipsy, or intoxicated) as well as the relationship between the dyads (i.e., dating or strangers). Generally, male participants were more likely to interpret all encounters as more consensual. Encounters in which the target was intoxicated were more likely to be interpreted as nonconsensual, but instances when targets were described as tipsy (i.e., she consumed two or less alcoholic beverages) were seen as more consensual than sober encounters. The relationship between the dyads also influenced these perceptions. This work can inform educational efforts geared toward alcohol and sexual consent.
BackgroundMainstream preference-based quality of life (QoL) measures have been traditionally based on Western principles of health. It is critical to examine whether existing preference-based QoL measures capture what is important to Indigenous people while being comprehensive and culturally acceptable. This study aims to assess the content and face validity of the EuroQol-5 dimensions 5-levels (EQ-5D-5 L), 12-item short form survey (SF-12), assessment of quality of life–6 dimensions (AQoL-6D), and recovering quality of life 10-item (ReQoL-10) within the context of indigenous youth mental health.MethodsEight individual yarns and five yarning circles were conducted with 20 indigenous young people aged 15˗25 years, with a history of at least 1 mental health problem in the Perth and Bunbury regions of Western Australia. The measures were explored in random order using the yarning approach, and then ranked by relevance by participants. Data were analysed using thematic and constant comparative approaches.ResultsThe face and content validity of each preference-based QoL instrument was summarised into four themes: (1) appropriateness, (2) comprehensiveness, (3) comprehensibility, and (4) layout and format. The ReQoL-10 emerged as a more suitable measure due to its mental health focus, clear response options, and well-designed layout and format. While some positive comments were made about the other measures, there were critical issues around their content and face validity. Our data revealed a clear preference for the ReQoL.ConclusionThe ReQoL-10 appears to be a promising measure in the context of indigenous youth mental health, and was explicitly preferred by indigenous youth.
PurposeThe association between cardiovascular health (CVH) with perceived quality of life (PQoL) and variations by sex and Hispanic ethnicity is not well understood.MethodsThis study included 583 participants (42% Hispanic, 56% female, mean age 59 years). Linear regression modeled the covariate-adjusted associations between CVH, using the combined 7 components of Life’s Simple 7 (LS7; ideal and intermediate, compared to poor), and PQoL (total and physical, social, and cognitive health domains). For individual LS7 components, we assessed effect modification by sex and Hispanic ethnicity.ResultsCompared to individuals with poor CVH, those with intermediate (β [95% CI] = 0.22 [0.09, 0.35]) and ideal (β [95% CI] = 0.22 [0.08, 0.36]) CVH had higher overall PQoL. This effect was dominated by the physical PQoL domain. Of LS7 components, ideal body mass index (BMI) (β [95% CI] = 0.17 [0.03, 0.31]) and physical activity (β [95% CI] = 0.26 [0.12, 0.40]) were associated with overall PQoL. Ideal diet (β [95% CI] = 0.32 [0.08, 0.56]) and fasting plasma glucose (β [95% CI] = 0.32 [0.06, 0.58]) were associated with the physical PQoL domain. A higher PQoL score was associated with intermediate BMI in women, and physical PQoL was associated with smoking for women. A BMI*Hispanic interaction resulted in larger associations between intermediate/ideal BMI and physical PQoL in non-Hispanics.ConclusionIdeal or intermediate CVH health factors and health behaviors were associated with higher PQoL. Sex and ethnicity differences suggest that perceived quality of life is associated with BMI for women and non-Hispanics.
Low-wage labor migrants experience major human and working rights abuses in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries despite national labor laws and signatures to various human rights conventions. On paper, India has established an institutional framework of transnational social protection for its officially estimated 5.5 million low-wage workers migrating to the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, e.g., financial emergency support, repatriation services, and walk-in centers. However, migrants in low-wage employment often cannot access substantive social rights in practice. Indian upper/middle-class migrant civil society groups mediate their access to Indian embassies’ services and the destination countries’ state institutions. The realization of social rights via informal, third-party representation stems from a representational disjuncture between low-wage labor migrants and the Indian state, which is rooted in their historical socioeconomic marginalization, limitations of the formal political system, and the constitutive role of informality in shaping and structuring citizen-state interactions in India. Through the lens of Piper and von Lieres’ (2015) concept of mediated citizenship and based on data from semi-structured interviews and participant observation of migrant support networks in the Gulf countries, this article examines why mediation takes place and how volunteers speak and take action for marginalized migrants in low-wage employment and consequences of mediation. It argues that migrant volunteer organizations and individuals are powerful stakeholders in the migration governance in the GCC region, as they possess leverage over who has (better) access to state institutions and the provision of social and human rights. Their status as intermediaries underlines the disaggregation of Indian citizenship along class and caste lines, which can be (mis)-used by mediators to pursue their interests, resulting in ambiguous effects. The article contributes to perspectives on migration governance in the GCC region, transnational social policies, and migrant volunteering.
American research universities experienced fragmentation and decline following the populist uprising of the mid-2020s. This article examines the causes and consequences of the academic reformation, analogizing the weaknesses of research universities in the 2020s to the weaknesses of the Roman Catholic Church of the sixteenth century. The article highlights several ruinous trends dating from the 2010s. These included high costs, the rise of just-in-time learning, and socio-political initiatives that alienated large segments of the public. The article discusses the benefits and costs of the academic reformation and what changes could have been put in place to prevent the decline of American research universities during the period.
Previous research has predominantly concentrated on school-related factors in adolescent bullying victimization, often overlooking the "cycle of victimization" stemming from parental punishment at home. Moreover, the mechanisms linking parental harsh punishment to bullying victimization have not been sufficiently investigated. This study aimed to investigate the association between parental harsh punishment and bullying victimization, as well as the mediating roles of cooperation and trust. Additionally, the present study sought to make cross-cultural comparisons by testing the moderating effects of collectivism versus individualism. A sample of 50,355 adolescents, with a mean age of 13.11 years (50.70% boys), from nine countries was obtained from the Study on Social and Emotional Skills. The moderated mediation mode was conducted using the SPSS macro PROCESS. Parental harsh punishment was positively associated with bullying victimization. Higher levels of parental harsh punishment were linked to decreased cooperation and trust, which in turn contributed to increased bullying victimization. The associations between parental harsh punishment and both cooperation and trust were more pronounced among adolescents living in individualist cultures than among those in collectivist cultures. This study advanced our understanding of the mechanisms linking parental harsh punishment and adolescent bullying victimization, and it has implications for intervention strategies.
This paper focuses on the evolutionary mechanism of social emotions, such as panic, anxiety, and depression, during the COVID-19 pandemic by using big data from the internet, including Twitter and GDELT, and by incorporating factors related to risk communication and risk response in risk governance. The main negative emotions experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic include panic, anxiety, and depression. These negative emotions primarily erupted on a large scale during the initial phase of the first wave of the epidemic, whereas the fluctuations in negative emotions during subsequent resurgences were significantly smaller. This paper explains the evolution of panic and depression through analytical frameworks based on threat perception and coping efficacy, as well as social pressure and social support. The fluctuations in negative emotions around the world exhibit both similarities and diversities, which are closely related to the diversity of pandemic response models and cultural characteristics across different regions. The findings of this study have important implications for emergency management and the guidance of social mentality.
This article invites a dialogue between decolonial perspectives on diasporas and feminist standpoint theories by exploring processes of standpoint formation by women of Moroccan descent who grew up in postcolonial France. The article draws on 18 interviews with women aged in their 20s to their 40s, as well as a long-term engagement with these questions through ‘patchwork ethnography’. While emphasising that these women were neither exposed to identical experiences nor have the same worldviews, the article shows that they have navigated a set of shared experiences that pertain to their social position and that they are thus aware of the manifestations in their everyday lives and of the workings of gendered and racialised social hierarchies that affect them. The article explores participants’ experiences of racism and of its gendered inflections; the formation of ‘shared angles of visions’ (Hill Collins,1997) around specific issues as a result; and finally, participants’ assessments of the different terms used to describe them in public and in everyday discourses. The article seeks to contribute to thinking through empirically the formation of an epistemological standpoint at the crossroads of feminist and decolonial approaches.
Cannabis is a popular leisure activity in many cultures, especially in North America and Europe, where it is commonly used for socializing and entertainment. A recent German study employed the Marijuana Motives Measure to survey young adults, analyzing four motivational factors in the context of casual leisure. The research aimed to understand the reasons behind adults’ daily cannabis use, its link to consumption frequency, and situations. The findings highlight cannabis use for hedonic pleasure, relaxation, and enhancing social experiences. Individuals driven by self-focused motives, seeking relaxation and hedonic pleasure, tend to use it more frequently, while other-focused motives, such as sociable conversation, are associated with less frequent and occasional consumption. The study further revealed that people who consume cannabis for self-focused motives typically do so alone or with someone at home, whereas those who use it for other-focused motives, such as sociable conversation, tend to do so in social settings.
Shame significantly influences identity formation, often undermining one’s sense of self. Since the exacerbation of racial discrimination against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian American youth have struggled with increased incidents of anti-Asian hate and significant psychological impacts. This paper explores the intersection of racial discrimination and identity formation among Asian American youth, focusing on how experiences of shame influence their sense of self. It examines the historical context of Asian American identity struggles, using contemporary literature, particularly Gene Luen Yang’sAmerican Born Chinese. Building on Donald Capps’s theories on shame and self-identity, the paper examines the relationship between shame and the challenges of selfhood. It further considers how embracing shame can empower individuals to reclaim their authentic selves, drawing on Jesus’s experiences with shame in his childhood and on the cross. Ultimately, it explores ways Asian American youth might embrace their experience of shame and vulnerability to promote their self-identity.
This study explores the dynamics of Intimate Partner Violence dynamics and the help-seeking experiences of immigrant women during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Portugal through an intersectional framework. Despite ample literature on intimate partner violence, few studies have explicitly focused on the compounded challenges faced by immigrant women during a global health crisis. Through qualitative research, we conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with immigrants who experienced intimate partner violence during the pandemic. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis. The results reveal that the pandemic exacerbated violence dynamics, with most participants reporting an increase in violence and a diversification in its types. Additionally, the coping mechanisms employed by victims were often ineffective in mitigating this violence. Regarding help-seeking, the study identified five main barriers, highlighting the role of cultural barriers, isolation, lack of knowledge about available resources, economic dependency, and fear of legal repercussions. These barriers compounded the difficulties faced by victims in accessing support. This research reinforces the transversal impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the lives of immigrant women who faced intimate partner violence, emphasizing the need to adopt an intersectional approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this vulnerable population. Actions needed include culturally tailored educational campaigns to raise awareness of violence and available resources, community-building initiatives to reduce isolation, and policy reforms to improve the accessibility and responsiveness of support services for this population.
Does philosophy need to study its own history? Yes, but for nonhistoricist reasons. Regardless of when, where, and why they were written; what texts influenced them; and what influence they subsequently exerted, some works of the past have enduring value that transcends the particulars of their time and place. They are, to use an unfashionable word, “great.” Introduction introduces this thesis by considering Leo Strauss’s arguments against historicism and his conception of a nonhistoricist reading of the history of philosophy. Using Aristotle as an exemplar, Poetry Is More Philosophical Than History and Epistemic Access to Nonhistorical Universals elaborate on what this might mean. A Great Book builds on their results in order to examine the notion of a “great book,” a phrase that only makes sense if nonhistoricist thought is deemed possible.
La Guajira, a department in northern Colombia, faces significant socioeconomic challenges, including high poverty levels and marginalization. This study aims to analyze the socioeconomic marginalization of municipalities in La Guajira, Colombia, by identifying key factors contributing to their vulnerability. Using Principal Component Analysis, the paper examines 21 socioeconomic indicators derived from the 2018 National Population and Housing Census conducted by the National Administrative Department of Statistics to uncover the multidimensional aspects of marginalization. The findings reveal three main dimensions of marginalization related to household socioeconomic disadvantages, infrastructure and basic services deficiencies, and ethnic and physical vulnerabilities. Municipalities are grouped into three clusters based on these dimensions using Cluster Analysis, highlighting stark differences between them, particularly the northern areas with indigenous communities. The results provide a foundation for targeted policies to address the unique socioeconomic issues of municipalities in La Guajira.
PurposeWe investigated the validity of the German and Spanish translations of 35 new high functioning items added to the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Physical Function item bank 2.0. We assessed differential item functioning (DIF) between three general population samples from Argentina, Germany, and the United States.MethodsPROMIS Physical Function data was collected in online panels from 3601 individuals (mean age, 41.6 years old; range, 18–88 years; 53.7% female). Of these, 1001 participants completed the Spanish version, 1000 completed the German version, and 1600 completed the English version. DIF was assessed by a multiverse analysis that systematically varied analytic choices across the entire range of plausible options within the logistic ordinal regression framework.ResultsTranslated items generally met the assumptions of unidimensionality, monotonicity, and local independence. The 272 different analyses suggest consistent DIF between languages in four items. Test characteristic curves suggested that the magnitude and impact of DIF on the test scores were negligible for all items at the test level. After correcting for potential DIF, we observed greater scoring for physical functioning in Argentina compared to the US, Cohen’sd= 0.25, [0.17, 0.33], and Argentina compared to Germany, Cohen’sd= 0.23, [0.15, 0.32].ConclusionsOur findings support the universal applicability of PROMIS Physical Function items across general populations in Argentina, Germany, and the U.S. The sensitivity analyses indicate that the identification of DIF items was robust for different data analytic decisions. Multiverse analysis is a promising approach to address lack of clear cutoffs in DIF identification.
Extensive policy and practice attention aims to support young people as they seek to achieve educational and career goals yet there are widely varying trajectories toward these goals that reflect individual preferences and social inequalities. This study reports findings from qualitative interviews with 16 young adults currently enrolled in a primarily vocational pathway at a community college and who had prior involvement with child welfare, juvenile justice or mental health systems. Using a narrative approach, respondents described their career and educational pathways including their current status, antecedents, and future trajectory. Key factors that have impacted their pathway include their initial vocational interests, messages from within their social networks, and impacts of work and family life on educational goals. Study results have implications for better supporting young people with system involvement to identify and achieve their educational and career goals.
This study analyzes the measurement of income and wealth inequalities in samples with negative values. The Gini coefficient can exceed one when negative values represent a large share of the sample. A perfect concentration with non-negative values attains a Gini coefficient of one; thus, interpreting a Gini coefficient greater than one is difficult. Existing methods of deleting negative values or replacing them with zeros underestimate the inequality level. Alternative methods of normalizing the Gini coefficient to restrict it between zero and one cannot satisfy the basic requirements of an inequality index. Moreover, both methods distort inequality comparisons over time and across countries. This study analytically shows the theoretical drawbacks of extant methods and proposes measuring the standard Gini coefficient using an unadjusted sample, even when the sample contains negative values and the Gini coefficient exceeds one. This study also proposes generalizing the concentration such that it attains the same Gini coefficient value and is more severely concentrated than the perfect concentration with non-negative values. To facilitate the interpretation of a Gini coefficient greater than one, we can compare the generalized and perfect concentrations and infer the amount of transfer from one to the other. Finally, this study shows that the extant methods may cause a sizable distortion in inequality comparison over time for the U.S. net worth.
This study investigated the associations among acculturative family distancing in communication and values, family conflicts (parent-adolescent conflict, interparental conflict), and depressive symptoms and the mediating effects of family conflicts in the associations between acculturative family distancing in communication and values, and depressive symptoms in KA adolescents. Path analysis was used to analyze data from a cross-sectional survey of 339 Korean American adolescents (Mage = 14.99, SD = 1.67; 53% female) residing in New York City and New Jersey. Measurements include the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) Scale, Acculturative Family Distancing Youth Report Scale (AFD-YR), the Family Conflicts Scale (FCS), and the Children’s Perception of Interparental Conflict Scale. All path coefficients for the final model were statistically significant. There were significant mediating effects of parent-adolescent conflict and interparental conflict on the associations between acculturative family distancing in communication and values and depressive symptoms. The study suggests acculturative family distancing may be a contextual risk factor for depressive symptoms among KA youth. Additionally, greater acculturative family distancing may erode the strength and quality of family relationships. One of the objectives of this study was to test the AFD theory which identifies more problematic dimensions of intergenerational acculturation gap that increase risk for family conflict. The findings of the current study not only support but also build on the AFD theory by examining its relationship to both interparental and parent-adolescent conflicts.
This study aimed to observe contraceptive access, including types of contraceptives and level of use, among girls and young adults living in foster care following a state policy insurance change. This cohort study utilized linked, state administrative data to analyze child welfare and Medicaid claims data of 1641 female foster youth in Michigan. Oral tablets with a supply of 30 days before exhaustion was the most frequently prescribed contraceptive (77%), while injections, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) that have longer periods of use before exhaustion were rarely prescribed. Longer-term use products were prescribed with decreased frequency in the Medicaid Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) period than in the Medicaid Fee for Service (FFS) period. Foster youth placed in residential care experienced greater access to contraceptive care than those placed in family-based settings (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.63, 95% CI = (0.56–0.72)) and those living independently (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.55, 95% CI = (0.48–0.64)). Those in the largest urban county had less access (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.81, 95% CI = (0.71–0.92)) to contraceptives than those from other counties in the State. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.
This study examined the treatment efficacy of multiple family narrative therapy (MFNT) on psychological well-being and parent-child relationship among Chinese families of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Hong Kong. ADHD highly affects the academic performance of children and causes stress from its symptoms and medication side effects, while parents struggle to align their children’s needs with school and social expectations. Randomized control trial by site was adopted. A total of 61 families were randomized into the treatment group and the waitlist control group. Assessments were made at pre-intervention and post-intervention, and a 3-month follow-up assessment was made to assess the sustainability of the effects. Participants demonstrated significant reduction in parents’ psychological distress (p=.047), child-perceived parental rejection (p=.015), and paternal overprotection (p=.001). However, no significant results were observed on parental stress, guilt and shame, and parent-perceived parent-child relationships. As conventional support in Hong Kong for families raising children with ADHD primarily focuses on children’s behavioral performance, MFNT establishes crucial groundwork for promoting psychological well-being, addressing intrafamilial needs, and enhancing parent-child relationships through a shift in parental perceptions of ADHD. Limitations and recommendations for future studies are discussed.
Research on men and masculinities is increasingly concerned with contemporary transformations in the way men understand and “do” gender. In particular, burgeoning paradigms like the hybrid masculinities framework have called attention to diverse patterns of practice among men that are seemingly at odds with traditional iterations of hegemonic masculinity. We conceptualize one component of this practice as a concerted process of “strategic masculine disinvestment.” Using new, nationally representative survey data pertaining to men living in the United States, we ask two novel questions about this phenomenon that have not been addressed at the population level. First,whodisinvests from traditional masculinity? While masculine distancing tends to be observed among privileged men in qualitative studies, a comprehensive view of which men engage in this practice within the general population is absent from the literature. Secondly, how are contemporary transformations of gender like strategic masculine disinvestment associated with psychosocial functioning? Findings suggest that strategic masculine disinvestment is more common among young and college educated men, but is not necessarily unique to unilaterally privileged men. In fact, men experiencing financial strain are especially likely to disinvest from masculinity. We also observe that strategic masculine disinvestment is consistently associated with poorer psychosocial functioning, including lower levels of mastery and higher levels of anger, anxiety, depression, and non-specific psychological distress. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for studies of men and masculinities and of contemporary transformations of gender more generally.
PurposeTo demonstrate the process and results of an equity analysis of a reproductive health association.DescriptionA series of quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews were conducted with employees of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts (PPLM), assessing different aspects of equity. Amaka Consulting and Evaluation Services, LLC, an external consulting agency, analyzed the results and provided recommendations for improvements.AssessmentBetween 25% and 33% of the employees identified as Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). Staff expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the organization’s alignment to its mission and commitment to equity. Turnover was higher among BIPOC employees, and employees of color were less likely to say they had confidence in senior management. Themes that arose frequently in surveys included the need for increased communication around equity action steps, greater accountability, and work environment issues. Qualitative interviews indicated acknowledgment of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts but feeling that they were not as legitimate as they could be and vocalized a need for more equitable hiring. Recommendations for improvements included tracking feedback around social movements; conducting equity impact assessments; supporting staff through salary, opportunities for advancement, and better supervision; requiring management to attend equity initiatives, and creating equity resources for staff.ConclusionThis study provides a template for other evaluations of equity. Similar to other organizations in the field, this equity analysis suggests that PPLM had a stronger commitment to certain aspects of DEI than others, and that there was a need for improvement in several areas, particularly hiring and management.
Limited data are available on the characteristics and outcomes both of people who have and who have not had an abortion. Administrative data sources contain information on aggregate abortion counts and some demographic characteristics describing individuals who had an abortion but not on those who did not have an abortion. They are therefore of limited use for analyzing the characteristics, reproductive behaviors, and attitudes associated with abortion risk. Direct questions in population representative surveys yield downwardly biased estimates of abortion and likely differential underreporting of abortion by socio-demographic characteristics. In the present study, we evaluate the effectiveness of an indirect survey method, the list experiment, for improving estimates of abortion risk and differentials in population-representative surveys. We estimate cumulative-lifetime abortion incidence in 2017 and five-year incidence in 2021 using two cross-sectional surveys administered in Delaware and Maryland and evaluate the five-year estimates against external benchmarks from administrative data. We use multivariate regression with the list-experiment data to examine abortion incidence by socio-demographic predictors. We find that list-experiment estimates of five-year abortion incidence are similar to estimates calculated from external data: that cumulative lifetime abortion incidence increases monotonically with age, and that five-year incidence is inverse U-shaped. Black adults are found to be much more likely to have had an abortion both in the past five-years and over the reproductive lifetime, before and after controlling for age, parity, relationship status, education, and household income. We conclude positively about the validity and utility of the list experiment method.
This study explores the influence of family firms’ socioemotional wealth (SEW) purpose and cash flow on their environmental contributions. It uses data from 754 publicly listed and over-the-counter family firms in Taiwan from 2016 to 2022. Following previous research, SEW is distinguished into focused SEW and broad SEW and cash flow patterns, mapped into firm life cycle stages. Empirical results show focused SEW is negatively correlated with the environmental contribution of family firms, while broad SEW is positively correlated. From a cash flow perspective, during the introduction stage, focused SEW family firms tend to lag in environmental contribution. In the mature stage, focused SEW family firms lead in environmental contribution, while broad SEW family firms lag behind. Empirical evidence suggests that the reference point of family firms is not fixed but changes dynamically as the firm progresses through its life cycle. This study highlights the consideration of SEW by family firms, which depends on their specific life cycle stage.
Research on family business has a long history which is evident in various established theories and practices. Yet, family business sustainability is an underdeveloped area of research. The present study identifies and analyzes the constituents that impact strategic management implementation to achieve sustainability of family firms. This is an empirical study based on a sample of Indian family firms, analyzes using “partial least squares structural equation modeling” (PLS-SEM). Results demonstrate that innovation, competitive advantage, leadership and proactiveness significantly impact strategic management implementation and sustainability of family firms. However, engaging the local community has a negative impact on strategic management implementation and sustainability of family firms. The study makes several contributions to family businesses literature by shedding light on the key factors that foster their future development and sustainability across developed and developing nations. This study offers guidance on strategically organizing and implementing effective sustainability strategies within family firms. This enhancement advances the theoretical understanding and supports practical efforts to ensure family-owned enterprises’ long-term viability and success.
Over recent decades, errors and misbehaviors (E&M) within the banking and finance (B&F) sector have garnered attention from both scholars and practitioners. However, existing knowledge in this area remains fragmented. This paper aims to provide a systematization of existing findings and to develop an integrative framework. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify relevant works on this subject (n= 57), with the aim of constructing an integrative framework that delineates potential antecedents and consequences of E&M while also identifying avenues for future research. Research on E&M in the B&F context can be categorized into several strands: individual and/or organizational behaviors, insider trading, oversight by authorities, the influence of national culture, the repercussions for banks’ reputations, and the relevance of digitalization. Our findings underscore the necessity of broadening research methodologies, expanding investigations into management procedures and control mechanisms, delving into the interaction effects among antecedents, and deepening our understanding of the role played by environmental factors.
The focus of this pilot investigation was to determine if the EA Briefing (previously referred to as the EA Brief), could improve self-reported and observed emotional availability (EA) as well as maternal wellbeing. Participants in this study were mothers and their children, including infants, preschoolers, school-aged children, and adolescents. All assessments were administered prior to and at the end of the intervention. These assessments included the observational Emotional Availability (EA) Scales, the Emotional Availability Self-Report (EA-SR), and the Flourishing Scale. During the intervention, mother-child dyads were in their homes and filmed via Zoom. Each mother completed a single, short, individualized parent feedback and coaching session and received information about emotional availability, attachment, and mindfulness. Results examined differences between the groups and indicated that those who received the intervention showed more improvement in observed EA and self-reported EA than those who did not. Additionally, parent-child dyads of all age groups in the study demonstrated improvements. This suggests that the EA Briefing may be relevant for a wider age range of children than have previously participated. The study may also encourage other attachment-based interventions to examine their effectiveness with older children.
Previous work has explored the bi-directional relation between alcohol consumption and gambling behavior within gambling contexts, highlighting the role of salient factors such as mood. The present experiment sought to further explore how mood state and the urge to consume alcohol vary as a function of the experience of winning or losing while gambling. In this experiment, 76 individuals who reported past year gambling and past month alcohol use were randomly assigned to one of four conditions – neutral gambling, winning gambling, losing gambling, or movie watching. Results indicated that mood state did not significantly differ by experimental condition. However, the urge to consume alcohol significantly differed by experimental condition when accounting for weekly alcohol consumption. Individuals who underwent a losing gambling experience reported significantly greater alcohol-related urges than those who watched a movie or had a neutral gambling experience, but not compared to those who had a winning gambling experience. Exploratory analyses showed that those exposed to a losing gambling experience wanted a significantly greater number of drinks than those who had a neutral gambling experience or watched a movie. These results suggest that experiencing losing may contribute to a greater desire to consume alcohol, and that this relation may occur independent of mood states associated with gambling outcomes. Future research should seek to investigate the relations between gambling, alcohol use, and mood in naturalistic gambling settings beyond the laboratory.
PurposeAnal fissures and anorectal fistulas are diseases often associated with significant pain and prolonged discomfort, resulting in a significantly reduced quality of life (QoL). They are not only a surgical problem but also have a profound psychosocial impact and influence on QoL. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of depression in patients with these pathologies and to highlight the need to address the psychosocial aspects of these diseases.MethodsData from the Disease Analyzer database of approximately 3,000 general practitioners in Germany were retrospectively analyzed. The retrospective cohort study included patients aged ≥ 18 years diagnosed with anal fissure (n = 15,467) or anorectal fistula (n = 3,520) between January 2005 and December 2022 and propensity score matched individuals without these disorders (n = 94,935). The primary outcome was a diagnosis of depression within five years of the index date. Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox regression analyses were used to analyze the association between the two anorectal diseases and depression.ResultsAfter 5 years of follow-up, 13.0% of patients with anal fissure and 12.3% of patients with anorectal fistula were diagnosed with depression, compared with 9.7–10.3% in the control group (p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed a significant association between both diseases and depression (anal fissure: HR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.25–1.38; anorectal fistula: HR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.17–1.44).ConclusionThe results suggest that anal fissures or anorectal fistulas are significantly associated with a subsequent depression. This highlights the importance of multidisciplinary management that addresses both physical and psychosocial aspects to improve patient outcomes.
ObjectivesThe specific aims of the project are: (1) Examine the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy experiences and outcomes; (2) Examine the mental health impact of COVID-19 in pregnant women and mothers of children 12 months or younger; (3) Identify risk and protective factors among this population in Puerto Rico.MethodsParticipants were recruited from the Puerto Rico Team for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) Superfund Program, which is composed of pregnant women and mothers from the northern karst region of Puerto Rico. The research had a mixed methods approach with a quantitative survey (n = 184) and qualitative interviews (n = 10); data collection was done in virtual mode.ResultsFindings from the qualitative interviews highlight the experiences regarding access to healthcare services, pregnancy and birth experiences, social support, and mental health during the pandemic among women with young children. These narratives serve to illustrate the particular challenges and opportunities that the participants faced during the year 2021 in regard to maternal health in Puerto Rico.Conclusions for PracticeCOVID-19 restrictions impacted the experiences in receiving healthcare services, particularly regarding the birthing process and the participants’ mental health. Social support, particularly from family, was found to be a protective factor for facing the challenges during pandemic times. We expect that the findings can lead to the development of interventions for community health centers, prenatal clinics, non-governmental organizations, and parents/caretakers in Puerto Rico.
BackgroundThe objective of this study was to assess the content validity of the EQ-5D-5L and four bolt-ons: skin irritation, self-confidence, social relationships and sleep, for people with atopic dermatitis (AD) and chronic urticaria (CU).MethodsAdults with AD or CU in the United Kingdom, with varying levels of severity, participated in either online or in-person semi-structured interviews. During the interviews, participants were first asked about the symptoms and impacts of their condition. They were then asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L and four bolt-ons using ‘think-aloud’ and retrospective probing. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, then analysed using content and thematic analysis.ResultsThirty participants (N= 15 with AD;N= 15 with CU) were interviewed. Participants spontaneously reported itch (AD: 100%; CU: 93%), self-confidence (AD: 100%, CU: 47%), sleep (AD: 53%; CU: 53%), and social relationships (AD: 27%; CU: 60%). The skin irritation bolt-on was the most important or relevant dimension for 60% of AD and 73% of CU participants. For all participants, skin irritation and self-confidence bolt-ons improved the EQ-5D-5L’s comprehensiveness. Social relationships was more frequently ranked as the least relevant among the other bolt-ons.ConclusionsThis study assessed the content validity of four EQ-5D-5L bolt-ons within two patient populations. Skin irritation, self-confidence and sleep bolt-ons showed good evidence of content validity for people with AD and CU, providing support for their application in other skin conditions. The value of a social relationships bolt-on was less clear. Quantitative psychometric research is recommended to further support the use of bolt-ons in CU and AD.
Sexual and gender diverse youth and young adults (SGDY) experience significant mental health disparities compared to non-SGDY and lack access to culturally responsive mental health supports. Limited literature on affirmative interventions for SGDY exists. As part of a larger pilot study, the present qualitative study sought to understand the experiences of SGDY who received the Tuned In! intervention to explore its potential benefit in supporting SGDY mental health. Tuned In! is a virtual affirmative mindfulness-based intervention, co-created with and for SGDY. SGDY (16–29 yrs.) were recruited from Connecticut to participate in the intervention via social media advertisements, and were invited to follow-up virtual focus groups after completing the intervention. Twenty-five SGDY participated in four virtual focus groups, with an additional 12 SGDY providing written feedback. The following overarching research questions guided this study: (1) What are the experiences of SGDY participating in the Tuned In! intervention? (2) What specific improvements are needed to provide enhanced support for SGDY participating in the Tuned In! intervention? Reflexive thematic analysis revealed three overarching themes: (1) mindfulness and self-compassion can support SGDY well-being, (2) spaces that cultivate SGDY community, and (3) the importance of diversity, safety, inclusion, and accessibility. Findings suggest Tuned In! can support SGDY mental health, which points to practical recommendations for future evaluation and implementation of affirmative mindfulness-based interventions for SGDY.
In contrast to the international context of residential care and the preference for family based care, residential care in Portugal is the only option for most young people in the child protection system. Despite this, research in Portugal has yet to focus on Therapeutic Residential Care (TRC) and has rarely considered the narratives of young people. By adopting the conceptual framework proposed by Farmer et al. (2017) and focusing on five critical domains (Setting, Staffing, Treatment Approach, Safety, and Milieu Factor), we aimed to identify a subset of factors that contribute to youth improvement. This convergent parallel mixed methods study involved conducting semi-structured interviews with 14 young people, mostly female (71%), aged 14–18 years (M= 16.3,SD= 1.8), at five TRC facilities in Portugal. Young people and staff also completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and the youth self-report or child behaviour checklist to assess internalising and externalising symptoms. Content analysis revealed mostly positive perceptions and experiences across the domains (Setting, Staffing, Treatment Approach, Safety, Milieu Factor and Profile Characteristics). However, half of the youth reported being vulnerable to peer contagion and females with higher internalising and externalising symptoms reported more negative perceptions and experiences of TRC. These findings highlight that creating an organisational social context that supports participatory approaches to assessing quality may provide invaluable insights into how services can be responsive to young people’s needs. Focusing on establishing high-quality relationships with staff, peers, family, and the community may be key to ensuring the long-term success of TRC.
Increased risk of multimorbidity has been linked to depressive symptoms, and the onset of multimorbidity can further aggravate these symptoms. However, the lagged relationship between these two factors remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the bidirectional longitudinal association between multimorbidity and depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older adults in China over time, specifically focusing on gender and urban-rural differences in this relationship. Data from 8692 participants in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), collected between 2011 and 2020, were analyzed on a biannual basis. The ten-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) was utilized to assess depressive symptoms, complemented by self-reported information on 12 chronic diseases to evaluate multimorbidity. Cross-lagged panel models, adjusted for various covariates, were employed to investigate the bidirectional relationship between multimorbidity and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the analysis examined gender and urban-rural differences across four distinct subgroups: urban men, urban women, rural men, and rural women. A significant bidirectional relationship was identified between multimorbidity and depressive symptoms. Higher levels of multimorbidity were associated with more severe depressive symptoms and vice versa. Path analyses revealed that the influence of multimorbidity on depressive symptoms was stronger than the reverse relationship. Furthermore, subgroup analyses highlighted variability in these associations, with significant bidirectional relationships observed only among rural women across different periods. The findings reveal positive bidirectional associations between multimorbidity and depressive symptoms in middle-aged and older Chinese adults. The results underscore the importance of early monitoring of multimorbidity and depression, especially concerning the mental and physical health of women in rural areas.
As prekindergarten and kindergarten (PreK/K) programs continue to expand into public elementary schools, a key actor in this process of integration and alignment is the school principal. While there is a growing body of scholarship that examines how principals integrate and align these programs with the later grades of elementary school, little is known about how principals identify the support prekindergarten and kindergarten teachers need to be successful in educating and preparing their students for school success; such information can provide insight into principals’ understanding of the work PreK/K teachers are doing daily in their classrooms. This case study examines this issue by investigating how a sample of elementary school principals in Texas made sense of the support PreK/K teachers require to be successful in their positions. Such findings reveal principals’ sensemaking of PreK/K teachers and their programs. These findings also illuminate what principals and their teachers might need from district and state administrators to lead these programs more effectively so that all students can begin their academic careers on a trajectory to thrive in elementary school.
Subsidies that reduce childcare costs for low-income families have been linked with benefits including increases in parental employment and use of higher quality care. However, these benefits accrue mainly to families who access subsidies for sustained periods. The recertification process, whereby families must periodically document that they are still eligible for subsidies, has been identified as administratively burdensome and as a barrier to continuous subsidy enrollment. Drawing on a novel survey (n = 501) and interviews (n = 64) with families in New Mexico, this study used logistic regression and thematic analysis to examine family characteristics associated with successful recertification, facilitators and impediments to successful recertification, reasons for subsidy exit, and implications of recertification processes for family stability. Results showed families with full-time employment, fewer adults in the home, and lower incomes had greater odds of recertifying successfully without a gap in benefits. Families’ primary reasons for exiting the subsidy program included changes to their childcare needs (e.g., COVID disruptions or children aging into kindergarten), and changes to their eligibility due to increased income or leaving the workforce. Families reported that recertification was less burdensome when they received clear and consistent communication from eligibility workers or navigation support from their care providers. When subsidy benefits were lost, participants reported adverse consequences for their care arrangements and employment circumstances. They also described adverse outcomes of maintaining their eligibility, such as turning down pay increases.
Based on the assumption that language influences thinking, the present study investigated the effect of gender-fair language in German, a grammatically gendered language among primary school children. Specifically, in a single-study experiment, we compared 218 German third and fourth graders on the effects of the generic masculine (e.g.,der Polizist; English:the policeman) and gender-fair language in terms of the feminine and masculine form (e.g.,die Polizistin/der Polizist; English:the policewoman/the policeman) on the cognitive representation of women in stereotypically masculine occupations and occupational self-efficacy. General self-efficacy was examined as a moderator variable, assumed to influence the effect of gender-fair language on occupational self-efficacy. The results indicate that the gender-fair form led to a higher cognitive representation of women in stereotypically masculine occupations for girls and increased girls’ occupational self-efficacy for stereotypically masculine occupations. In contrast, the use of gender-fair language did not significantly influence boys’ cognitive representation of women and their occupational self-efficacy. General self-efficacy did not affect the effect of gender-fair language on occupational self-efficacy. Thus, even as early as in primary school, gender-fair language could help attracting girls to stereotypically masculine occupations.
The rapid proliferation of digital media has significantly transformed childhood experiences, necessitating an understanding of its impact on preschoolers’ development. This study illuminates the nature of YouTube interactions among preschool-aged children, underlining the importance of this research in the broader context of digital media’s role in early childhood. Addressing a vital gap, the work explores how these interactions influence aspirations and consumer behavior within a Turkish cultural framework. Employing semi-structured interviews, data was meticulously gathered from 25 parent-child pairs, providing a narrative-driven exploration into digital engagement. The findings reveal a dual-faceted impact: children exhibited emotional responses and altered aspirations post-YouTube exposure, with a marked inclination towards consumerism influenced by digital content. This underscores the potency of social learning through digital platforms. However, the research scope was confined to a specific locale, necessitating caution when extending conclusions beyond this demographic. The results prompt a reevaluation of parental mediation practices, suggest potential for educational integration of digital media, and advocate for the necessity of culturally attuned digital content regulation. Implications for future research include diversifying methodologies and participant demographics to further substantiate the findings and expand their applicability.
Over the last 15 years, many European countries have experienced fertility declines. Existing research on this shift in fertility behavior points to economic aspects and increased levels of uncertainty as important drivers. However, in this debate little attention has been paid to how the relevance of individual- and contextual-level dimensions for understanding the new fertility patterns varies by level of urbanization. This is surprising given that urban and rural areas not only differ strongly in fertility timing and levels, but also in economic conditions. Our paper fills this important research gap by analyzing rich register data from Finland using multi-level event history models to study the transition to first birth among younger (under age 30) and older (ages 30 or older) women. We show that urban–rural differences in the transition to parenthood are particularly pronounced among younger women. In addition, the results indicate that economic circumstances and related uncertainties are more relevant for understanding first births probabilities for younger women than older women. Finally, among younger women, the relevance of economic circumstances and related uncertainties seems to be most relevant in the capital region of Helsinki and urban areas compared to semiurban and rural areas. Our findings underline that the urban–rural dimension should receive more attention in research on fertility in times of uncertainty.
While improving teachers’ questioning skills and techniques should be the primary focus in professional development, it is equally crucial for teachers to help children recognize that some questions are more effective for learning than others and that asking with a purpose leads to a deeper understanding. Well-formulated questions and the ability to discern which questions are worth posing are also essential components of developing into an autonomous learner and decision-maker. The collaborative case study presented here, conducted by a university researcher and an early childhood teacher, responded to calls for research into children’s questions across diverse cultural contexts and with a variety of methodologies. Through qualitative data collection and analysis over a five-month period, the study had the advantage of tracking the learning journey of a group of 4- and 5-year-olds in a Greek early childhood setting, from repeating each other’s questions to asking purposeful questions in various contexts and documenting how children’s questioning skills were co-constructed in context. Through examples of critical incidents and samples of children’s efforts, the paper discusses the strategies that supported children in posing more effective questions and illustrates how the surrounding conversational and social environment can facilitate the improvement of question-asking.
Although numerous studies have investigated the psychological outcomes of peer victimization, little is known about differences in the negative effects of traditional victimization and cyber victimization, especially among left-behind and non-left-behind adolescents in rural China. We aimed to examine a model explaining how traditional victimization and cyber victimization influence suicidal ideation mediated by emotional distress in rural China, with left-behind status as a moderator. Data were collected via random, multistage, stratified-cluster sampling in schools in a rural region of Hunan province, China. The sample included 697 adolescents in Grades 7–9 (boys = 53.8%). Structural equation modeling and multigroup comparison analysis were performed to test a pre-formulated conceptual model. In the full sample, both traditional and cyber victimization were associated with students’ emotional distress, which was also associated with suicidal ideation. Among left-behind adolescents, only traditional victimization was associated with emotional distress and suicidal ideation. For non-left-behind adolescents, both traditional victimization and cyber victimization were significantly associated with emotional distress, and cyber victimization’s association with emotional distress was even slightly stronger than traditional victimization’s. Our study expands the current understanding of the differential effects of traditional and cyber victimization among subgroups of children. The findings further suggest that the focus should not be solely on left-behind children; the psychological health of non-left-behind children also warrants attention. Additionally, the study provides considerable implications for practice.
Occupational burnout is a concern for the health of clergy and musicians and the longevity of their careers. However, no known study has assessed occupational burnout among pastoral musicians in the United States. Therefore, the aims of this paper were to (1) describe pastoral musicians as a population, (2) identify the prevalence rate of burnout among pastoral musicians, and (3) investigate the relationship between pastoral musicians’ burnout and religious coping. In 2021, an online questionnaire designed to assess burnout among pastoral musicians was disseminated via email to members of the Hymn Society of North America and via social media to collect data from pastoral music directors in the United States. The survey yieldedN= 1,050 respondents. Of these, 83.8% experienced one or more symptoms of burnout (41.3% with low efficacy; 12.4% with high emotional exhaustion; 21.3% with high cynicism; 8.8% with burnout). Ineffectiveness was positively correlated with negative religious coping. Emotional exhaustion and cynicism were positively correlated with negative religious coping. This study contributes quantitative analysis to pastoral musician research. Findings demonstrate that burnout is prevalent among American pastoral musicians. More research is needed to investigate solutions for burnout among this population.Keywords: church musician, performance-related health problems (PRHPs), clergy, musicians’ health, performing arts health, burnout.
As the caregivers and educators of young children, kindergarten teachers often have to make spontaneous decisions and deal with challenging situations on a daily basis. The well-being of kindergarten teachers is of interest to parents, teacher trainers, and policymakers, as whether kindergarten teachers do well physically, psychologically, and occupationally has important implications for young children—the future pillars of society. Therefore, it is important to examine factors that may contribute to our understanding of the well-being of kindergarten teachers. This cross-sectional study examined whether mindfulness was linked to Chinese kindergarten teachers’ physical, psychological, and occupational well-being and tested self-compassion as a mediator. Online questionnaire data were collected from 336 kindergarten teachers working in Hong Kong, China (mean age = 31.6 years; 86% of them were women). Kindergarten teachers rated their physical well-being (indicated by physical health and voice disorder symptoms), psychological well-being (indicated by life satisfaction and depressive symptoms), and occupational well-being (indicated by job satisfaction and turnover intentions) as well as their mindfulness and self-compassion. Structural equational modeling revealed that mindfulness was associated with all three aspects of well-being and self-compassion mediated such associations. Theoretically, findings highlighted the multidimensional nature of kindergarten teachers’ well-being and the roles of intrapersonal factors—such as mindfulness and self-compassion—in understanding it. Practically, findings pointed to the potential utility of supporting kindergarten teachers’ well-being by targeting their mindfulness and self-compassion.
Parental overprotection is thought to be a risk factor for childhood anxiety disorders. The Parental Overprotection Measure (POM) is a self-assessment scale that has been used in many studies, however, no article has comprehensively explored its psychometric properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the POM to secure reliable, replicable, and comparable results. Using an item-response theoretical framework, we aimed to address five basic criteria of psychometric quality: one-dimensionality, ordered response categories, invariance, targeting, and reliability. Furthermore, we aimed to identify and exclude any items that did not contribute significantly, to create a concise and practical scale. A total of 1092 parents of children aged 4–12 years were recruited through an online advertisement and completed an anonymous online survey during September and October 2020. Out of the 19 items of the original scale, eight were excluded due to unsatisfactory psychometric properties and/or because of not being judged by experts as harmonious with the concept of parental overprotection. The retained items constituted the POM-11, a brief scale with sound psychometric properties that has the potential for use in both research and clinical settings.
Previous research shows that female workers are less sensitive to wages in their decision to switch jobs than male workers, and that this could explain a substantial part of the gender wage gap. This paper studies to what extent gender differences in preferences and personality traits explain the gender gap in the wage-elasticity of job-to-job transitions in the labor market. Using a novel decomposition approach in the context of mediated moderation and using German Socio-Economic Panel Survey (G-SOEP) data for the period 2005–2019, we find that gender differences in risk preferences, patience, trust, reciprocity, altruism, conscientiousness, ambition and self-esteem explain about 25% of the gender gap in wage-elasticities of job separations. A detailed decomposition suggests that risk preferences, trust and ambition contribute most to this gender gap in wage-elasticity.
I study the association between task content of jobs and mothers’ employment transitions after the first birth in Germany. I construct measures of task content of jobs using data from the Employment Survey conducted by the German Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BiBB). These indicators illustrate the career cost of children and how it is impacted by the technology- and globalization-driven labour market change. The measures are then linked to high-quality individual register data from the German Pension Fund (FDZ-RV) covering the years 2012–2020. Utilizing competing risk models, I show that women engaged in occupations with analytic and interactive task content, which are in high demand and incompatible with maternity-related employment breaks, are the most likely to transition to employment after their first birth. Conversely, women with occupations intense in routine tasks, which are more susceptible to automation or trade competition, are more likely to experience unemployment.
PurposeItem response theory (IRT) models are an increasingly popular method choice for evaluating clinical outcome assessments (COAs) for use in clinical trials. Given common constraints in clinical trial design, such as limits on sample size and assessment lengths, the current study aimed to examine the appropriateness of commonly used polytomous IRT models, specifically the graded response model (GRM) and partial credit model (PCM), in the context of how they are frequently used for psychometric evaluation of COAs in clinical trials.MethodsData were simulated under varying sample sizes, measure lengths, response category numbers, and slope strengths, as well as under conditions that violated some model assumptions, namely, unidimensionality and equality of item slopes. Model fit, detection of item local dependence, and detection of item misfit were all examined to identify conditions where one model may be preferable or results may contain a degree of bias.ResultsFor unidimensional item sets and equal item slopes, the PCM and GRM performed similarly, and GRM performance remained consistent as slope variability increased. For not-unidimensional item sets, the PCM was somewhat more sensitive to this unidimensionality violation. Looking across conditions, the PCM did not demonstrate a clear advantage over the GRM for small sample sizes or shorter measure lengths.ConclusionOverall, the GRM and the PCM each demonstrated advantages and disadvantages depending on underlying data conditions and the model outcome investigated. We recommend careful consideration of the known, or expected, data characteristics when choosing a model and interpreting its results.
Background and ObjectivesFamilies of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) have reported to benefit from social, emotional, and informational support from other families (peer support) with similarly affected children. Pediatric subspecialists often serve as the primary medical providers for CSHCN, as well as educators for these children’s families. The extent to which subspecialists refer families to sources of peer support is unknown.MethodsA statewide online survey of California pediatric subspecialists investigated opinions about the potential value and challenges of peer support. Data was obtained on the frequency with which families in their practices were referred to peer support, practice characteristics, and personal demographics. Weighted data, descriptive statistics, and regression models were used to characterize and predict factors affecting referral services.ResultsThere were 388 respondents, a response rate of 14.5%. Subspecialists were generally unfamiliar with peer support resources in their communities, but many more knew of peer support programs in their institutions. Most (> 85%) held positive views about peer support, though only 40% of practices often referred families for such support. Individual opinions did not predict practice referral processes for peer support which were more influenced by knowledge of resources, and availability of time, staffing, and institutional peer support resources.ConclusionOffering referral to peer support services is compatible with pediatric subspecialty care. Educating physicians about available resources, assigning responsibility, providing staff time for referring families, and incorporating parent mentors into subspecialty practices can increase access. Future studies of families’ referral experiences are needed.
Contraceptive use is the most effective means of preventing unintended pregnancies among sexually active individuals. Foreign-born women are less likely to use contraception when compared to US-born women. However, there are limited studies focused on understanding factors that influence contraceptive use among foreign-born women in the US. This study aimed to explore the factors associated with contraceptive use in the early reproductive lives of foreign-born women in the US. This study utilized the 2017-2019 National Survey on Family Growth to conduct a cross-sectional secondary data analysis. Analyses were restricted to observations from 708 women who identified as foreign-born, were aged 15-49 years, and provided information about their first pregnancies. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression were used to assess the factors influencing contraceptive use. 70.9% of the participants had used a form of contraception in the period leading to their first pregnancy. Multivariable regression analysis identified significant predictors of contraceptive use: educational level, age, religion, income levels, health insurance, and race/ethnicity. Those with a religious affiliation and were 25 years and above had greater odds of contraceptive use while non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic other/multiple race participants had lower odds of contraceptive use. Based on the predictors identified, public health interventions should be tailored to address specific socio-demographic factors that influence contraceptive decisionmaking among foreign-born women in the US. Additionally, understanding the disparities in contraceptive use across racial/ethnic backgrounds underscores the need for culturally sensitive approaches that acknowledge and respect diverse beliefs surrounding contraception.
BackgroundThe transferability of health policies in the European Union (EU) faces challenges due to economic, political, and healthcare system factors, including cross-country differences in health preferences. In order to aid policymaking, previous research has grouped EU countries based on geographical proximity or literature-based criteria, but not on health preference data. The EQ-5D-5L instrument, which measures health-related quality of life and reflects unique national health preferences shaped by cultural and social factors, is used to evaluate policies, technologies and interventions, but has not been used to group countries. Thus, this study aims to identify clusters of EU-27 countries with similar preference patterns using published EQ-5D-5L value sets.MethodsHierarchical agglomerative clustering was employed on 13 EU-27 countries’ EQ-5D-5L value sets, first analyzing regression coefficients for each dimension-level and then creating a simulated coefficient distribution considering uncertainty.FindingsFive clusters of EU-27 countries emerged: (1) Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, Germany); (2) Hungary, Italy, Portugal; (3) Poland, Romania; (4) France, Spain; (5) Denmark, Ireland. All clusters except cluster 5 gave higher importance to “Pain and Discomfort”; all clusters except cluster 1 gave less importance to “Usual Activities”. “Anxiety and Depression” and “Pain and Discomfort” had the largest heterogeneity in valuation across severity level.InterpretationIdentified clusters of countries with distinct health preferences provide insights for health policy transferability in the EU. Recognizing countries with similar health preferences can aid EU policymaking and transferability efforts, particularly in early-stage policymaking, while also fostering closer collaboration on health policy decisions and best practice sharing. Further development of national value sets within the EU is necessary for a more accurate representation.
Interpersonal and intergroup relationships seem to have steadily deteriorated in recent years, with an increase in the lack of civility and decency along with a greater willingness to attack and cancel anyone who does not agree with one’s cherished perspective on numerous matters. New popular phrases such as cancel culture, public shaming, air rage, and gaslighting have entered the common vernacular. Ignatian spirituality offers several helpful strategies for dealing with these contemporary divisive conflicts in a productive manner. These include (1) seeing God (or the sacred) in all things, (2) striving towards kinship with others through the pathway of civility, hospitality, and solidarity, and (3) managing conflict with accommodation, humility, and the expectation of goodness in mind. This article introduces and provides examples of these three Ignatian principles that can be employed in all challenging relationships, including both personal and professional as well as psychotherapeutic ones. They can be utilized in a secular or spiritually minded manner as well. Having more tools to improve relationships is especially needed now.
Classmates’ academic and executive function (EF) skills are important predictors of individual EF and achievement. The present study investigated the effects of peer EF, using a battery of measures, on individual EF and academic achievement in preschool. Peer effects were assessed for 321 preschool-aged children from 48 classrooms. Using hierarchical linear modeling, peer EF predicted student gains in executive function, vocabulary, and math, but not literacy. Results suggested that classrooms with higher overall EF had students who achieved more skills over the course of the school year in comparison to children in classrooms with lower levels of EF. The effect of fall peer EF on spring student EF was greater for low-income dual language learners (DLLs) than monolinguals. Findings suggest that EF, math, and vocabulary knowledge are socially mediated by peers and can have differential effects on DLLs.
ObjectivesLittle is known about the efficacy of remotely delivered outcome measures (psychological/health-related assessments) in a signed language for Deaf people. The objective is to explore the equivalence of two modes of remote delivery of health-related quality of life outcome measures in British Sign Language (BSL): asynchronous online assessment versus synchronous live face-to-face online assessment in sign language.MethodsThirty-one participants were recruited through Deaf networks and sign language media. Measures used were validated BSL versions of the EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS and CORE-10. A randomised, crossover trial was conducted between March and May 2023 with seventeen first receiving asynchronous assessment and sixteen first receiving synchronous live online assessment. This study explored whether the outcomes of the two assessments are equivalent regardless of modality of delivery. Demographic data were collected, and eight participants took part in semi-structured qualitative interviews exploring modality preferences and the impact of each modality.ResultsThe mean difference between pre-recorded and live modes was 0.034 for EQ-5D-5L BSL (90% CI 0.015–0.051), 4.33 mean difference for EQ-VAS BSL (90% CI 0.697–8.083), and mean difference of 0.17 for CORE-10 BSL (90% CI − 1.4065 to 1.1775). The confidence intervals for each of the EQ-5D-5L BSL, EQ-VAS BSL, and CORE-10 BSL lie within the prespecified equivalence margins which suggested that the two modes are equivalent.ConclusionThe results demonstrate that EQ-5D-5L BSL, EQ-VAS BSL, and CORE-10 BSL may be considered as equivalent across modes of remote delivery. This further strengthens the validation of existing standardised assessments in BSL.A BSL version of the abstract is available in Supplementary Video 1.
The lack of health insurance coverage is one of the most serious challenges confronting refugees and an important public policy issue. This study examines how refugees’ human and social capital is linked to their health insurance coverage. This study uses the 2020 Annual Survey of Refugees public use data file to test the relationship between refugees’ human and social capital and their health insurance coverage. 770 refugees who entered the U.S. between 2015 and 2019 are included in the sample. Health insurance coverage is measured in three different levels: no coverage at all, coverage with a gap, and coverage all year long. This study employs an ordered probit regression. The findings show that refugees’ human capital, regardless of whether it is from refugees’ home country or the U.S., is not associated with health insurance coverage. However, refugees’ social capital, in terms of their involvement in religious organizations and their informal bridging network with people from a different culture, is positively associated with coverage. The analysis also reveals a gap in coverage once the initial government assistance ends, and refugees’ paid employment and household income are negatively associated with health insurance coverage. The findings suggest that refugees’ social capital in the new country plays an important role in obtaining the necessary information for healthcare access while the positive impacts of human capital on healthcare access may not apply to the refugee population. Therefore, resettlement programs should place an emphasis on helping refugees build and enhance social connections with people of diverse cultural backgrounds.
The representation of motherhood using digital platforms, which we call sharenting, can shape the socially constructed motherhood identity, i.e., supermoms in modern societies. Despite building a positive identity as mothers, supermoms may unintentionally violate their children’s privacy, instrumentalise, and even monetise the children. We examine sharenting and supermom identities as manifestations of neoliberal repositioning women as mothers and employees with little consideration of their unarticulated struggles. Drawing on a netnographic study of social media practices, we analysed fifteen working supermom accounts with over two hundred thousand followers, where child-related content was shared and posted between 2019 and 2023. We find that sharenting is often employed to construct the identity of supermoms, yet it frequently leads to the exploitation of children for profit-driven purposes, thereby increasing their vulnerability. We contribute to the literature by offering empirical evidence that the supermom identity is a by-product of the neoliberal system, which normalises time-intensive demands on women in the workplace and caregiving roles. Furthermore, we highlight the adverse consequences of sharenting and provide critical insights into the privacy and security risks associated with child-related digital content.
U.S. immigrant parents encounter various challenges during the migration and resettlement process, such as acculturative stress and dissonance in parenting practices between the cultures in the U.S. and those in their country of origin. Although studies have established a link between increased perceived stress and reduced parenting self-efficacy in U.S.-born parents, which could be alleviated by levels of parental empowerment, little is known about this pathway in the context of migration. Guided by the Family Adjustment and Adaptation Response Model and with a focus on low-income immigrant parents of young children, we examined (1) the association between perceived stress and parenting self-efficacy, and (2) whether parental empowerment constitutes a buffer between perceived stress and parenting self-efficacy. Participants included foreign-born, low-income parents (n= 680) with preschool-aged children enrolled in Head Start of Greater Boston. Linear regression models were conducted to examine the relationship between perceived stress and parenting self-efficacy. An interaction term between perceived stress and empowerment was included to test the moderating effect of each dimension of parental empowerment (i.e., resource empowerment, critical awareness, and relational empowerment). Results showed higher perceived stress was associated with lower parenting self-efficacy and this relationship was moderated by relational empowerment. Findings suggest that relational empowerment can be an important resource for immigrant parents with high stress and a protective factor to improve self-efficacy in their parenting. These results pose important implications regarding how healthcare professionals and clinicians may support parents, for example, through the development of culturally sensitive parenting interventions and the creation of safe environments for parent-to-parent relationships.
There is a long history of political violence in the United States. Scholars have documented numerous dispositions that predict support for violence as a political tactic, finding that a general tendency toward aggression is consistently among the strongest predictors. Yet, we know much less about how political attitudes might activate aggressive personalities and direct them toward specific targets. In this paper, we examine how policy attitudes interact with dispositional aggression to motivate support for political violence. Across two studies, using novel measures and within-subjects designs, we show that intense policy opposition strongly predicts support for aggressive political tactics against politicians responsible for the legislation – primarily among those who are dispositionally prone to aggression. Surprisingly, the strength of partisan identity plays little role in explaining support for political aggression. Our findings suggest that policy attitudes are a crucial factor for understanding when aggressive individuals might turn to political violence.
More than merely policy, neoliberalism shapes how teachers relate to their students and classrooms. This article seeks to make visible how neoliberalism functions to form and deform teacher’s subjectivities (and in turn their pedagogical practices) through an analysis of the experiences of two teachers within an accountability-constrained elementary school. Using data generated within an ethnographically-informed case study, we draw on discourse analytic and post-qualitative methodologies, in conversation with critical theorizing of neoliberalism, to examine how teachers’ subjectivities were fractured as they worked to simultaneously meet the demands of neoliberal accountability and the humanizing aims of their pedagogical philosophies. We describe three archetypes—the neoliberal pragmatist, the student advocate, and the humanizing pedagogue—constructed to represent the varied approaches taken by teachers in their attempts to reconcile these conflicting aims. Then, through two vignettes of classroom practice, we illustrate how neoliberal logics and policies compelled these teachers to balance competing subjectivities, resulting in those teachers enacting extensive test preparation that contradicted their pedagogical philosophies. Through this analysis, we argue that fragmentation of teachers’ subjectivities within neoliberalism functions to effectively keep teachers off balance in their attempts to both respond to and resist neoliberal educational reforms, resulting in a maintenance of the neoliberal order.
This article examines how teachers use sponsorship to foster Black student academic success. Sponsorship is understood to be tailored, active support from influential teachers that promote academic success. The article examines a central question: “how do teachers use sponsorship to foster Black student success?” The author uses data from an ethnographic case study of high schools in a metropolitan area in the Midwest United States and draws on Critical Race Theory to inform the study. The author reconceptualizes sponsorship as a process termed sifting for success. Findings show sifting for success involves three components: (a) centering a systematic exclusion of Black people; (b) removing barriers to academic success; and (c) positioning some students as academic afterthoughts. The author details tensions that emerge as teachers use sponsorship to benefit Black students. The article concludes with a discussion of the findings and offers implications for future inquiries.
ObjectiveGlobally, obstetric hemorrhage and trauma are the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality during pregnancy. Delivering high-quality medical care to these patients is therefore imperative.This study aims to examine the relationship between month of referral and the severity of emergency admissions among pregnant women referred for obstetric hemorrhage and trauma.Materials and MethodsA retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted on hospital records of 1,684 pregnant women admitted to the case emergency center at Imam Reza Hospital in Mashhad, Iran for hemorrhage or trauma between January and December 2016. Secondary data extracted from the hospital information system (HIS) were used to calculate frequencies for patient demographics (age, insurance type), clinical characteristics (admission type, emergency severity, injury cause, referral reason) and external factors (month of referral). Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between the month of referral and emergency severity (urgent/non-urgent) for hemorrhage and trauma.ResultsHemorrhage during pregnancy (n= 1,636, 97.1%) was the most prevalent reason for referral throughout the year. The month of referral was significantly associated with emergency severity (P< 0.001). Compared to March, the odds of urgent referrals were notably higher in August (OR 3.822), October (OR 5.084), and November (OR 4.720).ConclusionA peak in emergency referrals were observed during the summer and fall months, with October having the highest number of referrals for obstetric hemorrhage and trauma.
In this study, we measured attitudes, beliefs, and intentions about implementing outdoor learning experiences among 56 early childhood professionals before and after attending Growing Up WILD™ (GUW) training. Online pre- and post-surveys were distributed to participants measuring a range of attitudes (i.e., comfort and confidence), beliefs, and intentions (i.e., planning). Overall, after attending GUW training, participants reported feeling more confident facilitating conversations with children about nature and science and more comfortable about planning teacher directed activities, allowing children to take risks, and offering free play. They also expressed fewer concerns about potential barriers to going outside such as family concerns, materials, and curriculum. It also demonstrated participants had greater intentions to engage children in outdoor learning experiences (e.g., outdoor field trips and nature walks). Our findings highlight the impact that GUW training, a brief intervention, can have on early childhood professionals’ attitudes, beliefs, and intentions toward implementing outdoor education. We hope that these attitudinal shifts will encourage early childhood professionals to take young children outside so they can enjoy the benefits of outdoor education.
Compared to global lobbying hubs like the USA and the European Union and to its neighboring countries, Switzerland hardly regulates legislative lobbying, i.e., lobbying that targets the legislative branch. Only three types of legal provisions apply to lobbying in the Swiss legislature: First, legislators must disclose their ties to interest groups. Second, access to the parliamentary building is limited and granted at the discretion of each legislator, who may give an entry pass to two individuals of his or her choice. Third, legislative lobbying is illegal if it violates the criminal law provisions on bribery. Proposals to enact more comprehensive regulation have failed, often after several years of legislative debate. Pursuant to the classification proposed by Chari et al. (Regulating Lobbying: A Global Comparison, 2nd ed., Manchester University Press, Manchester, 2019), the Swiss legal framework governing legislative lobbying qualifies as a ‘low-robustness’ regime at best. Yet, Switzerland ranks high in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (6/180 in 2023). Is more extensive regulation superfluous or overdue in Switzerland? While the Swiss legal and political order is exceptional in some respects, these characteristics do not justify ‘Swiss exceptionalism’ with regard to the regulation of legislative lobbying, as some of these specificities pose distinctive threats that the law needs to tackle.
Early writing includes both transcription skills (e.g., handwriting and spelling) and composing skills (e.g., the generation, manipulation, and translation of ideas into writing), yet early composing is not as well understood in academic research or by classroom educators. This study seeks to understand 1) how children retained or modified core idea units from pre-writing verbalizations to post-writing verbalizations and 2) how these transformations are related to other composing components, such as connection of ideas. Participants in this study included 133 children at the end of their prekindergarten year. Children completed two composing tasks related to planning a birthday party: an Invitation task and a List task, in which they were asked what they planned to write before writing and then what they had written after writing. Results indicate that most children’s pre- and post-verbalizations were connected in meaning. While children overwhelmingly modified their core ideas on both tasks, more children retained ideas on the List task than the Invitation task. Children most often concurrently added and deleted ideas on both tasks, but did so less often when pre- and post-verbalizations were connected in meaning. Implications for supporting the complete writing process, from planning to review and revision, in classroom practices as well as further directions for research are discussed.
Cultural consonance, defined as the extent to which one is able to approximate a given cultural model in one’s own life, is a highly adaptive theory and method which anthropologists have used for decades to demonstrate direct connections between individuals’ variation in relation to meaning systems and their health outcomes. However, it has been limited by use of a “cultural consonance score” which treats cultural consonance unidimensionally. Because people enact cultural models in multiple ways, cultural consonance may be better operationalized multidimensionally. Applying correspondence analysis to young South Korean men’s responses to a cultural consonance scale measuring their approximation of the local ideal male body, cultural consonance is rather demonstrated to be a multiplicity. In the case of South Korean men’s body ideals, two dimensions—men’s overall attractiveness and whether they pursue a “flower boy” or a “beastly man” embodiment—are identified. These two dimensions are also significantly associated with university prestige and sexual identity, and predict disordered eating beyond body dissatisfaction. These data suggest that well-being in relation to cultural consonance is a product of its assemblage: both of degree of approximation of a cultural model and the manner by which individuals enact it.
Navigating the vast sea of information in the digital age poses significant challenges, especially when it comes to discerning fake news from authentic information. This intricate task becomes even more challenging when the fake news is artfully presented as truth. Fake news often disguises itself as credible content and, by rapidly proliferating on digital platforms, contributes to increasing information disorder. This paper aims to investigate how the fake news phenomenon and its related issues have been addressed in the scientific literature. To achieve this objective, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of 3098 scientific publications extracted from the Web of Science from 2005 to 2022. This approach allowed us to identify the conceptual structure of fake news, including the different themes, and understand how they are interconnected in the field of fake news study. Additionally, we examined the intellectual structure based on the co-citations of key journals addressing this topic. The results of this research revealed an increase in the volume of fake news publications, coinciding with a rise in citations among the authors of the selected articles. Furthermore, we found that the conceptual structure of fake news is characterised by an interdisciplinary nature, which revolves mainly around sociopolitical dynamics and public health, with the latter particularly influenced by the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the intellectual structure uncovered by the journals’ co-citation network highlights the presence of two main subfields: communication and political debate and the behavioural domain.
This paper examines the impact of children’s urban-to-urban migration on their parents’ health. Our findings indicate that children’s urban-to-urban migration significantly reduces the self-assessed health ratings of left-behind parents, increases the incidence of chronic diseases, and elevates levels of depression among them. However, there is no evidence of impacts on the left-behind parents’ activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, or memory functions. The overall decline in the parental health is mainly caused by the absence of daily care and emotional comfort, while the achievements of children may mitigate this negative shock to some extent. In addition, economic support provided by children’s urban-to-urban migration does not significantly impact parental health, which is related to the higher asset endowment possessed by urban parents. Furthermore, the negative impact of daughters’ urban-to-urban migration on parents is primarily reflected in physical health, while that of sons is mainly reflected in mental health. Additionally, the negative impact of urban-to-urban migration on the health of left-behind parents is more pronounced in the sub-samples of children who are financially dependent on their parents and left-behind parents with lower assets.
We propose a synthesis of the independent scientific frameworks of economic complexity and urban scaling into a consistent mechanism—city complexity—to measure multi-dimensional fitness of cities. Essentially, we use deviations from scaling law for a given set of urban outcomes as the basis to construct a bipartite city-outcome matrix. This matrix forms the input into the economic complexity methodology, which iterates over a pair of coupled non-linear maps, computing fitness of cities and complexity of outcomes. We test our algorithm with data from American cities and find that the emergent city fitness measure is consistent with expected behavior across the set of outcomes studied. We also find temporal evolution of city fitness and outcome complexity to be in agreement with theoretical expectation. Finally, we perturb the metrics to conditions of widespread socioeconomic stress and find that outcomes are indicative of the robustness of thecity complexityalgorithm. Overall, these findings suggest that thecity complexitymechanism proposed here produces systematic, self-consistent metrics and can be applied across any set of diverse outcomes, irrespective of the specifics of national urban contexts.
PurposeOur objectives were to identify characteristics of response shift studies using patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) that explain variability in (1) the detection and (2) the magnitude of response shift effects.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of quantitative studies published before June 2023. First, two-level multivariable logistic regression models (effect- and sample-levels) were used to explain variability in the probability of finding a response shift effect. Second, variability in effect sizes (standardized mean differences) was investigated with 3-level meta-regression models (participant-, effect- and sample-levels). Explanatory variables identified via the purposeful selection methodology included response shift method and type, and population-, study design-, PROM- and study-quality characteristics.ResultsFirst, logistic regression analysis of 5597 effects from 206 samples in 171 studies identified variables explaining 41.5% of theeffect-levelvariance, while no variables explainedsample-levelvariance. The average probability of response shift detection is 0.20 (95% CI: 0.17-0.28). Variation in detection was predominantly explained by response shift methods and type (recalibration vs. reprioritization/reconceptualization). Second, effect sizes were analyzed for 769 effects from 114 samples and 96 studies based on the then-test and structural equation modeling methods. Meta-regression analysis identified variables explaining 11.6% of the effect-level variance and 26.4% of the sample-level variance, with an average effect size of 0.30 (95% CI: 0.26-0.34).ConclusionResponse shift detection is influenced by study design and methods. Insights into the variables explaining response shift effects can be used to interpret results of other comparable studies using PROMs and inform the design of future response shift studies.
Throughout the years, immigration has been a significant movement in the USA and leads to the examination of acculturative stress. By employing the acculturation stress and vulnerability models, the present study aimed to examine the association among acculturation stress, self-esteem, depression, family cohesion, and familism in first-generation immigrant children. Longitudinal data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS) were used. The analytical sample (n= 5262) was predominantly female (51.1%) and between the ages of 12 and 18 (M= 14.23) years old. SPSS 27 and AMOS 27 were utilized to conduct a path analysis to examine the relationships among acculturation stress, self-esteem, depression, family cohesion, and familism. Our results showed good fit (χ2/df ratio = 11.49; CFI = 0.91; RMSEA = 0.05, CI [.04, .05]) for the full path model. Acculturation stress had a significant, negative association with depression (β= − 0.12,p< .001); a significant, negative association with self-esteem (β= − 0.12,p< .001); and a significant, positive association with family cohesion (β= 0.60,p< .01) and the familism index (β= 0.05,p< .05). Acculturation stress was found to be predictive of self-esteem, depression, and family cohesion for first-generation immigrant children between the ages of 12 and 18 years old. This study provides general implications for how mental health providers can understand the struggles and provide culturally competent therapeutic services for children and their families.
Healthcare services and outcomes are often not evenly distributed across geographic regions. This study used the harmonized data from the Research on Early Life and Trends and Effects (RELATE) to compare the health outcomes of older adults across the North–South divide of Ghana and identify the factors underlying these differences. Although the literature indicates that the South has more health resources and better health indicators, the current study revealed that, for older adults, health outcome in the North was comparatively better than that in the South. The optimal health index scores show that older adults in the North are living at 86% of their optimal health compared with 82% in the South. Work-related physical activity and age substantially influenced optimal health in both regions. Additionally, healthcare use and gender were influential, particularly in the South. The results of the current study suggest that healthcare service availability can impact health outcomes, but so can behavioral and sociodemographic factors.
Access to health services is a multidimensional and multistage phenomenon. Despite the extensive development of the theoretical framework of access to health care, until now, no indices have been developed to measure all its dimensions and stages. In this work, we propose an index for measuring the multidimensional access to health services, considering nine dimensions of this phenomenon and a questionnaire format that allows obtaining information for its calculation and application. The proposed index is continuous, monotonic, and can be decomposed according to dimensions and services. At the same time, our index considers the subjectivity in the patient valuation of each dimension throughout the different stages of health access. As a case study, we applied the proposed methodology to a medium-sized city in Argentina, determining the relationship of the index with socioeconomic factors and its spatial distribution. Although no clear geographic pattern emerged from the results, statistically significant relationships were found with socioeconomic factors such as gender identity, educational level, activity status, and type of health insurance of the household head.
I estimate the effect of tightness on wages in Hungary and Slovakia. The Mortensen Pissarides model predicts a positive relationship but the empirical evidence is scarce.  I instrument tightness by the distance of a district from the Austrian border, interacted with a dummy that marks the opening of the Austrian labour market to these countries in 2011. I find a positive effect of tightness on wages, which is in line with the conclusion of the models. If tightness increase by 1 per cent than ceteris paribus wages increase by roughly 0.2 per cent both in Hungary and Slovakia as well.
Recent climate disasters serve as a reminder of the growing—yet overlooked—risk of climate-driven displacement in the Global North. This paper contributes to a nascent literature on disaster-induced mobility in high-income countries by extending the evidence to a new context: Australia. Applying propensity score matching to panel data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, we conduct the first causal assessment of the impact of home damage caused by extreme weather events on residential mobility in Australia. Our findings suggest that from 2009 to 2022, an annual average of 1.6% of Australians aged 15 + (or ~ 308,000 people a year) experienced home damage caused by floods, cyclones or bushfires. Such damage increases the probability of changing address within 1 year by 56%, displacing an annual average of 22,261 Australians. Cumulatively, this amounts to ~ 312,000 people displaced by climate-induced home damage between 2009 and 2022. Importantly, this type of climate-induced mobility is not evenly spread across the population. Contrary to findings from the Global South, we find no evidence of “entrapment effects”, except for uninsured homeowners. Instead, our results indicate that over 80% of climate-displaced Australians come from the bottom two income quartiles, with the poorest 3% accounting for 14% of the displaced population. The most disadvantaged Australians thus face a double vulnerability: they are both more likely to sustain home damage from extreme weather events and more likely to be displaced. These findings bear important implications for adaptation strategies and policy responses to natural disasters.
Emergent bilingual children with disabilities are represented across many student subgroups which are disproportionately affected by rigid disciplinary policies and behavioral support systems, as well as exclusionary policy implementation in general and special education. This qualitative study investigated how teachers read and enacted policies to correct, eliminate, or otherwise change emergent bilingual students’ behavior and social interactions in a culturally, racially, and linguistically diverse mid-sized urban school district. The findings of this study offer suggestions for teachers and teacher educators as they endeavor to disrupt inequitable outcomes of behavioral policies on emergent bilingual students with and without disabilities.
The paper examines the relationship between the settlement intentions of Ukrainian immigrants and structural integration measures implemented at the local level in Poland. For this purpose, the example of Lodz, a large city in central Poland where large immigration has recently taken place, is analysed. The study was based on a survey of the settlement plans of two Ukrainian immigrant groups: those who moved to Lodz for work or educational purposes (pre-war migrants) and those who found refuge there after Russia’s attack on Ukraine in 2022 (forced migrants). It showed that many Ukrainians were undecided about settling in Lodz, although the pre-war migrants were more willing to stay there than the refugees. Even though both groups have followed different paths of integration into Polish society due to the dissimilar periods of arrival, legal statuses and resources resulting from the distinct polices addressed to labour migrants and refugees, two hypotheses were formulated to verify the assumption that receiving public support and being employed positively impacted their settlement intentions. The analysis demonstrated a statistical correlation only between settlement plans and public support received by the pre-war migrants. Since they received less assistance than the refugees, their expectations in this regard were higher. In turn, the relationship between having a job and further settlement was statistically significant only for the refugees. The majority of pre-war migrants had a job and this factor did not determine their willingness to remain in Lodz so much. The research findings emphasised the importance of tailoring local policies to the needs of different immigrant groups, mainly in job placement, professional retraining, learning Polish or providing housing.
A growing body of evidence suggests that leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) impacts one’s mental health (MH) positively. The suggested MH benefits of LTPA may present a promising avenue to promote the MH of immigrants/refugees, who often face various stressors that may impede their MH. The CAN-HEAL study aimed to examine LTPA needs as they pertain to MH among Arab Canadians. The study adopted a collaborative community-based participatory research and integrated knowledge translation approach. Three methods were triangulated: qualitative interviews, Photovoice and a quantitative survey. A combination of sampling strategies (convenience, purposive and snowball) was utilized to recruit 60 socio-demographically diverse Arab Canadian participants. The study was informed by an integrated bio-psycho-socio-cultural framework. Although participants were knowledgeable of recommendations and MH benefits of LTPA, a high prevalence of physical inactivity (87%) was found. Intersections between age, gender, socio-economic and employment status, length of residency, and immigration status were associated with substantial LTPA inequities and negative MH within Arab communities. Older adults and low-income participants reportedsignificantlylower LTPA levels than younger adults and those with higher income. Female participants reported lower LTPA levels than their male counterparts. Study findings demonstrate that the LTPA-MH relationship among Arab Canadians is multi-faceted, with various LTPA-related bio-psycho-socio-cultural pathways/mechanisms influencing Arab Canadians’ MH. Intersectoral collaboration is required to implement a co-created community- and political-level action plan to address LTPA inequities and achieve health equity for Arab Canadians and other similar vulnerable groups.
In the last decade, Chile has experienced a significant increase in the number of international migrant families residing in the country. This emerging reality has had a profound impact on Chilean society, particularly within public schools where educators have not been adequately prepared to navigate an intercultural environment. As a response to this reality, two distinct strands of literature have emerged in this field: one highlighting the challenges faced by elementary teachers with immigrant students and addressing issues of racism and classism in their classrooms; the other, documenting exemplary practices employed by teachers to establish trustful relationships with their international migrant students. This research endeavors to enhance our understanding of teachers' motivations and practices addressing inequities for immigrant students, with a secondary goal of initiating a dialogue about classism and racism in Chile. Employing a hybrid qualitative methodology that combines case study and grounded theory, this study offers a detailed exploration of the motivations, practices, and representations of Chilean elementary teachers working with international migrant students. The findings concerning Chilean teachers' motivations reveal a powerful sense of empathy towards the life context of their immigrant students and a vocational commitment to teaching. Their efforts focus on the academic domain and extending beyond the school setting through visits to students and their families. Teachers' representations reflect the nuanced nature of racism in Chile, with some educators acknowledging its existence while others vehemently deny it. Additionally, teachers advocate for the development of welcoming protocols and increased government-school support for their new multicultural classrooms. Lastly, the unique characteristics of this group of elementary teachers are presented, emphasizing the necessity for their engagement with critical theories and a profound reflection on significant practices aimed at promoting social justice.
PurposeA number of studies have explored patients’ subjective experience of waiting for spinal surgery, however, they did so through an investigation conducted post-operatively. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the experience of patients while still on the waitlist for lumbar spinal arthrodesis.MethodsThis qualitative study of semi-structured interviews was conducted at an orthopedic research institute in Italy. The interview track was developed by a team of professionals (physiotherapists, orthopedic surgeon, psychologist) and consisted of 40 questions. Fifteen patients, 10 females and 5 males aged between 23 and 80 years, waiting for spinal arthrodesis were interviewed. The interviews were performed, transcribed and analyzed by the multiprofessional team through thematic analysis using a reflexive approach.ResultsFive main themes were generated:(1) Impact of persistent pain on patients’ physical and psychological functioning; (2) Fear of the unknown and uncertainties; (3) Hope and regaining normality; (4) The impact of the unpredictability of the waiting time; (5) Need for better communication and information on the care pathway. Two minor themes were also produced.ConclusionsThese findings highlighted that patients on the waiting list for spinal arthrodesis need more certainty about waiting times, better communication with hospital staff, more thorough information about their care pathway. This could help patients feel more confident and may lead to more adequate expectations before surgery.Trial RegistrationThe study protocol was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov database on 14/03/2022 with ID number NCT06323694.
Given the extensive duration and heightened uncertainties in lifestyles, migration may profoundly shape individuals’ life-course trajectories through its influence on one’s family life. Using a mixed-method approach, this study examines how migration influences divorce in China based on data from the 2012 China Family Panel Studies and 127 in-depth interviews conducted in 2015. Results show that migrant men are more likely to experience divorce than their non-migrant counterparts. The patterns are less salient for women and rural migrants, possibly attributed to the greater stigma associated with divorce among these groups than among their male and urban counterparts. Qualitative interviews reveal the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, more liberal attitudes and weaker social controls in the receiving communities than in their places of origin, limited time spent with their partners, and unstable lifestyles result in more divorces for migrants. To address potential selection bias, I estimate the treatment effects of migration based on propensity-score matching, and the results are consistent with the above findings.
PurposeTo assess the health related quality of life (HRQoL) and sexual function related to urinary incontinence (UI) severity among women with overweight or obesity.MethodsFrom September 2023 to January 2024, a cross-sectional was conducted among women seeking weight loss with overweight or obesity focusing on the symptoms and effects of UI. The degree of UI severity, UI-specific HRQoL, sexual function, and generic HRQoL were detected via Incontinence Modular Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF), Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-Short Form (IIQ-7), Short-form Prolapse Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12), and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions 5-Level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5 L) respectively.ResultsOut of 1205 valid responses, 564 (46.8%) reported UI with 354 classified as mild, 179 as moderate, and 31 as severe based on ICIQ-UI-SF scores. The mean age and body mass index of the respondents were 36.65 years and 29.9 kg/m², respectively. Individuals with more severe symptoms of UI exhibited correspondingly lower levels of UI-specific HRQoL, sexual function, and generic HRQoL. Although the correlations were weak, the severity of UI symptoms measured by ICIQ-UI-SF and IIQ-7 were significantly correlated with the mean utility values (r=-0.335, and − 0.351,P<0.001) of EQ-5D-5 L especially in the domains of anxiety/depression symptoms (r= 0.339 and 0.322,P<0.001).ConclusionNearly half of women seeking weight loss with overweight or obesity may experience UI, which significantly affects HRQoL and sexual function. The severity of UI symptoms is significantly correlated with the generic HRQoL measured by EQ-5D-5 L, especially in the domain of anxiety/depression symptoms.
IntroductionUrethral injuries are the most severe injuries caused by high-energy mechanisms such as traffic accidents, which have significant long-term serious consequences on the quality of life of the injured.ObjectivesExploration of lived experiences of urethral injury in traffic accident victims is the main goal of this study.MethodsThis is a phenomenological qualitative study among men suffering from urethral injuries due to traffic accidents and referred to hospitals for urethroplasty in Iran. Sixteen in-depth interviews were conducted with 15–59-year-old injured men from August 2022 to May 2023 using a semi-structured questionnaire at Shohada Hospital, considering maximum variation and achieving saturation. For data analysis, Colizzi’s analysis method was implemented in MaxQDA2020. Lincoln’s and Guba’s criteria were assessed to achieve the trustworthiness of the study.ResultsFive main themes emerged from the interviews: Urethral Injury resulting from traffic accidents as a Complex, Unknown Problem with a general lack of public awareness, Unpleasant Experience with Permanent Suffering from pain, shame, regret, isolation, Urethral Injury Causes Regret and Loss of Normalcy, Impact on Sexual and Social Identity, and its long-term consequences as neglected health and socio-economic issues are the unmet needs of the injured patients.ConclusionThe majority of expressions related to low public awareness and poor infrastructure. There are needs neglected by public services, especially health care services. Alongside wresting with these issues, considering policies to support this vulnerable people, and their well-being, quality of life and prevent further damage in terms of physical, social and mental health is an axiom.
How does newspaper-based event data compare to a government data source? While scholars have long recognized the importance of and biases present in newspaper-based event data, few studies have compared newspaper reports with official government data to better understand the severity and impact of such biases. We develop this comparison in the context of riots, a form of violent collective action that represents an important middle ground between peaceful protests and protracted civil conflict. Using newly collected police precinct-level government data from India, we compare these data to a high-quality newspaper source. Though similar at the aggregate level, newspaper riot reports correlate poorly with government data at the local level. We model the frequency of newspaper and government riot reports based on literacy, location, and other demographic characteristics to better understand the discrepancies between these two sources. We conclude that newspaper riot data does partially reflect aggregate riot trends, but the newspaper editorial process also plays an important role. Government data is better for within country comparisons and for analyzing event trends over time. Our findings suggest that using collective action event data from both sources may help ensure that results are not driven by biases in either data source.
Political science research has assessed how racial attitudes influence political behavior. However, less is known about the political effects of anti-Asian views, even as anti-Asian sentiment resurfaced during the pandemic. We theorize that the linkage of COVID-19 to Asian Americans by political elites activated anti-Asian animosity and shaped vote choice during the 2020 election. Using cross-sectional over time and panel data from the American National Election Studies, we find that holding more anti-Asian attitudes was not associated with Republican vote choice between 2008–2016, including when Donald Trump first ran. However, anti-Asian views became strongly related to voting for Trump in 2020. Further panel analysis demonstrates evidence that anti-Asian views measured prior in 2016 increased the likelihood of vote switching to the Republican Party in 2020. We conclude by discussing the potentially persisting political effects of anti-Asian attitudes in an environment continuously characterized by anti-Asian hate and especially during future election cycles that may feature increasingly diverse candidates of Asian heritage, running for elective office across various levels of government—including for the presidency. This study contributes to research on how and when racial attitudes influence political behavior and suggests, again, the centrality of race and ethnicity in American Politics.
A growing number of families in the US are caring for children with identified disabilities. As demonstrated in previous studies, there is reason to be concerned about the economic well-being of children with disabilities and their families. However, much of the existing evidence is drawn from older data that do not reflect recent increases in disability diagnoses or relevant economic and policy changes. Using recent nationally representative data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we offer updated evidence on the economic well-being of households of children with disabilities. Our regression models suggest that families with a child with a disability are more likely to experience food insecurity, and, on average, have lower income-to-poverty ratios than other households with children. We discuss implications for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers.
The effectiveness of governments in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic has been analyzed through numerous perspectives, including state authority, capacity, and legitimacy. In Hong Kong, incumbent political tensions and lack of trust in government potentially weakened public support for official Covid-19 mitigation measures, which included a government-mandated mobile application to monitor personal movements and contacts. This episode invites academic inquiry about public trust in policies and associated technology. Based on a 2022 survey of more than 5,000 residents, this study finds that support for Hong Kong’s LeaveHomeSafe application is associated with, among other factors, a predisposition to cooperate with government in sharing personal data. Several control variables, including age, social media use, and vaccination status, are also associated with support for the application. Trust in policies that use technology and data, and agreement that the government was effective in managing the spread of Covid-19, do not significantly associate with public support for the application. This study deepens scholarly understandings about the distinction between public trust in government and public trust in government technology, a topic of recent interest in the context of smart cities and rapid advancements in artificial intelligence.
Despite a lack of consensus on the most effective methods for measuring corruption, a variety of initiatives have been launched over the past decade. This paper contributes to the evolving field by arguing for the integration of frequency, cost, and local significance, into a three-dimensional approach for the development of enhanced metrics. After revisiting the history of corruption measurement, each proposed dimension is discussed by reference to past initiatives and the relevant literature. While the frequency and cost of corruption are discussed based on the varying degrees of attention received over the years, I propose that “significance” represents a third and necessary dimension, capturing the moral severity of corruption within different societal contexts. Taken as a unified whole, the proposed multidimensional approach is argued to have the potential for a more accurate depiction of corruption, enhancing also the clarity and accountability of corruption metrics. By accounting for frequency, cost, and significance, three-dimensional metrics are expected to lay the groundwork for more effective policy responses and deepen our understanding of the complexities inherent in the corruption phenomenon.
Based on the microdata from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), this paper empirically studies the impact of aging on household economic vulnerability from the asset allocation perspective. Households can be classified into four categories according to the allocation of liquid and non-liquid assets: P-HtM (poor hand-to-mouth), W-HtM (wealthy hand-to-mouth), P-nHtM (poor non-HtM) and W-nHtM (wealthy non-HtM). The results show that the elderly ratio will significantly amplify household economic vulnerability, and only W-HtM households can significantly alleviate this effect. The elderly ratio mainly enlarges household economic vulnerability by increasing health risks. Heterogeneity tests show that the impact of aging on household economic vulnerability is more pronounced for younger householders, midwest households, and non-stable employment households. The findings provide several policy implications for supervising and preventing household economic risks under the background of rapid aging in China.
The article addresses the tension between the internalization of a violent border regime intent on preempting migrant arrivals and the everyday democratic struggle against that regime. It builds on ethnographic fieldwork in Rome to illuminate conflicting political imaginations and existing practices of the already plural, albeit unequal, Italian polity. On the one hand, we see a bordered democracy. This democracy keeps investing in nationalizing itself, by fortifying the Mediterranean as a lethal border and by shoring up social, economic, and racialized boundaries. On the other hand, there is also an emerging migrant democracy. This migrant democracy actively works on two interrelated fronts: to build a more democratic, pluralistic, and egalitarian polity, and to reform how legal and physical access to the polity is governed in the first place. The article argues that, on both fronts, the anti-Fascist Constitution of Italy offers a viable political and ideological framework. More generally, the article proposes that if democratic politics and constitutional arguments are to produce more than a rhetorical edifice for democracy, they need to attend to the social, economic, and racialized inequalities of life in common.
There is no figure more controversial in Western sinology, and yet so little-known outside of it, than China scholar and CCP supporter Daniel A. Bell. This essay introduces Bell’s work to a general audience and engages him on questions central to Chinese and Western politics. Is the USA or China the greater danger to peace? What is the point of electoral politics? Is the CCP, for all its flaws, a virtuous party? Can any party be virtuous? How is the PRC best characterized conceptually? For instance, is it still a “totalitarian” regime or something quite different, as most China scholars assert? I chart Bell’s path to Confucianism before addressing his explanation of Western hostility to China. Bell’s critique of Western electoral democracy is then summarized, and his alternative to it evaluated. A penultimate section contrasts Bell’s approach to the PRC with that of another maverick foreign scholar, Simon Leys. The conclusion considers Bell’s perspective on history and anticipates his future writings on China.
Historians have predominantly examined the phenomenon of time through a qualitative lens. Historians typically regard the measurement of time utilisation and scarcity as more suited for analysing contemporary issues, where statistical data from surveys are readily available. It is widely assumed that the measurement of time is not a viable field of inquiry within social history and historical sociology due to the scarcity of sources. In this article, we challenge this assumption by adapting the methodology commonly employed by economic historians in studying absolute poverty to investigate time poverty indirectly. We introduce a novel indicator, the Temporal Deficit Ratio of Households, which focuses on household units rather than individual perspectives. We contend that this proposed methodology can be developed utilising information derived from traditional employment surveys, encompassing household composition, age, education, and causes of unemployment. Numerous underdeveloped and developing countries, particularly in Latin America and Asia, conducted such surveys during the latter half of the twentieth century. In the final stage of our research, we apply the proposed methodology to the case of Chile, which lacked time-use surveys during the twentieth century but possesses regular employment surveys dating back to 1957. Our analysis concludes that, between 1960 and 1995, despite rapid economic growth and a decrease in absolute income poverty, the availability of time for families to engage in personal care for working-age members and provide external care for dependents remained consistent.
Underserved communities were disproportionately affected during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Limited data exist on the impact of COVID-19 among refugee populations because refugee status is not often classified in electronic medical record (EMR) systems, unlike race or primary language. The study aim was to evaluate the PCR-based prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a delivering population over the first 2 years of the pandemic by refugee status, ethnicity, insurance, and vaccination status. A cross-sectional study examined parturient patients admitted to an urban safety-net hospital from May 2020 to May 2022 who were tested for SARS-CoV-2on admission. Percentages and prevalence ratios of SARS-CoV-2 between refugee status, insurance type, vaccination status, and race/ethnicity were calculated across four time periods, corresponding with variant surges of the pandemic. 3,502 patients delivered, 476 (13.6%) were refugees. Self-pay (46.4%) and Medicaid (46.4%) were the most frequent insurance types with a Hispanic predominance (64.5%) by race/ethnicity. Only 12.8% of patients received at least one vaccine before delivery: 13.2% in non-refugees versus 10.3% refugees 192 (5.5%) of the mothers tested positive during the study period with 6.1% refugees positive versus 5.4% among non-refugees, (prevalence ratio, 1.13;P= 0.53, 95% confidence interval [0.77, 1.66]). Positive tests ranged between 4.7% and 6.3% across insurance types and between 4.4% and 7.5% across race/ethnicity categories. The highest prevalence ratio (refugee/non-refugee) of 2.01 was during the Delta Surge (P= 0.12, 95% confidence interval [0.84, 4.82]) and the lowest prevalence ratio of 0.64 was during the Omicron Surge (P= 0.21, 95% CI [0.32, 1.30]). Among refugees when examined by primary language, 51.7% of positive tests were from those speaking languages of the African Great Lakes region (Kinyarwanda, Kirundi, Swahili, Kiswahili). We observed only small differences in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence between refugees and non-refugees or in vaccination status. Variations in prevalence ratio were seen by refugee status by variant surge. Subsets of the refugee population, when grouped by language/region, appeared to be more affected. This warrants future research on the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on specific refugee communities, rather than refugee communities as a heterogenous unit.
The 2021 assault on the United States (US) Congress was the result of a prolonged process in which dangerous forms of identification, solidarity, and restricted citizenship were activated among a significant segment of American society. Drawing upon five leading Mexican newspapers, this paper analyzes the efforts made within the Mexican civil sphere to control the meaning of the assault on the US Capitol. By doing so, this paper expands the scope of civil sphere theory by revealing the international connections among discourses in which civil and anti-civil semantics seek to translate the threats to democracy highlighted by this event. This translation represents an effort on the part of the distinct communicative and regulatory institutions to shape global semantics regarding the meaning of democracy. At an empirical level, our findings provide compelling evidence regarding the convergence between right-wing and left-wing illiberal strands in the public sphere. These contributions to civil sphere theory can draw researchers’ attention to the ways in which global disputes over events that occur in specific national spaces are constructed. Additionally, it broadens the analytical horizon for future research on civil dynamics in Latin America and other regions that face disputes over the meaning-making of contemporary democracies.
We followed the COVID-19 pandemic in Manaus, one of the epicenters of COVID-19 in Brazil, using an epidemiological mathematical model and made five main conclusions. First, in early 2022, the actual cases exceed officially reported data by up to 8 times. Second, despite vaccination campaigns, the collective immunity threshold necessary was insufficient to contain severe cases of COVID-19. Next, the low observed mortality demonstrated the effectiveness of vaccination. Next, the drop in the vaccination rate combined with immune escape by the Omicron sub-variants (BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5) resulted in new wave after November 2022. Finally, to minimize severe cases of COVID-19, we need to raise vaccination thresholds above 90–95% of the entire population including children aged 6 months and older and require booster doses at least in four-month intervals. This approach would help to prevent severe cases of COVID-19 that cause hospitalizations and deaths.
This study explored how seven Montessori teachers from across three countries perceive and practice literacy. One-on-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant over the 2022–23 school year. Qualitative analyses, in which interview transcripts were coded using an open-coding technique, revealed three themes about how Montessori teachers from Canada, Mexico, and Italy perceive and practice literacy: 1. Emphasis on oral language; 2. Explicit and systematic instruction; and 3. Literacy-rich environments. Understanding how Montessori teachers perceive and practice literacy can provide insight into the patterns of literacy learning across geographical contexts. In particular, findings from this study highlight the effectiveness of the Montessori approach across diverse settings and how literacy learning in Montessori classrooms can adapt to different cultural contexts and languages.
BackgroundPhysical inactivity is a major global public health concern and a recognized risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the relationship between physical activity and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in people with T2DM using longitudinal data remains underexplored. We aim to identify the improvement in HRQOL associated with physical activity in Australian middle-aged and older adults using population-based longitudinal data.MethodsData for this study were drawn from waves 9, 13, 17, and 21 of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. We constructed an unbalanced panel consisting of 2,472 person-year observations from 1,270 unique individuals living with T2DM. We used a random effects Generalized Least Squares (GLS) model to examine the relationship between physical activity and HRQOL in people with T2DM.ResultsThe regression results showed that physical activity is positively associated with physical component summary (PCS), mental components summary (MCS), and health state utility value (SF-6D). People with T2DM engaging in physical activity less than once or 1 or 2 times per week had a higher mean score for PCS (β = 4.28, 95% CI: 3.38, 5.17), MCS (β = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.38, 3.34), and SF-6D utility value (β = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.05) than their counterparts engaged in no physical activity. Similarly, engaging in physical activity three times daily per week had a further elevated mean score for PCS (β = 6.65, 95% CI : 5.72, 7.60), MCS (β = 3.75, 95% CI: 2.71, 4.79), and SF-6D utility value (β = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.08).ConclusionOur results showed that physical activity is positively associated with improved HRQOL among people with T2DM. Public health initiatives should prioritize health education and community programs to promote physical activity across all demographics to enhance HRQOL in people living with T2DM.
PurposePhysical functioning and symptom severity are important factors in the experience of people with living with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study evaluates the reliability, validity, and meaningful within-person change (MWPC) thresholds of 2 patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures in NSCLC: the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Physical Function (PF) short form (SF) 8c and the Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (NSCLC-SAQ).MethodsData came from 2 Phase 3 clinical trials among people living with NSCLC. PROMIS PF-SF analyses included data from 300 participants in the PAPILLON trial, and NSCLC-SAQ analyses included 615 participants in the MARIPOSA 2 trial.Prespecified expected relationships between target PRO measures and relevant study variables were used to evaluate validity evidence. Additionally, MWPC thresholds were estimated using anchor- and distribution-based analyses.ResultsBoth PRO measures exhibited adequate internal consistency for clinical trial use. All examined correlations with reference variables and score differences between clinically meaningful groups conformed to expectations for both measures. Estimated thresholds for meaningful worsening were a decrease of 6–7 points on the PROMIS PF-SF and an increase of 2–3 points on NSCLC-SAQ.ConclusionsThis study is the first to examine longitudinal measurement properties of PROMIS PF-SF and investigates thresholds for meaningful change on the PROMIS PF-SF and NSCLC-SAQ measures. Results support the validity of these measures in NSCLC and aid the interpretation of clinically meaningful change in scores over time.
BackgroundTo understand the impact of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) and its treatment on quality of life, we analysed patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) among presumptive ETPB patients.MethodsEuroQol’s five-dimensional three-level (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire and the Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) were used to measure PROMs by 274 presumptive EPTB patients at pre- and post-treatment stages. The patients were categorised as TB and non-TB by using a composite reference standard. Following the EuroQol suggested analysis methods, we calculated the health utility summary measure at the pre- and post-treatment stages. The health state density curve and index were used to analyse inequality in reported health profiles. We investigated factors associated with EPTB patients’ health utility through multivariable regression at the pre-treatment stage.ResultsThe analysis of PROMs showed both physical (mobility, self-care, usual activities) and psychological (pain, discomfort, anxiety & depression) health affected by all EPTB manifestations (lymphadenitis, pleuritis, meningitis and others). Moreover, we found inequality in reported health profiles across disease manifestations at pre- and post-treatment stages. Post-treatment, we found improvement in PROMs and no reports of extreme-level health problems. However, some problems persisted across all dimensions of EPTB manifestations. We found 100% improvement in pleuritis and meningitis manifestations. Socioeconomic status, type of health facility attended, and patients’ working capacity were associated with health utility.ConclusionDespite post-treatment improvement in health, inequality of reported health states by EPTB manifestations persisted, though decreased. This highlights that holistic patient- and health system-level interventions addressing the impact of illness should consider EPTB by its manifestations, not as a single disease entity.
Analog behavior observations are an important component of an evidence-based approach to assessing parent–child interactions. One threat to the external validity of these observations is reactivity and its purported influence on parent and child behaviors. The effects of reactivity on caregiver-child observations are relatively unknown, and to date, there are no known published attempts to document reactivity using a parent report measure. We examined the psychometrics of the Observation Reactivity Questionnaire (ORQ), a 29-item parent report measure of reactivity, operationalized here as a composite including parent report for whether a clinic-based observation represents home behavior (perceived unrepresentativeness), whether a clinic-based observation represents typical parent and child behavior (perceived unrepresentative parent and child behavior), perceived difficulty of the observation task, and perceived discomfort with the observation task. A community sample of 55 parent–child dyads (parents aged 23–56, children aged 2–10) completed a manualized, analog behavior observation prior to completing the ORQ. We investigated psychometric properties of the ORQ quantitative items and compiled qualitative data wherein parents described their reasoning for their responses. Internal consistency of the ORQ was adequate, although discriminative validity evidence was mixed. On average, parents were significantly more likely to report higher levels of reactivity in themselves compared to their children. We concluded that the ORQ shows promise as a new measure of reactivity during observations of parent–child interactions. By quantifying and accounting for reactivity during analog behavior observations, researchers and clinicians can decrease external validity threat concerns in the contexts of research and parent training interventions.
IntroductionAlmost all parents seek online child-related information. This study focuses on parents’ experience of using information from an easy-to-read parenting website,Naître et Grandir(N&G), specifically parents with low socioeconomic status (SES). SES is correlated with health literacy, a major determinant of child education and health. In January 2019, the Information Assessment Method (IAM) questionnaire was improved and implemented in a smartphone application (IAM + N&Gsmart) to reach more low SES parents.ObjectivesWe measured the influence of IAM + N&Gsmart on the frequency with which low SES parents responded to the IAM survey of N&G webpages and the relative proportions of anticipated benefits of the N&G content. We also compared these benefits among fathers and mothers.MethodsThis was a 4-year prospective time series. For each N&G webpage, parents were invited to complete an IAM questionnaire and report anticipated outcomes. IAM data were collected before (2017–2018) and after (2019–2020) the intervention (IAM + N&Gsmart launch) from Quebec parents of 0–8-year-old children who completed at least one IAM questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were applied.ResultsParticipants completed 10,362 IAM questionnaires. Low SES participants anticipated more benefits than other participants, and particularly low SES fathers more than low SES mothers. The proportion of responses and reported benefits from low SES participants increased post-intervention.Conclusions for PracticeResults suggest that increasing literacy-oriented web content can lead to greater benefits among low SES parents, and that increasing father awareness and father-inclusive content can lead to even greater benefits among low SES fathers.
This article seeks to explain the growth of identification and support for the Palestinian cause over the last decades from a regional concern to a global movement. What are the mechanisms that made this possible? This problematic is addressed within a cultural sociological framework, focusing on the cultural work of intellectuals and the collective actions of social movements in articulating and dispersing the idea of a distinctive Palestinian identity and cause. This is a form of cultural nationalism, where claims to nationhood are rooted in the idea of a distinctive, ancient culture. Focus is on the role of intellectuals in the articulation of collective identification and the cultural representations through which it is dispersed. The prime data supported this argument consists of aesthetic representations like novels, films, and photography.
This qualitative case study addresses the need to strengthen the understanding of fathers’ communicative experiences with teachers within Chinese kindergartens from the perspectives of directors, teachers, fathers and their partners. Using Bourdieusian theory, these data were explored to identify fathers’ and teachers’ beliefs and practices that may hinder their communication intended to assist children’s development in the ECE field. Data were gathered through documents provided by kindergartens, fieldnotes (observation data), personal communication (interviews after observation) and semi-structured interviews. The findings indicate that teachers’ gendered perceptions act as a cultural barrier hindering communication between teachers and fathers. Structural barriers include “useless and formalistic information”, “unsatisfactory feedback” and “lack of teacher training on communication”, all of which increase tensions in establishing positive and effective communication between fathers and teachers and reveal the unequal position between fathers and teachers, fathers and mothers. Additionally, fathers felt embarrassed or uncomfortable when communicating with teachers and tended to interrupt teachers less and respect teachers’ views. Further investigations are recommended to examine the impact of more open, timely, individual, and transactional communication targeting fathers.
Recent trends in biblical scholarship that have generated new interest in the book of Psalms and in the voice of lamentation may in turn present new opportunities for the liturgical use of psalms of lament. Drawing on the SIFT approach to biblical hermeneutics, the present study tested the ways in which feeling types and thinking types may evaluate Psalm 74 differently. The data demonstrated that feeling types and thinking types approach a psalm of lament in quite different ways. For thinking types, this is a satisfying intellectual exercise. They are caught up by the theological questions raised and fascinated by the capacity of the human mind to challenge God to keep God’s side of the covenantal agreement with the people. For feeling types, this is a journey of the heart as they identify with the protagonists rehearsing the source and cause of their pain. Preachers and liturgists need to be aware of this contrast.
EU migration policy for labour migrants has a complex history and an unforeseeable future regardless of its high relevance, as it sways between the opposing political positions in favour of and against open borders. By combining normative political theory and policy design analysis, this paper aims at detecting points of reconciliation between cosmopolitan and communitarian approaches to labour migrants’ issues with the aim to contribute to EU migration policy development. A systematic empirical analysis rests on qualitative methodology and is guided by the rules of thematic analysis. Detailed coding of policy goals within diverse EU documents in the last 50 years revealed two models of EU migration policy goals targeting labour migrants: the political and security model and the economic and social model, both encompassing the admission and membership of labour migrants in the host communities. The main findings show that when it comes to third-country nationals, the issue of labour migrants’ entry is approached from a position coherent with communitarianism, while cosmopolitan views are more present at the level of their membership. The research has identified potential areas of reconciliation that should be explored in future policymaking: greater inclusion of labour migrants in decision-making processes; enhancing assistance to third countries; linking more closely the freedom of movement, antidiscrimination, and equality to admission rules; further strengthening of the freedom of religion, particularly for the employment of legally admitted long-term migrants; and building stronger accommodation of domestic cultures to migrants, not only vice versa.
Sexual well-being has long been an area of societal exclusion for disabled people. This exclusion includes control over bodies and relationships, access to representations and public spaces, and autonomy regarding identity choices, lifestyles, and experiences. Innovative and anti-ableist approaches are needed to support sexual well-being among young disabled people. This phenomenological study aimed to explore how social workers can support journeys to achieve sexual well-being from the perspectives of young disabled people. A total of 24 semi-structured interviews were carried out with individuals between the ages of 17 and 24 in Ontario, Canada, who identify themselves as disabled and have had prior interactions with a social worker. The participants had a range of disabilities, including developmental, physical, and mental health. The majority of participants reported having more than one disability. Participants reflected on practice approaches they appreciated when social workers supported them with areas related sexual well-being. More so, they envisioned and recommended various aspects to improve the care and support from social workers. Their suggestions for social workers included increased time and space to develop a therapeutic relationship, unlearning ableism and practicing sex-positivity, accounting for the diverse lived experiences of disabled people, increasing disability representation in social work, and providing and brokering accessible and holistic practice approaches services. This study highlights the importance of holistic and comprehensive social work practice, including sex-positive approaches and multidisciplinary care.
For many children with significant behavioral health needs, the inability to obtain funding for adequate behavioral health care through private means results in parents “voluntarily” placing their child in the state’s child welfare system. This study investigated the association between states’ use of 1915(c) Medicaid waivers for children with behavioral health needs and state rates of voluntary foster care placements. This study used data from the Children’s Bureau Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS), from 2010 to 2019. Multilevel, linear regression models with state-year fixed-effects assessed the relationship between states’ use of a 1915(c) waiver and their total new entry voluntary foster care placement rates for children with behavioral or developmental health care needs, controlling for a variety of state-level policy and demographic characteristics. States’ use of 1915(c) waivers is significantly associated with lower total voluntary placement rates, both in total (β= -1.51 [-2.82, -0.21]) and proportionally (β=-1.03 [-2.07, 0.02]). HCBS Medicaid waivers targeting children with complex behavioral health needs may reduce state rates of voluntary foster care placements.
Research has shown that parental involvement is regarded as a fundamental contributor to children’s school success but there are currently only a few measures available to assess the degree of parental involvement in children’s learning experiences. The Parent and Family Involvement in Education Survey (PFIES) was created to assess parent and family involvement in children’s educational activities and was administered in 2007 as part of the National Household Education Survey (NHES). Although the items from the PFIES were assumed to be meaningful descriptions of parent involvement in children’s educational activities, the utility of these items as a measure of parental involvement was never assessed. This study used items from the PFIES and examined them as a new measure called the Parent Involvement Survey (PIS). Specifically, the study examined the underlying factor structure, the internal consistency, and convergent validity of the emerging measure. The same population of parents were utilized for two samples (n= 315 andn= 316). The results provided support for a 29-item measure with an oblique six-factor solution. The new instrument shows promise as a parsimonious measure for assessing the level of parental involvement in young children’s learning and educational activities. With more accurate information about parental involvement, better management and intervention solutions can be created, which subsequently leads to improved child educational outcomes.
This study reports the prevalence of inpatient, emergency department (ED), and outpatient mental health service usage of children/youth before, during, and after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Rhode Island. Additionally, we identify significant changes in usage across these time periods and the prevalence of each service type contingent upon various demographic profiles. This retrospective observational analysis used Rhode Island Medicaid claims to identify the unique children and youth who used inpatient, ED, and outpatient mental health services across three key time periods: pre-onset (March 2019-February 2020); onset (March 2020-February 2021); and post-onset (March 2021-February 2022). We used z-tests to analyze changes in the proportion of children/youth who accessed these services in each period. We examined relationships between demographic characteristics and time period with chi-square tests. Significant decreases in inpatient and ED usage were identified from pre-onset to onset (p < .05). While inpatient nearly returned to pre-pandemic usage in post-onset, ED usage remained lower. Outpatient usage increased significantly leading up to the pandemic but remained at similar levels between pre-onset and post-onset. From pre-onset to post-onset, females grew as a percentage of all inpatient, ED, and outpatient users. Over this same period, the proportion of inpatient users aged 12–18 increased and the proportion of ED and outpatient users aged 19–24 increased. Female usage of mental health services increased significantly, and older children/youth seemed to drive any significant increases. Future public health and disaster preparedness policies should focus on the unique mental health needs of these socially vulnerable groups.
PurposeThis study utilized a group-based dual-trajectory model to identify distinct dyadic quality of life (QoL) trajectories among young to middle-aged stroke couples and to analyze the predictive factors influencing these trajectories.MethodsA longitudinal study was conducted with 168 young to middle-aged stroke couples. Assessments at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months post-discharge included patients' functional recovery (modified Rankin Scale) and stroke couples' depression, anxiety, stress, benefit finding, social support, couple relationship, and QoL (12-item short-form health scale). Dyadic QoL trajectories were identified using a group-based dual-trajectory model. Stepwise logistic regression was employed to identify the predictors of the trajectory groups.ResultsThree subgroups of dyadic physical QoL trajectories were distinguished: "patients low increase—spouses moderate physical QoL" (15.4%), "patients moderate increase—spouses moderate physical QoL" (74.0%), and "patients moderate increase—spouses high physical QoL" (10.6%). Two subgroups of dyadic mental QoL trajectories were distinguished: "dyadic low increase mental QoL" (15.9%), and "dyadic high increase mental QoL" (84.1%). The trajectory groups were influenced by the patient's sex, functional recovery, depression, and the spouse's mutuality.ConclusionsThe group-based dual-trajectory model facilitates the identification of distinct dyadic QoL trajectories among stroke couples. These findings provide valuable insights for developing targeted interventions aimed at improving their QoL.
ObjectivesIn cancer studies, assessment of patients’ physical function can provide insight into cancer-related symptoms and the side effects of treatment. Physical function can be assessed using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), which may or may not include a recall period—the amount of time the questionnaire asks the respondent to think back to answer the questions. More understanding is needed about how patients interpret and respond to items posed with different recall periods, and which recall period they actually use.Study Design and SettingWe conducted a qualitative study with 72 adults diagnosed with cancer to describe response processes when answering PROM items about physical function.ResultsWhen describing their physical function during concept elicitation interviews, most participants recalled their functioning over 1 month or more. When presented with PROM items with no recall period, the most used period was more than 4 weeks. When presented with a 7-day recall, the most used period was 7 days. However, almost 30% of responses used recall periods greater than 1 week.ConclusionIncluding a 7-day recall period improves recall consistency for patients when answering physical function PROM items, but there is still room for improvement. The inaccuracy of recall for PROMs in clinical trials influences the ability to calculate the change in treatment outcomes over time and may conceal or emphasize actual treatment effects.
One Midwest, non-profit clinic aimed to increase access to contraceptive services by improving their care delivery process through the implementation of a population-specific, contraception education program. The program included patient education, timely follow-up appointments, and free contraception. In this quality improvement project, a total of twenty-two mostly Spanish-speaking women signed up for a group education session that lasted thirty minutes and was offered monthly. The session was led by a female, bilingual provider and focused on contraception benefits, side effects, and common myths. After the session, the clinic offered same-day initiation of contraception for oral contraceptives, Depo-Provera injections, and Nexplanon implants. In this clinic, offering the class in conjunction with immediate initiation of the chosen birth control method decreased the average time to care delivery, showing a positive impact on access to these essential services.
This study examines the spatial and temporal dimensions of the racial difference in depression risk using four waves (1, 3, 4, and 5) of data from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 5977). While previous research has explored the Black–White mental health paradox in the United States, the combined effects of neighborhood contexts and life course trajectories remain underexplored. This study employs linear probability models to assess cumulative effects of neighborhood disadvantage (ND) and coefficient growth-curve analysis to examine age trajectories of depression probability. The findings reveal that greater exposure to ND across the life course (Waves 1–5) are associated with an increased risk of adult depression (Wave 5) for Whites but related to a slightly decreased risk for Blacks. Trajectory analysis demonstrates that residence in disadvantaged neighborhoods increases the probability of depression more rapidly as Whites age compared to Blacks. These results highlight the importance of considering life course perspectives and neighborhood contexts in understanding racial mental health disparities and the racialized embodiment of neighborhood disadvantage.
The development of lobbying regulation in Ireland is often taken as a model of best practice internationally. The well-documented history of corruption in Ireland shows that developing regulations in this area would be a key part of an overall package of reform to increase transparency and ethics in politics. This piece will examine how the Irish legislation came into being, how it operates on a day-to-day basis, the legal and constitutional framework in which it operates, and the gaps that remain in creating a level playing field for all those that seek to communicate on matters of public interest and campaigning. This means that the article will not just be of value to legal scholars in the area but also to the wider disciplines while also developing policy lessons of value for other democracies who are attempting to balance the same issues. Therefore, there are many lessons to be learned from the Irish experience which are of value to other jurisdictions.
Assisting children with homework can be a major stressor in Chinese parents’ lives. Drawing upon the Family Stress Model (FSM), our study examines the indirect effects of parental homework stress on children’s academic functioning, as well as the moderating effect of family socioeconomic status (SES). A pilot study is first conducted to develop and test a parental homework involvement style scale to capture the characteristics of supportive and controlling parental homework involvement in Chinese culture. In the main study, a total of 291 parent-child dyads participated in our survey. The results showed that parental homework stress is linked to negative aspects of children’s academic functioning through the chain mediation of lower levels of coparental support and supportive homework involvement. Multiple group path analysis revealed that, however, in low-income families, parental homework stress undermines children’s academic functioning through both reduced supportive involvement and increased controlling involvement, whereas in high-income families, this impact is channeled solely by the chain mediation of decreased coparental support and supportive involvement. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the parental homework stress process by applying the FSM to the homework context for the first time. It also adds to the homework involvement literature in exploring the potential antecedents of homework involvement styles.
Most work on indicators of vocal confidence (and social influence work more broadly) examines linear relationships between variables. However, in some domains curvilinear (i.e., accelerating or decelerating) relationships may provide greater clarity in understanding human speech patterns. We review mixed past work on vocal speed as a case study, wherein faster vocal speed has been shown both to bolster and inhibit persuasion (e.g., by impairing processing). Across six total studies (Ntotal= 3,958), we show that faster speed initially increases perceived source confidence and message processing but eventually the increase attenuates or reverses. Correspondingly, vocal speed has a decelerating relationship to participants’ processing of persuasive messages, as revealed by two main processes: argument quality effects on attitudes, and the correspondence between thought valence and attitudes. The present work highlights the potential value of high-powered examinations of curvilinear relationships in non-verbal phenomenon for which speed is likely to play a role.
PurposePatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are being used more frequently in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). By utilizing high-quality scales, surgeons can achieve a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of TKA surgery. Currently, there is no widely accepted conceptual model for TKA PROMs. The objective of this study is to fill this gap by developing a conceptual model and preliminary content for a PROM that is specifically designed for TKA patients in mainland China.MethodsThe study design consisted of three stages: (1) a targeted literature review followed by the formation of a conceptual model pool; (2) qualitative data collection involving experts and patients, leading to the development of the preliminary Chinese TKA PROM (CTP); and (3) review of the CTP by experts using the Delphi method, along with cognitive debriefing interviews with patients.Results64 patients and 28 experts took part in this study. The conceptual model focused on six key concepts: pain, symptom, function, quality of life, expectation, and satisfaction. To match the model, the authors developed a total of 35 items.ConclusionA conceptual model and preliminary content for CTP was developed with substantial participation from patients and a multidisciplinary group of experts. The integration of patient and clinical perspectives ensured a comprehensive representation of all relevant disease experiences and the focus of clinical practice. With further refinement through psychometric testing, the CTP is positioned to provide a standardized, comprehensive measure for research specific to Chinese TKA patients.
Community-led routes to welcome refugees and migrants, such as community sponsorship, are often viewed as the devolution of the state’s resettlement and integration responsibilities to non-governmental actors. Yet, there remains a significant role for the state. This paper outlines the role of central, regional, and local government in community-led welcome by drawing from learning from Homes for Ukraine in the UK and the engagement of UK local authorities in the scheme using theories of the multi-level governance of migration. Launched in March 2022 in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Homes for Ukraine allows sponsors to ‘name’ Ukrainians to host in their homes for a minimum of 6 months. While the public and community support for the scheme was unprecedented, our analysis shows the state plays a key role in the scheme. The central government retains overall control of the scheme’s governance by regulating immigration status and the funding parameters for support. Local authorities have specifically defined responsibilities, including checking sponsors’ suitability, wider integration responsibilities, and acting as a ‘backstop’ in case of placement breakdown or beyond the lifetime of the support programme. Ultimately, we suggest that whilst community-led welcome widens the scope of actors involved in resettling and integrating newcomers, it cannot be viewed solely as a community alternative to government-led refugee resettlement and integration. Instead, we propose a conceptualisation of community-led welcome as an approach to resettlement and integration which requires effective multi-level governance for it to offer a durable solution to refugees and newcomers.
Differences in the perceptions of illness between patients and caregivers are associated with negative health-related outcomes. However, little is known about the correlates of divergent perceptions of ADHD among diagnosed adolescents and their parents. This study applied the Common-Sense Model of Illness Representations (CSM) to examine how parent perceptions of ADHD, including divergent parent-adolescent perceptions, relate to coping, quality of life (QoL), and treatment adherence, among adolescents with ADHD. Participants were 63 adolescents diagnosed with ADHD (10–18 years, 79.3% male, mean age = 14.28,SD= 2.07) and their parents (78.8% mothers), recruited from clinics and support services. Self-report measures were completed by adolescents and parents in isolation from one another. Results from a series of hierarchical regressions indicated that adolescents held less pessimistic views of the disorder and believed it was less biologically based than did parents. Divergent parent-adolescent perceptions regardingtimelineandcauseswere significantly related to adolescent coping and QoL. Adolescents’ expectation of a shorter duration of ADHD was associated with reduced active coping. Their stronger attribution to insufficient efforts was associated with lower QoL. Although adolescents with a stronger belief in psychosocial causes exhibited poorer active coping and QoL, they exhibited greater active coping when their parents endorsed this belief. Taken together, these findings identify beneficial and detrimental beliefs about ADHD for both diagnosed adolescents and their parents. The results underscore the potential importance of beliefs about psychosocial causes to coping and well-being, as well as the importance of divergent parent-adolescent perceptions.
This study explores the accelerating shift towards environmentalism in family business as global enterprises increasingly commit to sustainable development goals (SDGs). Specifically, it examines the challenges and capacities within the food and non-alcoholic beverages industry in Kosova, focusing on the integration of clean technology and renewable energy. Utilizing a quantitative approach, the research assesses the financial feasibility for firms to adopt green practices and explores the broader implications for market dynamics. The findings highlight significant opportunities and challenges that family businesses face, particularly in response to growing consumer demand for environmentally friendly products and services. This paper offers new insights into the complexities of corporate sustainability efforts and suggests strategies to enhance environmental responsibility in family business practices. By mapping the current landscape and identifying key barriers and facilitators to sustainable practices, this research contributes valuable perspectives to the ongoing discourse on corporate contributions to environmental sustainability.
This study examines the effect of risk communication styles (fear-based versus empowerment-based) on households’ earthquake preparedness. An online longitudinal study with intervention and control groups was conducted using a representative sample of the adult population in Israel. The change in the reported level of preparedness was assessed through Repeated Measures ANOVA with interaction effects for both the risk communication style and gender. The Analysis revealed a significant difference in reported levels of earthquake preparedness over time (F(1.697,303.70) = 102.58,p< 0.001; partialη2 = 0.36). However, no statistically significant interaction was found with the risk communication style (p= 0.55). Borderline significance (p= 0.04) was observed in the three-way interaction (time-intervention-gender). Gender (β= 0.19), age (β= 0.21), perceived earthquake likelihood (β= 0.14), and sense of preparedness (β= 0.28) were significant predictors in multivariate regression analysis. While consistently showing that participants exposed to empowering information reported higher earthquake preparedness, the research hypothesis was not substantiated. Recommendations for public health policy are discussed.
Early writing is an important early literacy skill related to later reading and writing development. Writing assessment and instruction, however, tends to focus on just part of early writing development, transcription (i.e., handwriting and spelling), whereas composing (i.e., text generation) is an essential component of early and later writing. In fact, several assessments of early writing do not include items that elicit composing and others provide composing items that are too challenging for early writers, yielding floor effects. This study provides evidence for a new approach for eliciting and scoring both transcription and composing from preschool age children. Study 1 provides evidence that within a structured and contextualized assessment in which children compose their own messages, young children can demonstrate transcription skills aligning with the skills they demonstrate on traditional writing assessments (e.g., letter and word writing). Study 2 provides evidence that the structured and contextualized assessment can elicit and score children’s transcription and composing skills such as relevance to the theme, idea generation, genre features, verbal-text match. These two studies provide evidence of item functioning for both transcription and composing items important for research and instructional practice.
Mortality modeling is critical for healthcare policy and resource allocation. Multilayer parameterization and static features are not needed for deep learning (DL) models. To enhance prediction accuracy, DL models like LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU have shown promise. However, research on using DL models to mortality modeling remains restricted. Hence, this paper presents a unique technique that blends DL models with a Hotelling\(T^2\)control chart. The DL models anticipate the number of fatalities, while the Hotelling\(T^2\)control chart examines the abnormalities. Furthermore, MTY decomposition is employed for diagnostic analysis of age groups in the population. Using the Great Britain mortality dataset, a comparison study is developed between the Hotelling\(T^2\)control chart based on traditional mortality and the DL models. The data demonstrated that the suggested strategy outperformed the current methods. Moreover, this study illustrates the methodology’s potential for identifying mortality variations owing to emerging diseases.
This paper is the first ethnographic study focusing on Asian American women’s experiences in electoral politics. It has three important contributions to the literature on Asian Americans’ panethnicity and political engagement. First, I illuminate the specific gendered and racialized position Asian American women occupy in the US formal political process today. I argue that, despite the ethnic differences or their long tenure in politics, the sexism within their panethnic or ethnic communities combined with racism from the non-Asian populations lead to their “doubly marginalized” position in politics. Second, I highlight the different stereotypes of East/Southeast Asian women and South Asian women operating in politics, offering a nuanced analysis of the racism targeting various Asian ethnicities, particularly those of women. Last, I expand the literature on panethnicity by demonstrating the emergence of a “gendered” Asian American panethnicity among Asian American women, which is less frequently discussed in the literature. Despite coming from different ethnic backgrounds, the similar experiences of sexism and racism among Asian American women enable their specific gendered panethnic solidarity, leading to their support of other Asian American women in politics.
This paper investigates households’ financial fragility in twelve European countries to assess whether international differences are a matter of household characteristics and/or of country features. Financial fragility is characterized by not having income constraints, but by holding insufficient liquid assets to face unexpected expenses. The estimation results show that this metric is able to capture difficulties other than those related to debt and income and highlight the relevance of accounting for household portfolio decisions. Specifically, an illiquid portfolio increases the likelihood of financial fragility, while indebtedness not always does. Relevant differences among countries are observed in terms of both the estimated average likelihood of financial fragility and its main determinants. A decomposition exercise carried out by means of counterfactual methods shows that most of each country’s difference in financial fragility with respect to Germany arises predominantly from household characteristics rather than from its economic-institutional setup, even if in two countries the latter is found to more than compensate for the former.
Contemporary research on older Latin American immigrants emphasises their health issues and mental problems. Most lived experience research has been done in North America and Europe, with relatively few studies in Australia, creating a gap that needs to be addressed. As part of a broad Constructivist Grounded Theory study, the aim of this study was to explore and derive insights from the lived migration experiences of older Latin American immigrants in Australia. Twenty-three Spanish-speaking immigrants aged 60 and above were interviewed. Data analysis was conducted concurrently with data collection using a constant comparative method. Ethical approval was obtained before commencing data collection. The study’s core category was “Preserving culture and values after migration”. This highlights the significance of cultural identity for older Latin American immigrants in Australia, as they prioritise promoting and preserving their traditions to foster a sense of solidarity, helping them enhance their mental health. Language experiences were vital in cultural conservation and integration into the host society. The migration experiences of older Latin American immigrants in Australia involve various aspects, including cultural preservation, identity maintenance, and integration challenges. Recognising and respecting their cultural background, values, traditions, and language within Australia’s multicultural society is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of services and promoting their mental health and integration within the community.
This essay explores possible meanings hidden in the 1928 bronze statueSinnataggen—The Angry Boy—by the Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland. The toddler, exuding anger and frustration, is a beloved statue. What is his attraction? Why is the boy angry, and what does he seek to communicate? The essay argues there is an Angry Boy in every boy and man, an emotion prohibited by contemporary American culture and especially for men of color. Anger, a response to one’s environment, is central to feeling alive and feeling real. Through a circumscribed conversation between Vigeland,The Angry Boy, and psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott, the author argues thatThe Angry Boyrepresents core experiences of the complex male self. Contemporary boys and men have a conversation partner in Vigeland’s iconic statue.
We investigate the effects that different levels of transparency may have on a simple nudge. Using an incentivized task and eliminating possible confounds due to strategic reasoning, we examine how different types of information (positive, negative, or a combination of the two) affect the impact of a nudge on behaviour in an experimental task. Our results indicate that providing reasons in favour of the nudge increases its efficacy, while warning subjects about its potential drawbacks does not significantly reduce it.
This qualitative study explores the perceptions and experiences of college students, faculty, and administrators on mental well-being pre-and-post COVID-19 pandemic. The study used an exploratory sequential design, and this manuscript presented findings from the qualitative (phase one) data collected through in-depth interviews with students, faculty, and administrators (N= 20). Interviews were conducted in person and virtually, audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. An inductive thematic analysis was undertaken using a comprehensive codebook and Nvivo14 software. The findings revealed three major categories of views and experiences based on the timeframes around COVID-19 and campus closure: (a) pre-pandemic, (b) during the pandemic, and (c) post-pandemic (after the reopening of campus). Views on pre-pandemic demonstrated that in-person learning is better for mental well-being, having a structure reduces stress, and the real college experience positively impacts mental well-being. The pandemic period was characterized as overwhelming and stressful, complex, and mixed spaces of work and life, dominated by feelings of isolation, lack of motivation, and anxiety. The post-pandemic period was filled with mixed feelings of excitement and the burden of readjustment. The re-opening of campus did not mean coming back to the pre-pandemic state; feelings of anxiety and trauma from the pandemic days continued. The period was marked by declined support that created a mental burden, but also important lessons were learned on how to maintain mental well-being. As colleges navigate the post-pandemic landscape, it is imperative to maintain a focus on mental wellness, integrating preventive measures, crisis response strategies, and continuous evaluation of mental health services.
This special issue on “The Different Faces of Corruption and Organised Crime in Sport”, aims to shed light on the multifaceted nature of criminal activities that have infiltrated sport at all levels—from grassroots competitions to elite professional leagues. At the same time, specific attention is paid to the role of endogenous actors, threatening the integrity of and in sport from within the sport ecosystem. Hence, this special issue criticises and expands the dominant narrative that sport is a pristine industry that is merely jeopardised by external, ‘mafia type’ actors. Showing that the scope of organised crime in sport is diverse and complex, reflecting the evolving tactics of criminal organisations as they adapt to new regulatory landscapes, technological advances, and shifting market dynamics, this special issue pushes the envelope in grasping that sport and corruption are more intertwined than openly admitted in both academia and practice.
This cautionary article urges general education preschool teachers to evaluate their responses to challenging student behavior. The manuscript delivers practical advice to improve teachers' responses to challenging behavior by refreshing their understanding of the various consequences that influence behavior recurrence. It highlights the need to avoid punitive measures that could harm teacher–child relationships and instead offer non-generic and function-specific consequences that support the child's needs and promote positive behavior development. By providing a review of the different types of consequences and real-life examples to illustrate their use, the article encourages teachers to consider the consequences they give, especially when a child's behavior changes in an unexpected direction.
As globalization and neoliberalism drive increased international migration, the need for counseling and pastoral care for culturally diverse migrants is expanding. This study analyzes counseling experiences with a Korean Mongolian multicultural family using a case study methodology, exploring how intercultural interventions manifest in the counseling process. The findings reveal that intercultural approaches facilitate not only problem resolution but also mutual transformation. The researcher focused on exploring the client’s personal, social, and cultural needs through cultural assessment and pastoral theological reflection, emphasizing practical intercultural interventions. This study proposes a pastoral circle method for intercultural intervention, outlining four stages: reflection, revelation, response, and restoration. Future research should further examine the applicability and effectiveness of intercultural counseling with migrants from diverse cultural backgrounds.
Existing literature suggests that public health insurance expansion improves multiple indirect indicators of financial well-being (e.g., credit score, bankruptcy, debt sent to third-party collection agencies, and payday borrowing) of the newly eligible individuals in the United States. However, there is a lack of understanding of the association between these expansions and how the newly eligible individuals directly evaluate different aspects of their financial well-being in the post-expansion years. To address the gap, I use data from the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, and 2021 waves and employ difference-in-differences and event study designs utilizing temporal and spatial variations in the expansion of Medicaid—a major public health insurance program in the country—under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. As outcome variables, I use three indicators of financial well-being directly evaluated by the respondents in multiple waves of the NFCS: perceived financial difficulty, perceived over-indebtedness, and financial satisfaction. The findings suggest a link between 2014 Medicaid expansions and a reduction in perceived financial difficulty and over-indebtedness in 2021—the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, findings also suggest that these expansions were not associated with financial satisfaction among the newly eligible in any of the post-expansion years. Overall, these findings indicate that although public health insurance expansion improves some aspects of financial well-being, it does not appear to change how the newly eligible individuals make an overall evaluation of their finances.
In October 2020, the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S. introduced “Title 42” as an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19 by halting almost all forms of immigration. This policy is a clear illustration of the link between immigration and perceived disease contagion, and the association is not new. There is, in fact, a longstanding literature on the relationship between “contagion threat” and attitudes towards immigration. How might these attitudes shift in light of the COVID-19 pandemic? This study uses a two-wave panel survey of immigration attitudes (Wave 1 in October 2019 before COVID-19 and Wave 2 in April 2020 during lockdowns in the US) and finds some important shifts in attitudes. We find no evidence that underlying support for immigration was changed by the pandemic. That said, Democrats worried about the threat of COVID-19 increasingly supported lower levels of immigration, and Republicans worried about the threat of COVID-19 were more likely to support financial relief for immigrants. The pandemic is thus a timely illustration of the connection between immigration and contagion threat.
All parents want to bring up their children in the best way possible, and they are naturally interested in exploring and borrowing good parenting practices from other families and cultures. With parents’ increased international exposure, intercultural referencing of parenting practices is on the rise. Reported in this study is an autoethnographic exploration of two Chinese Canadian parents in their efforts to understand and apply the best parenting practices from both Chinese and Canadian cultures. The study breaks the limitations of existing constructs of authoritarian parenting vs indulgent parenting to describe Eastern and Western parenting styles. It highlights the importance of balance and hybridity of parenting styles in order to get the best of both worlds. It also highlights the importance of examining deeper social, economic, and demographic factors in the larger national contexts to understand observable parenting behaviors.
The aim of this article is to investigate the impact of Aberdeen Football Club’s proposed relocation from Pittodrie Stadium to the environs of Westhill, almost seven miles west of the city-centre, and to assess the probability of acceptance amongst stakeholders of the football club. At the present time, writing in November 2024, it appears that the club has abandoned this plan. Instead, there is talk of a new stadium on the seafront not far from Pittodrie. However, the issues and stakeholder relationships revealed through this case remain worthy of extensive study for what they reveal about the intersection between the corporate world, the community organizations, and the hardcore supporter bases; and how each works according to a different logic and rhythm as they vie for power and ascendency. During the fieldwork, conducted in 2018-20, the opinions of shoppers in both Aberdeen and Westhill were canvassed, alongside the views of supporters from one of the popular Aberdeen FC supporters’ clubs.
Mental disorders are a global health issue affecting millions of individuals. People with mental disorders often face barriers to treatment, including stigma and discrimination, social, religious, and familial barriers, and a lack of knowledge about available treatment options. These barriers can lead to delayed or untreated mental illnesses, with serious consequences for the individuals, their families, and communities. This cross-sectional study explores the treatment barriers for different mental disorders as they significantly impact people’s lives. It includes patients diagnosed with mental disorders. The data were collected from the patients or their companions attending Qassim Mental Health Hospital’s outpatient clinic. We used a self-administered online questionnaire, sociodemographic variables, and the barrier to access to care evaluation (BACE) scale. Our sample included 332 adult patients with mental disorders (men, 63.9%; women, 36.1%). The mean percentage scores for stigma-, attitude-, and instrument-related barriers were 26.7%, 33.0%, and 18.7%, respectively. Younger age was associated with higher scores in all three BACE domains. Patients with psychotic disorders faced stigma- and attitude-related barriers, but not instrument-related barriers. Patients with multiple mental conditions faced increased stigma- and instrument-related barriers but not attitude-related barriers. Further longitudinal studies are required to better understand these barriers to help patients with mental conditions.
PurposeEvidence of comprehensibility is frequently required during the development of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs); the respondent’s interpretation of PROM items needs to align with intended meanings. Cognitive interviews are recommended for investigating PROM comprehensibility, yet guidance for analysis is lacking. Consequently, the quality and trustworthiness of cognitive interview data and analysis is threatened, as there is no clear procedure detailing how analysts can systematically, and consistently, identify evidence that respondent interpretations align/misalign with intended meanings.MethodsThis paper presents a novel, structured approach to comprehensibility analysis - the ‘Comprehensibility Continuum’ – that builds upon existing cognitive interview guidance.ResultsThe Comprehensibility Continuum comprises a structured rating scale to code depth of alignment between intended item meaning and respondent interpretation and consists of five main stages: before cognitive interviews are conducted, researchers must (1) Define intended meanings of PROM items; and (2) Determine comprehensibility thresholds for both participant- and item-level. After conducting interviews, they (3) Prepare data by transcribing interviews ‘intelligent’ verbatim; (4) Code transcripts using the Comprehensibility Continuum scale in iterative sets, assigning an overall code for each item at participant-level; and (5) Compare participant-level codes across all participants to determine overall item comprehensibility, such that decisions can be made to retain, modify, or remove items.ConclusionQuality in qualitative data analysis is achieved through rigorous methods that are clearly described and justified. Given insufficiency in guidelines, cognitive interviewers must reflect on how best to demonstrate PROM comprehensibility systematically and consistently from interview data, and the Comprehensibility Continuum method offers a potential solution.
This research delves into the dynamics of 5–6-year-old children’s interactions within makerspaces, which are emerging as innovative environments in early childhood education. Despite their growing popularity, there is a notable absence of research evaluating the activities in these spaces for young learners. To address this gap, we conducted a comparative case study, observing three kindergarten classrooms. Qualitative data, gathered through observations, questionnaires, and interviews, provided insights into the children’s makerspace experiences and the social processes in which they engage. The findings yielded two major themes. Firstly, some children, often marginalized in other classroom settings, assumed leadership roles within makerspaces, highlighting their unique knowledge and potential for leadership development. Secondly, gender differences emerged, with boys engaging in mimetic activities influenced by male role models, and girls pursuing goal-oriented approaches. These differences reflect the interplay between gender roles, societal influences, and early childhood learning in makerspaces. We conclude that makerspaces serve as powerful environments in nurturing both resilience and creativity among young learners. This research provides educators with a deeper understanding of how to harness the potential of makerspaces for promoting leadership, achieving gender equity, and unraveling pivotal social interactions—all vital components of contemporary education.
Race-related data are not routinely collected as part of the Canadian kindergarten teacher reported Early Development Instrument (EDI) data collection even though they could be used to inform provision of supports for students and educators. Therefore, the goal of our exploratory study was to gather an understanding of teacher perceptions regarding the assessment of items on the EDI in the context of children’s race, gender, and family status and teacher positionality. We conducted a series of four focus groups with educators (kindergarten teachers and designated early childhood educators) from a school board in Ontario, Canada. The major themes identified were: (1) intersections of social identity; (2) systemic biases and preconceived expectations; (3) educator reflections on feelings, attitudes, and circumstances; (4) teacher-child-family relationships; and (5) teacher training, education, and administrative resources. Our findings suggest that educators’ assessment may be influenced and informed by their perception of their own and their students’ identity. Potential of a bias might be reduced by adequate training and education.
Little research explores how climate extremes affect early childhood mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, despite great vulnerability to both climate extremes and high rates of early childhood mortality. Although there have been substantial improvements in early childhood mortality in recent decades, climate change threatens to offset this progress. Focusing on the case of Côte d’Ivoire, I combine individual-level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys with high-resolution climate data to investigate how and when in-utero exposure to severe agricultural droughts influences early childhood mortality. I find that in-utero exposure to severe agricultural droughts increases the probability of under-five mortality, and most recent droughts seem to exert the greatest impact. I also find that boys and children born into families with little to no formal education are highly vulnerable to drought exposure during gestation. Maternal education mitigates the negative impact of droughts on under-five survival, regardless of urban or rural residence, suggesting that its protective effects may be linked to specific knowledge, behaviours, and practices that highly educated mothers employ rather than their living environment. These findings carry important lessons for policymakers, emphasising the need for policies that enhance educational opportunities for parents and develop targeted interventions for boys and children from families with little formal education.
Evidence of gender differences in parental burnout has been replicated in several studies and in several cultures, showing a higher level of parental burnout in mothers but a greater sensitivity of fathers to this serious condition. However, the reasons for these differences have never been tested empirically. In this study, we tested whether mothers’ higher level of burnout is related to their greater investment in parenting activities. We also tested the greater sensitivity of fathers to a stress factor that is highly associated with parental burnout, emotion regulation. 1,322 Brazilian parents (41.3% fathers) participated in the study during the pandemic, which was regarded as a context in which parental stress naturally increased. The results confirmed mothers’ higher mean level of parental burnout. Contrary to our expectations, the results also revealed that mothers still experienced higher parental burnout than fathers even when we strictly controlled for the level of involvement in parenting. They also showed that compared to fathers, mothers were more susceptible to emotion dysregulation and to a stressful situation affecting parenting (i.e. the pandemic). Avenues for future studies are twofold. First, they should investigate alternative explanations for gender differences in parental burnout. Second, to the extent that gender moderates the impact of risk factors on parental burnout, future studies should identify specific risk factors for mothers on the one hand and for fathers on the other.
With the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, undocumented crime victims could legalize their status in the United States by obtaining either a T or a U non-immigrant visa. In essence, both visas provide immigration relief from deportation to foreign-born victims along with other legal protections. Although every year a total of 5000 T-visas and 10,000 U-visas are made available to qualifying crime victims, very little is known about their attainability, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the goal of this paper is (1) to examine the number of T- and U-visa applications received, approved, and denied from 2008 to 2022; (2) to identify any potential barriers to the T- and U-visa process that might explain changes in issuance rates over time; and (3) to discuss implications for policy and practice as well as future research directions. Although both visas have seen a decline in application numbers at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, USCIS data suggests that T- and U-visa applicants might be experiencing different visa processing issues. Implications for improving the visa application process include changes to the current eligibility requirements, improved victim identification efforts, and establishing a new framework for immigration policymaking.
ObjectiveExisting research has shown that parental exposure to violence has negative consequences on health outcomes, but the effect of such exposure on unmet health care and social service need is unknown. This study aims to investigate the association between unmet health care and social services and parental violence exposure among parents with children.Study DesignThis study used the data of 6289 parents aged 18–60 years who had at least one child under 18 years living in the same household. Parental violence exposure was measured. Unmet child and adult health care and social service need was operationalized through questions on the services needed, those that had not been received, and those that were considered inadequate.ResultsParents who experienced any kind of violence had more unmet service need. There were more women among parents with violence experience (65.4%) than those with no violence experience (51.9%). Violence experience increased the odds of unmet need for general adult healthcare services (OR 2.02, CI 1.64–2.57), maternity and child health clinics (OR 2.52, CI 2.00–3.18), family guidance clinics and home help (OR 2.38, CI 1.60–3.54), mental health or child welfare services (OR 2.05, CI 1.52–2.75), and school health care (OR 1.99, 1.50–2.65). After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, the associations between exposure to violence experience and unmet needs for healthcare and social services remained statistically significant.ConclusionViolence in close relationships profoundly impacts health and well-being. By addressing unmet health care needs and supporting parents, we can break the cycle of violence and promote better mental health outcomes. Preventive policies and early interventions are essential to mitigate the consequences of violence in families.
This article provides an overview of the development of chaplaincy and spiritual care in the Canadian province of Ontario in the last 50 years. Four spheres or areas in this development are described: (1) faith group pastoral/spiritual care, (2) armed forces chaplaincy, (3) spiritual care practitioners and psychospiritual therapists certified by the Canadian Association of Spiritual Care/Association canadienne de soins spirituels, and (4) specialized spiritual care. These four spheres overlap and influence each other. Some members in each sphere are registered psychotherapists in the College of Registered Psychotherapists in Ontario. These changes are interpreted through the evolutionary theology of Teilhard de Chardin.
Early College High Schools (ECs) aim to increase postsecondary enrollment and degree attainment, specifically among historically minoritized populations. Research outlines the positive outcomes of ECs, yet less research examines the unintended consequences of these consolidated college preparation programs. Through interviews with 13 EC graduates, this qualitative study investigated the social and cultural sacrifices made in exchange for program participation. Using Cultural Reproduction Theory, this study examines the role ECs play in maintaining social hierarchies and perpetuating dominant cultural values. Findings reveal students’ reflections on the costs and long-term impacts of their EC experience. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.
Against the background of increased labor market flexibilization, health issues amongst employees have become a pressing social concern in Korea. Yet, little is known about the diversity in employment experiences and the associated health implications amongst employees. To accurately gauge labor market segmentation, whilst simultaneously accounting for health-risk factors, we employ the multidimensional Employment Quality (EQ) concept in a typological manner. This method differentiates various employment segments, with the Standard Employment Relationship (SER) serving as a benchmark. Using the 2017 Korean Working Conditions Survey (KWCS), we employ Latent Class Cluster Analysis on a sample of the salaried workforce (N = 25.376) to construct a typology of EQ. Via logistic regression, we link the EQ typology to poor mental well-being and poor self-rated general health. As a result, we find six distinct types of EQ arrangements in Korea: SER-like, Instrumental, SER Intensive, Instrumental Intensive, Precarious Intensive, and Precarious Unsustainable. We find that deviations from the SER-like segment are associated with poorer health and well-being outcomes, even when accounting for confounding factors, with precarious EQ segments showing the most pronounced adverse health and well-being associations. This study furthers our understandings of health disparities within the salaried workforce. Our findings underscore the need for targeted reforms of workplace- and employment-related health policies to foster a healthier working population in Korea.
The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) people in Canada. Despite higher SARS-CoV-2 exposure risks, likelihood of being quarantined, and risk of severe disease outcomes, little is known about the pandemic’s effects on this community’s mental health. This study aims to identify factors associated with changes in ACB Canadians’ mental health during the pandemic and provide guidance for improved access to mental health resources. Data was collected from May to July 2021 using a cross-sectional, national, online survey. Eligible participants for this community-based study were ACB adults residing in Canada. Survey measures included demographics, pandemic-related experiences, mental health status, and access to mental health services. Bivariate analyses and multinomial logistic regression examined associations between variables. Among the 1,556 participants, 25.4% reported improved mental health and 33.1% reported worsened mental health since the pandemic’s onset. Improved mental health was associated with younger age, receiving at least one pandemic-related benefit, and living in a home that became safer. In contrast, worsened mental health was associated with younger age, working less, the pandemic having a major impact on ability to pay bills, not receiving pandemic-related benefits, home becoming less safe, and increased substance use. Barriers to accessing mental health services included difficulty getting an appointment, cost, pandemic measures, and lack of culturally competent care. These insights underscore the positive impact of pandemic-related emergency relief, the challenges in accessing mental health services, and the gaps in culturally competent mental health care.
Researchers have extensively investigated parents’ psychological control over children. However, there is a lack of research examining parent psychological control during adulthood and its underlying mechanisms, particularly in the context of intergenerational co-parenting. The present study aimed to fill this gap by exploring the potential mediating roles of multidimensional intergenerational co-parenting relationships and insomnia severity in the association between grandparents’ psychological control and parents’ depressive symptoms. Data were collected from intergenerational co-parenting families in urban Tianjin and Shanghai, China (N= 674). Serial mediation models were used to allow for two mediators simultaneously. Path analyses were performed to investigate the mediation models of the total score and each sub-construct of intergenerational co-parenting relationships, respectively. The results showed that in the context of intergenerational co-parenting, grandparent psychological control was positively associated with parents’ depressive symptoms. Intergenerational co-parenting relationships and parents’ insomnia severity alone mediated the association between grandparents’ psychological control and parents’ depressive symptoms, respectively. Moreover, among the multiple dimensions of intergenerational co-parenting relationships, only the dimension of exposure of child to conflict via insomnia severity mediated such an association. Family service practitioners or therapists working with intergenerational co-parenting families should pay attention to parents with high levels of grandparent psychological control and focus on enhancing parent-grandparent co-parenting relationships, particularly reducing parent-grandparent conflict exposure to children. Additionally, addressing parents’ sleep problems might be a key component of interventions aimed at improving the psychological well-being of parents experiencing psychological control from co-parenting grandparents.
Xenophobia among healthcare professionals can significantly impact the quality of care provided to immigrant and refugee populations, particularly in countries with high influxes such as Türkiye. This study evaluated xenophobia among resident physicians at Pamukkale University Hospital and identified factors influencing these attitudes. This cross-sectional study involving 271 resident physicians at Pamukkale University Hospital was conducted between August 1 and August 20, 2022. The participants were randomly selected and stratified by department. Data were collected via a 38-item questionnaire, including the 11-item Xenophobia Scale. Descriptive statistics, the Mann‒Whitney U test, the Kruskal‒Wallis test, and multiple linear regression analysis were used for data analysis. The mean xenophobia scale score among participants was 57.53 (SD = 7.82), indicating high levels of xenophobic attitudes. The significant factors associated with higher xenophobia scores included being from a surgical department (B = 0.571,p< 0.001) and lacking foreign nationals in their close environment (B = 0.724,p< 0.001). Additionally, 58.7% of the resident physicians opposed providing free healthcare services to refugees, and 10.0% indicated that they might delay providing health services to these patients because of their status. Additionally, 7.7% of the resident physicians admitted to discriminating against migrant/refugee patients. The study reveals pervasive xenophobic attitudes among resident physicians in Türkiye, which are influenced by departmental affiliation and the social environment. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to address xenophobia in healthcare settings, including cultural competence training and policy changes, to ensure equitable healthcare access for all patients.
The experience of joy and shared joyful moments benefits children’s learning, development and wellbeing. The arts engage the senses, imagination and creativity in meaning making and expression of ideas. Learning through the arts is often collaborative and embodied. This paper reports on a study which explored the use of arts-based practices in teaching writing with children mostly aged seven to nine years. Teachers intentionally adopted arts-based practices to reconnect with active, embodied and creative ways of exploring content and connect multiple ways of meaning making for children. This research affirmed that children benefitted from intentionally adopting arts-based practices to help facilitate student’s writing.
This paper investigates the relationship between refugee children’s social integration and foreign language difficulty. It also examines how different legal settlements and their accompanying education paradigms impact refugee students’ integration and language difficulties in Lebanon and Australia, where short- and long-term legal settlements are provided. The study is based on a longitudinal survey data collected between the academic years 2018 and 2021, with 1565 observations. Our findings reveal that refugees who felt more welcome in the host country were less likely to have high language difficulties. Conversely, refugees who faced high language difficulties were less likely to feel welcome in the host country. Despite the aforementioned, refugees in Lebanon felt less welcomed in their host country, even though they faced lower language difficulties. Therefore, our study reveals that the successful integration of refugee students in the host country requires comprehensive efforts at various levels. This comprehensive approach includes creating inclusive educational environments and equitable policies that promote a sense of belonging while also addressing language comprehension challenges among refugee students.
Given that social and emotional learning (SEL) is critical for children’s current development and future success, effective teaching can enhance this process. This qualitative study investigatedwhichcompetencies were prioritized most frequently in social and emotional teaching (SET),why, andhow. Data collection included: (1) observations of three preschool teachers’ SET in their interactions with children over six days during typically occurring indoor and outdoor activities at a Reggio-inspired childcare center in the United States; and (2) individual interviews with these teachers. The research team coded 75 critical instances of SET for evidence of CASEL’s five social and emotional competencies (Self-Awareness,Self-Management,Social Awareness,Relationship Skills, andResponsible Decision-Making). Additionally, these instances were analyzed according to (Ng and Bull, International Journal of Early Childhood 50:335–352, 2018) four teaching strategies (setting a positive tone,suggestion of solutions,task allocation, andextension). The findings reveal that the teachers: (1) intentionally modeled and taughtRelationship Skillsmost frequently; (2) demonstrated the congruence between beliefs about SEL and practices of SET, especially in relationship skills as promoted in a Reggio-inspired context, and (3) applied an integrated approach to SET by setting a positive tone in all activities, with the most frequent instances occurring during circle time, followed by center/play time, and then mealtime.
This study documents changes in consumption inequality in Ghana from 2005 to 2017. The focus is on the causal link from consumption inequality to household multidimensional poverty. We use three rounds of the Ghana Living Standards Survey, augmented with district level administrative data. Consumption inequality is measured using the Gini coefficient at the district level while multidimensional poverty is measured using the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative's index. The control function approach is employed to estimate the effect of consumption inequality on multidimensional poverty. The findings show an upward trend in consumption inequality at the national level between 2005 and 2017, which is consistent with the inequality trends for the Savannah and Forest ecological zones but not with the trends for the Coastal zone. The main result of the regression analysis is that inequality increases multidimensional poverty, a finding that is robust to alternative measures of inequality and poverty. Further, the association between inequality and poverty is more pronounced in rural areas and amongst male headed households. Neighbourhood unrest is an important channel through which inequality operates to increase multidimensional poverty. We suggest policies that the government can use to reduce both poverty and inequality in Ghana.
The purpose of this study was to examine which early childhood (EC) teachers’ qualifications (i.e., degree, major, and teaching experience) are linked to teachers’ Metacognitive Awareness (MA) and science teaching efficacy, and to investigate the relation among EC teachers’ MA components and science teaching efficacy. A total of 153 Head Start teachers from eight U.S. states completed validated surveys that measured their science teaching efficacy and MA. Results from multilevel ANOVA and regression analysis showed that teachers with an early childhood education background were more positive about their ability to teach science, more mindful of their teaching strategies, and more likely to self-evaluate their teaching as compared to teachers without an EC education background. Also, teachers who were more aware of their teaching strategies and instructional goals, and monitored their teaching practices reported higher confidence in their ability to teach science. Our results revealed the role of MA in early science teaching efficacy and highlighted the importance of supporting EC teachers’ professional development, particularly for those whose backgrounds are not in EC.
An improved global estimate of the amount of trafficking in human beings/modern slavery is produced. The paper develops the methodology for data to populate Indicator 16.2.2 in the UN SDGs, ‘the estimated number of victims of human trafficking per 100,000 population, by sex, age, and form of exploitation’. The improved estimate is constructed by integrating data from the International Labour Organization/Walk Free/International Organization for Migration (ILO/Walk Free/IOM) with administrative data from United Nations Organization on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) rather than from the Counter Trafficking Global Data Collaborative (CTDC). The data from the UNODC is more comprehensive and less volatile than that from the CTDC on registered victims of trafficking. The new estimate is more than 30% larger, increases the proportion of trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation from 27 to 56%, and increases the proportion of victims of trafficking who are female from 54 to 64%. This has implications for the priorities for social and public policy for prevention and for the provision of services to mitigate harms.
This study aims to investigate various forms of online engagement in relation to feelings of loneliness among older men and women during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored which types of online engagement were associated with loneliness among older adults, with special attention to potential gender differences. We analyzed data from the 2020 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), including 4,421 respondents aged 50 or older (1,732 men and 2,689 women). Loneliness was measured using the 11-item UCLA Loneliness Scale. Ordinary Least Squares Regression models were estimated to assess the relationship between different types of online engagement and loneliness. More frequent use of all examined online engagement types, including instant messaging, social network sites, other social media, chat apps, and video chat, was associated with lower loneliness levels. Video chat had the strongest association with reduced loneliness, while social network sites had the weakest. Older men tended to report higher levels of loneliness compared to older women during the pandemic. Older women generally reported higher levels of online engagement than older men, although this pattern varied across different online platforms. No gender differences were found in the associations between online engagement and loneliness. This study highlights the potential positive role of online engagement in mitigating loneliness among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings emphasize the importance of developing policies that encourage and support internet access and online engagement initiatives for older adults to combat loneliness.
PurposeSymptomatic uterine fibroids are difficult to live with because affected women experience many clinical manifestations that can impact their quality of life. The purpose of the current study was to explore the quality of life in women with uterine fibroids.MethodsThis qualitative study was conducted on a purposive sample of women with uterine fibroids, using conventional content analysis based on Granheim and Lundman’s approach. The steps included transcribing verbatim immediately after conducting each interview, reading the entire text to obtain an overall concept, identifying semantic units, coding, classifying similar codes into more comprehensive subcategories and categories, and extracting the main themes. Data were collected through semi-structured, in-depth individual interviews with 15 patients with uterine fibroids who were referred to the health centers and a teaching hospital of Zanjan, Iran, from September 2022 to July 2023. The data collection was continued until data saturation.ResultsTwenty-five eligible patients were invited to participate in the study, and 15 of them accepted, resulting in an agreement rate of 60%. While women expressed devastating experiences due to the disease, they also indicated some positive elements in their day-to-day living. Overall, four themes emerged from the data analysis as follows: health challenges, determination for an optimal lifestyle, perceived social support, and religious practice.ConclusionThe impact of uterine fibroids on quality of life is complex, extending beyond physical, psychological, and social effects. In addition to these known dimensions, spirituality and perceived support are also crucial. Addressing these dimensions is essential for improving quality of life of women with uterine fibroids.
The prevalence of falls in older individuals worldwide is around 26.5%. There is an urgent need to identify factors antagonistic to advanced age-related falls regarding personal safety, family or nursing care time, and healthcare costs. The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between functional fitness, mental health indicators, and the risk of falling (ROF) in older adults. Thirty-eight older adults (60–94 years; 66% female) were tested individually with the Fullerton Functional Fitness Test (FFFT) after completing five instruments gauging resilience, well-being, satisfaction with life, happiness, and perceived stress. We measured the ROF with the Berg Balance Test. All objective and subjective measures correlated significantly with the ROF. Bayesian linear regressions revealed that complex movement coordination accounted for 68.8%, while resilience accounted for 48.5% of the variance in the ROF. Moreover, resilience was also a mediator between complex movement coordination and ROF. These results suggest that complex movement coordination-developing and resilience-enhancing training strategies might be beneficial in reducing the ROF in older adults.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, China implemented the “zero COVID-19” policy (enforcing mass testing, quarantine, lockdowns, etc.) for about three years to minimize infections. However, the longitudinal evidence on the mental health impact of COVID-19 containment policies in the Chinese context is limited. Drawing on six waves of national panel data covering the period of early 2020–late 2022, this study uses fixed-effects models to examine the relationship between the stringency of COVID-19 containment policies and individuals’ depressive symptoms, and the extent to which this impact was mediated by psychosocial, economic, and health factors. The results show that individuals’ depressive symptoms increased as COVID-19 containment policies became more stringent, and this held even after the COVID-19 incidence rate and other time-varying controls were accounted for. Individuals’ locus of control, unemployment, and their or their household members’ COVID-19 infection mediated more than half of the relationship between COVID-19 containment policies and depressive symptoms. Locus of control was the most prominent mediator, followed by unemployment, while COVID-19 infection played a marginal mediating role.
This qualitative case study explores the affordances of home-based multimodal literacy activities through the case of Mason’s (pseudonym) home writing experiences, a six-year-old bilingual kindergartener. Utilizing a play-based family literacy framework, the study examines 15 handmade mini-books created by Mason, revealing three key themes: (1) agency, creativity, and joy in Mason’s writing, (2) the cultivation of his bilingual and bicultural identities, and (3) the development of multimodal literacy through artistic representation. The study emphasizes the importance of recognizing writing as a playful and meaningful activity, advocating for an inclusive early childhood writing pedagogy that connects home and school literacy practices. By highlighting the interplay of children’s diverse interests, linguistic and cultural backgrounds, and personal experiences, the research underscores the transformative potential of literacy education to empower young learners from diverse backgrounds. This study provides insights into the role of home-based literacy activities in nurturing children's literacy development, positioning writing as an engaging and joyful practice.
Previous research has highlighted the positive impact of parents on their adult children's fertility plans through childcare, but the association between parental health and fertility expectations remains unclear. Thus, this paper offers a novel perspective on the issue of family support by investigating how caregiving responsibilities toward elderly parents affect adult children’s decision to have a child. Using a long panel dataset for Australia, we examine whether adult children changed their fertility expectations after becoming care providers to their parents. To address issues of unobserved heterogeneity and selection into parenthood and caregiving, we employ generalized difference-in-differences models. Results show a 7% decrease in fertility expectations within two years of becoming a parental caregiver, with a stronger effect over time, consistent across genders and more pronounced for respondents with one child. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at reducing the caregiver burden could provide an opportunity to positively influence fertility levels.
The experience sampling method (ESM) is increasingly used as a clinical tool in mental health care. Currently, ESM studies pay relatively little attention to assessing contextual factors, such as a person’s experience and perception of events, activities, and social interactions. This has been referred to as the ‘contextual black box’. However, personalized context information is essential for applications in clinical settings to gain insight in triggering and maintaining factors of psychopathology. Typically, ESM context items are designed for nomothetic research questions, to capture broad factors that are shared across individuals, such as ‘unpleasant events’. We provide an overview of such nomothetic items. We argue that these items have limited clinical utility and describe idiographic alternatives to ESM context assessment to obtain more specific and personalized information about individual clients. Specifically, we present three existing idiographic ESM techniques to context assessment with clinical potential. First, we illustrate open-ended ESM items that prompt clients to fill in text, such as a description of a specific unpleasant event they experienced. Second, we describe personalized response options and self-learning items that ask clients to define personally relevant response categories, such as types of events the client finds unpleasant. Third, we describe personalized ESM items that client and clinician select or formulate together for concepts of interest. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these idiographic techniques. Additionally, we suggest future directions for clinical research aiming to address the ‘contextual black box’ and enhance the potential of ESM in mental health care.
This study examined the longitudinal relationship between work–family conflict (WFC) and family–work conflict (FWC), with a focus on the moderating role of job demands and home demands, and the mediating role of family distress within dyads (i.e., actor [the employee] and partner). Using data from a survey of 281 married partners (N = 562) from Central Java, Indonesia, in two waves, four months apart, this study’s results revealed that WFC has a spillover effect on FWC in the cross-sectional path, but not longitudinally. Furthermore, family distress actor was found to mediate the relationship between WFC and FWC in the cross-sectional spillover path, whereas family distress partner did not, indicating that family distress underscores the detrimental impact of WFC on family functioning. Additionally, only cognitive job demands were found to moderate the relationships between WFC and family distress actor, WFC and family distress partner, and family distress actor and FWC over time.
BackgroundThis study aimed to evaluate the construct validity and reliability of the newly adapted German version of the Parental Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) in a group of mothers drawn from the general population, with children aged 12–24 weeks. This assessment followed a thorough linguistic validation, which was conducted through a systematic, multi-step translation process.Methods363 women completed the PBQ online 12–24 weeks after delivery. Cronbach’s alpha and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were used to assess internal consistency reliability and construct validity.ResultsThe original 4-factor model could not be confirmed. The new PBQ provides a single factor solution. Ten items were removed from the original 25-item PBQ to produce the abbreviated German PBQ-15, which showed strong internal consistency. The Cronbach’s alpha for this version was 0.86.ConclusionWhile further research is needed to establish diagnostic thresholds and strengthen the construct validity of the shortened version, the German-language 15-item version of the PBQ holds promise as an accessible tool for recognizing bonding issues in a general population of German-speaking women 3–6 months postpartum.
PurposeThe SF-6D Classification System was recently updated (SF-6Dv2). We performed a valuation survey to construct a value set for the SF-6Dv2 in Japan.MethodsAn online discrete choice experiment (DCE) with duration was used to estimate a value set for the SF-6Dv2 for Japan based on public preferences. The target sample number was 3800. Respondents were asked to complete 15 choice tasks. A conditional logit model that estimates interactions between time and each dimension was used to develop the value set.ResultsThe collected sample included 3933 respondents for the DCE tasks. The results of all the unconstrained models showed some inconsistencies. In particular, inconsistencies in the two most severe levels of the role limitation (RL) and vitality (VT) dimensions were observed in all models. The number of inconsistencies was smallest in a core model (n = 3) and in a model for core and common health states (n = 2). The physical functioning (PF) and pain (PA) dimensions had the greatest influence on utility at the overall level across all models. RL, VT, and social functioning (SF) had smaller overall impacts on utility. The PF weights for the two most severe levels are much lower than those in the UK and Australia. The Japanese scores tended to be lower compared with the UK SF-6Dv2 scores.ConclusionWe obtained a value set for Japan (model 5). With the development of this value set, it is now possible to calculate quality-adjusted life years for economic evaluation in Japan when the SF-6Dv2 has been used.
BackgroundHealth utility is a key input used to perform cost-utility analysis (CUA), which is increasingly used to inform resource allocation decisions.ObjectiveTo identify the sources and elicitation methods of health utilities used in CUAs in oncology.MethodsWe used the Tufts Cost-Effectiveness Analysis registry to identify oncology CUAs published in Medline between 1976 and 2021. Eligible CUAs had to include an oncology population (based on ICD-10 codes), report health utilities, and be published in English. The references of cited health utilities were traced to identify the original health utility study and the method of utility elicitation. Characteristic of included CUAs were summarized and the methods to derive health utilities were compared.ResultsA total of 1512 CUAs in oncology were identified. The majority of CUAs (n = 1428, 94.4%) were model-based. Malignant neoplasm of breast and female genital organs was the most common population considered (n = 424, 28.0%). Among these CUAs, 8714 health utilities were identified. Upon review, the sources of 2096 (24.1%) health utilities could not be traced. Of the remaining 6618 health utilities, 1718 (26.0%) were obtained from original health utility study embedded in CUA in which expert opinion (n = 547, 31.8%) or EQ-5D (n = 479, 27.9%) was most frequently used. The 4900 health utilities (74.0%) that were cited from external studies were most often derived using the standard gamble (n = 1258, 25.7%) or EQ-5D (n = 1190, 24.3%).ConclusionPublished health utilities are widely used in oncology CUAs, especially for model-based analyses. However, the identification, selection, and use of health utilities is suboptimal.
Researches indicate that children with dyslexia are more likely to experience psychiatric symptoms throughout life compared to peers in the general population. Improving the classification of psychiatric symptoms in this population can be a valuable goal for strengthing therapeutic models. The current study aimed to evaluate the dynamic associations between internalizing and externalizing symptoms in children with dyslexia using network analysis. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia from April to July 2024, involving 183 children aged 8–11 diagnosed with dyslexia, recruited through convenience sampling from local schools and clinics. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was utilized to assess a range of psychopathological symptoms, focusing on six clusters: affective problems, anxiety problems, somatic symptoms, ADHD symptoms, oppositional defiant problems, and conduct problems. Notably, "cries a lot" emerged as a central symptom in the affective network, while "dependent" was identified as the most pivotal symptom in the anxiety network. Centrality measures—betweenness, closeness, and strength—were employed to quantify the significance of each symptom. The findings suggest that these central symptoms may contribute to the development and persistence of psychiatric comorbidities in children with dyslexia. Interventions targeting these core symptoms could enhance psychological outcomes for this population. Overall, this study lays the groundwork for future research into tailored intervention strategies to address unique psychiatric comorbidities associated with dyslexia.
A growing body of research shows that demographic attitudes and behaviors across the life course are socially stratified. Building on this and focusing on the transition to parenthood, we hypothesize that (i) parental socioeconomic status is associated with multiple dimensions of the transition to parenthood, including fertility norms (perceived lower age limit at first birth), ideals (ideal age at first birth), and behaviors (age at first birth), and that (ii) this association varies across national contexts, as national contexts determine the opportunities and constraints that guide young adults’ life course attitudes and behaviors. Drawing on the European Social Survey 2006 and 2018 data, we analyze early fertility norms and ideals and later fertility behaviors of a pseudo-panel of individuals born between 1976 and 1988. We show that (i) parental socioeconomic status is positively associated with later fertility norms, later fertility ideals, and later childbearing, even when controlling for respondents’ own socioeconomic status, and that (ii) national contexts partially moderate these associations. We conclude by discussing implications for theories of fertility and highlighting avenues for future research.

The relationship between subjective well-being and fear of crime is well-evidenced, but the cost of crime victimization is relatively understudied. We estimate the monetary compensation needed to offset the change from non-victim to victim of burglary or assault, using the compensating income variation method on seven waves of data from the South African Social Attitude Survey conducted in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. We explore the sensitivity of results to different model specifications and utility proxies, including the first-ever utilization of the personal well-being index in compensating income variation research. Results show that models using the personal well-being index have higher predictability, but they produce considerably higher willingness-to-pay or compensating income variation estimates than those using the general life satisfaction questions and the global happiness question. We find the willingness to pay to avoid suffering the consequences of burglary or assault to range between USD 1581 and USD 4242 per year for the average-income person. However, there is large heterogeneity in willingness-to-pay across income groups. The measured value of not suffering burglary or assault along with the high prevalence of victimization in South Africa highlights the substantial financial and societal impacts of crime and the urgent need for targeted policy interventions, particularly in contexts marked by significant income disparities.
Gratitude, a universally cherished positive quality, is intricately linked with individual well-being. Although existing research underscores the role of gratitude as a significant predictor of well-being, enhanced well-being may also contribute to higher levels of gratitude. However, few studies have directly explored the reciprocal dynamics between these constructs. To address this gap, this study employed a longitudinal design with a large sample of 2539 Chinese adolescents (Mage= 17.27,SD= 0.86), and aimed to elucidate the bidirectional interplay between gratitude and both subjective and psychological well-being. Correlation analysis showed that gratitude was significantly and positively related to both types of well-being. Results from cross-lagged analysis revealed that the two components of subjective well-being showed differences in relation to gratitude. Specifically, gratitude predicted cognitive well-being but the reverse is not true. However, a mutual predictive relationship is observed between gratitude and affective well-being, and between gratitude and psychological well-being. Overall, our findings facilitate contribute to a deeper comprehension of the intricate relationship between gratitude and well-being and imply that nurturing adolescents’ well-being could potentially foster the development of their gratitude disposition.
Containment, as a way of restricting mobilities, ranges from physical infrastructures to diffused control practices in everyday life. Alongside their physical, social, and political dimensions, such restrictions also engender various temporal borders and experiences of time particular to situations of containment. A prolific field of research has identified waiting and hope as strategies for both enforcing and surpassing containment. In response, anthropological research on future-making has highlighted a more diverse set of contextual and emergent practices that derive from imagining and realising migrants’ futures. Yet, in contrast to waiting, migrants’ future-making practices have seldom been related to containment. Besides containment informing future-making, migrants and control actors also manipulate time as they plan or experiment with futures to overcome or reinforce containment. Carrying elusive promises of a better future, containment infrastructures can also motivate migrants to stay put and accommodate restrictions to their mobility. This paper addresses how such different relational, often conflicting, practices of envisioning and realising migrant futures contribute to or subvert different types of containment. Building on empirical studies from Turkey, Niger and Kenya we suggest future-making as a relational, practice-oriented and contextual approach suited to trace the negotiation of migrant futures between migrants, control actors, and infrastructures in situations of spatiotemporal containment. We give special attention to resettlement as a form of containment due to its ability to limit mobility through promises of future mobility and its role in negotiating migrant futures. This article serves as a theoretical introduction into the emerging research field of contested future-making in containment and to the corresponding paper cluster.
PurposeInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition affecting the digestive system with symptoms that are often episodic, unpredictable, socially stigmatizing, and impact quality of life. While a timely diagnosis reduces the risk of complications and improves health outcomes, diagnostic delays (DDs) are common. Our study used narratives and data from patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of individuals diagnosed with IBD to examine: (1) What factors helped or hindered achieving a timely diagnosis of IBD? and (2) how do DDs relate to PROMs?MethodsWe conducted a mixed-methods study of 296 individuals diagnosed with IBD in Canada. The survey included a set of validated measures that assessed depression, fatigue, satisfaction with life, disease severity, and several open-ended questions.ResultsThematic analysis of open-ended responses revealed five themes that highlighted the ways a diagnosis was delayed or facilitated: symptom ambiguity, fear and denial, patient-provider communication breakdown, misdiagnosis and self-doubt, and self-advocacy. Quantitative findings revealed that a longer time to receive a diagnosis was significantly correlated with higher levels of depression (r= .26) and fatigue (r= .25), reduced satisfaction with life (r=  − .25), and greater disease severity (r=  − .22). We used the data to generate a framework called the Diagnostic Pathways Model to illustrate the diagnostic process of a chronic disease such as IBD.ConclusionDDs involve the interacting roles of patient, medical, and communication factors, and a DD can negatively impact a patient’s quality of life. Implications for physician–patient communication and public information are discussed.
Research on the children of immigrants born in the host country (G2) consistently reveals disparities between their educational achievements and labour market outcomes compared to the majority population. This study provides new insights into understanding this disparity by examining patterns of overqualification—i.e., a downward educational mismatch—among the G2. Specifically, it explores 1) how overqualification patterns differ between the G2, foreign-born immigrants (G1), and the majority population and 2) how overqualification patterns vary across ten G2 ancestry groups compared to the majority population. Utilizing Swedish total population register data and linear probability models, this study estimates the probability of overqualification across different immigrant generations and ancestry groups, employing the Realised Matches method to measure overqualification. The results indicate that while G2 individuals have a lower probability of experiencing overqualification compared to G1, they face moderately higher probabilities of overqualification than the majority population—up to 19% higher. This disparity is particularly pronounced among G2 individuals with tertiary education and those of Iranian, Middle Eastern and North African, and Other Non-Western origins, with up to 39% higher probabilities. These findings suggest that G2 individuals, particularly those of non-Western origins, encounter significant challenges in translating their educational qualifications into commensurate employment within the Swedish labour market.
ObjectivesThe Gambling Quality of Life Scale -brief (GQoLS-Brief) assesses the impact of gambling disorder (GD) on quality of life (QoL). Preference-based measures are essential for obtaining the quality adjustment weight (i.e. utility score) needed to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in economic evaluations. We aimed to derive a value set for the GQoLS-Brief.MethodsWe employed a discrete choice experiment for preference elicitation. An online survey was administered (n = 928). Respondents completed 10 choice tasks, each presenting two GQoLS-Brief health states alongside life expectancy. Conditional logit regression, parameterized to fit the QALY framework, was used for data analysis. QALY weights for each health state defined by the GQoLS-Brief were calculated.ResultsThe estimated coefficients from the conditional logit models aligned with expectations: utility increased with survival time and decreased with QoL impairment. Utility values for health states ranged from − 1.48 (worse than death) to 1.0. "Financial difficulties" exhibited the highest utility decrement, followed by "Sleep disturbance related to financial difficulties."ConclusionsThis reference set facilitates the calculation of QALYs for economic evaluations of GD interventions. The weight of subjective financial difficulties underscores the need for therapeutic interventions to target this aspect.
Introduction:Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition often accompanied by cognitive impairments, such as difficulties with sustained attention, and emotional disturbances, particularly depression and anxiety. Understanding how these emotional and cognitive factors interact is crucial to improving treatment for fibromyalgia patients. This study aimed to investigate the network structure of these interactions, focusing on the relationship between depression, anxiety, and cognitive performance.Method:A total of one hundred ten participants diagnosed with fibromyalgia completed self-reported assessments of depression and anxiety, alongside cognitive performance tests. Key measures included Continuous Performance Tasks (CPT) for impulsivity and sustained attention, the Stroop Interference Index (StI), Stroop Color Naming (StC), and Stroop Word Reading (StW). Network analysis was conducted to estimate the relationships between emotional and cognitive variables and assess their centrality within the network.Results:Errors in CPT emerged as the most significant indicators of the relationship between depression and cognitive performance, with high centrality values observed for the Stroop tasks (StI, StC, and StW). Additionally, Trait Anxiety (A_T) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) measures showed high centrality, underscoring the critical role of emotional states in the network of cognitive and emotional variables. The centrality values for cognitive flexibility, processing speed, and inhibitory control were found to be 0.85, 0.78, and 0.72, respectively.Conclusion:This study highlights the strong association between depression symptoms and deficits in cognitive domains, emphasizing the need for integrated care approaches that address both cognitive and emotional health. Multidisciplinary treatment programs, including cognitive rehabilitation and psychological support, could improve patient outcomes by targeting the most influential variables in the cognitive-emotional network.
From the perspective of safe asset theory, our paper studies the impact of the safety preference of Chinese household sector on real estate asset allocation. Based on China Household Finance Survey data, our paper shows a significant positive relationship between safety preference in the household sector and the proportion of household assets allocated to real estate. We also show that the impact of households’ safety preference on the proportion of household real estate allocation is weakened by household investment in risky financial assets and household entrepreneurial activities. A heterogeneity analysis shows that real estate assets can better meet the safety needs of households in first-tier cities, in cities with a high unemployment rate, and in cities with a low degree of climate policy uncertainty. Our findings suggests that Chinese household assets include a high proportion of real estate due to their psychological preference for safety. Our study enriches our understanding of the Chinese real estate market and the safe asset theory.
Reflecting a recent guideline for operationalizing subjective wellbeing (OECD,2023), this study tested a model that shows how work-life conflict, one of the key dimensions that detracts from wellbeing outcomes. It does so through a mediating mechanism involving domain satisfaction (i.e., family and work wellbeing), subjective wellbeing, and eudaimonic wellbeing. Specifically, we theorize that work-life conflict detracts from both family and work wellbeing, which in turn decreases subjective wellbeing. In turn, decreases in subjective wellbeing serve to decrease eudaimonic wellbeing. We also argue that work-life conflict has direct adverse effects on both subjective wellbeing and eudaimonic wellbeing. Data collected from the 2016 European Quality of Life Survey were used to test the model; the sample included 18,137 respondents from 33 European countries. The results from multi-level modeling were supportive of our hypotheses. Policy implications were discussed, along with study limitations and suggestions for future research.
PurposeThe Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form version 4.0 (MFSAF v4.0) comprises 7 common MF symptom items (fatigue, night sweats, pruritus, abdominal discomfort, pain under the left ribs, early satiety, bone pain) and is the first patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument designed to assess MF symptom burden. Given that information on the psychometric properties of this instrument has been limited, we sought to evaluate its measurement properties and validate its use in the phase 3 MOMENTUM trial.MethodsData were pooled to assess MFSAF item distribution, structural validity, reliability (test-retest and internal consistency), construct validity (convergent, divergent, and known-groups), and sensitivity to change. Other PRO measures included Patient Global Impression of Severity/Change (PGIS/PGIC), EORTC QLQ-C30, PROMIS Physical Function Short Form 10b, and ECOG performance status.ResultsParticipants (N= 195) showed high completion rates (> 93%) across 24 weeks. Moderate to strong Spearman correlation coefficients among items were mostly observed at baseline (range, 0.289–0.772) and week 24 (range, 0.391–0.829), which supported combining items into a multi-item scale and total score. Internal consistency (Cronbach’s α, 0.877 at baseline and 0.903 at week 24) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, > 0.829) were satisfactory across selected time intervals. Reliability was also supported by McDonald’s omega (ω) coefficient (> 0.875). MFSAF moderately correlated with PRO measures of similar content, differentiated between PGIS and ECOG groups (P< .001), and was able to detect change over time.ConclusionsThe MFSAF v4.0 is a valid tool to assess MF symptom burden, supporting its use in future trials in similar populations.
ObjectiveThis systematic review and bibliometric analysis investigated the keywords appearing most in the pregnancy-related eye disease field to elucidate the current state and trends of pregnancy-related eye disease research.MethodsA systematic literature analysis of pregnancy-related eye disease was performed using the Web of Science Core Collection (WOS) databases. We used the keywords “ocular” OR “eye*” and “pregnancy” OR “pregnant” OR “gestation” to search for articles published from 1999 to 2022. Study data were analyzed and visualized using VOSviewer and CiteSpace.ResultsWe analyzed 929 articles published from 1999 to 2022. From 1999 to 2012, the article number increased slowly, with a marked acceleration in publication frequency after 2013, original papers accounted for 780 (84%) of the total number of articles published. David A. Mackey was the most prolific writer, and Margaret A. Honein contributed the most citations. TheAmerican Journal of Ophthalmology,PLOS One, and theEuropean Journal of Ophthalmologypublished the most articles. TheAmerican Journal of Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,British Journal of Ophthalmology,Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Sciencewere the four most commonly cited journals. The University of Western Australia, the University of Sao Paulo, and the University of Melbourne were highly prolific institutions. Five co-cited references had a citation burst up to 2022, analyzed by CiteSpace. Keyword analysis (VOSviewer) yielded recent key themes (pregnancy, women, eye, risks and diagnosis) and suggested future research directions.ConclusionsThe current results laid the foundation of bibliometrics for scholars and identified researchers, scientific journals, countries, keyword clustering, hot topics, and trends in the literature. High-impact-factor journals contain the most keyword-clustering research and open new horizons for research in the pregnancy-related eye disease nursing field, providing research inspiration for investigators in this field.
This study employs Bayesian inference to explore class-based differences in moral judgment. Based on the dual-process perspective in interdisciplinary action theory, we estimate in a first step a process model which differentiates parametrically between emotionally driven deontological, deliberatively driven utilitarian, and residual judgmental inclinations. In a second step, our estimates of these parameters are correlated via beta regressions with indicators of social class and thinking dispositions. We find a considerable association between social class, specifically income, and deontological inclinations, whereas consequentialist inclinations correlate with thinking dispositions but not with social class. This research underscores the utility of Bayesian estimation in closing the gap between theoretical and statistical modelling. Employing this approach enhances our understanding of the nuanced interplay between intuitive and deliberative processes in moral judgment and, more generally, offers a promising direction for advancing sociological action theory.
Climate change impacts are gendered. This is also true for climate-induced migration, which affects men and women differently. On account of this difference, legal instruments and policies seeking to address and support climate-induced migration need to be gender-focused to address differentiated needs and outcomes. This paper looks at existing policies and legal instruments for the inclusion of gender aspects of climate-related migration. We focus on Ethiopia, India, and Peru, all of them with developed instruments to address the human mobility-climate change nexus. We investigate the scope of provisions concerning gender in relevant instruments in the three country contexts, their likely impact to tackle gender-specific vulnerabilities arising with climate-induced migration and suggest strategies and priorities for enhancing gender-inclusion in policy development and application broadly.
Based on theoretical premises of ecological systems theory and the compensatory hypothesis, a subset of data from the Family Life Project (N= 773), a population-based study of rural families with low incomes, were used to test for associations between maternal literacy in infancy and children’s academic outcomes and teacher-reported problem behaviors in kindergarten. A second aim tested whether increased time in child care averaged from 6 to 36 months moderated such relations. Results indicated that maternal literacy was significantly positively related to academic outcomes (ES= 0.17–0.23) and significantly negatively related to children’s problem behaviors (ES= −0.15) in kindergarten. Child care hours were not significantly related to any outcome. Significant interactions were found between maternal literacy and hours in child care on both children’s academic skills and problem behaviors. Specifically, for mothers with lower literacy levels, significant dose-response relationships were detected between increased time in child care and children’s higher academic scores and reduced problem behaviors (ES= 0.07–0.09). Implications for maternal literacy and child care access among rural families are discussed.
This study conducted a two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) to assess governments’ efficiency in promoting the social conflict management necessary to develop and maintain a state, the human rights of its citizens, and the common prosperity of humanity. We conducted a two-stage DEA, given the multifaceted nature of conflict and conflict resolution. This method facilitates the analysis of the relationship between government policies and social conflicts by separating the exploration of inputs and outputs into two stages. The efficiency values derived from each stage of the DEA were used in the cluster analysis, and the characteristics of efficiency scores across countries were used to exhaustively measure the conflict management capabilities of these nations. The DEA findings indicated that the average social stability efficiency, average social equity efficiency, and average overall social conflict management efficiency of the 53 Country Policy and Institutional Assessments countries examined were 0.8671, 0.9152, and 0.8036, respectively. On these bases, the core policy contribution of this research is the provision of a methodology for segmenting developing countries worldwide and targeting strategies for the future direction of the conflict management policies enacted by international organizations and governments.
Energy poverty has become a significant global challenge, especially in China, the largest developing country, where the problem of energy poverty is more complex and diverse than that of developed countries. In this study, a Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index (MEPI) was constructed from three dimensions: energy-use level, structure, and capacity. Social welfare is quantified using the regional Development and Living Index (DLI) and the spatial effect of MEPI on social welfare is explored using a spatial Durbin model. The findings indicate that energy poverty has a detrimental impact on local and surrounding areas’ social welfare. The energy-use level poverty has the most pronounced negative spillover effect, followed by the energy-use structure poverty, while the energy-use capacity poverty has the weakest impact. Strategies such as high-efficiency energy structure and formal environmental regulation, can mitigate local welfare challenges. Moreover, low-carbon energy structure can mitigate surrounding areas’ welfare challenges. Additionally, the welfare effects of informal regulation and technological innovation have yet to be fully realized. Based on these conclusions, we provide recommendations to policy-makers on how to alleviate energy poverty and promote sustainable development. These include increasing funding for renewable energy projects in the central and western regions, promoting energy efficiency and consumption management in urban and industrial areas, enforcing environmental protection laws, fostering green technology innovation, and enhancing cooperation among regions.
To fully understand and forecast local and regional population change, it is necessary to obtain data for all the demographic components of change—births, deaths, internal migration, and overseas migration. In Australia, and many other countries, high-quality and geographically detailed data is available for most demographic components, but not emigration. The Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes good quality estimates of immigration and emigration at the national and State scales, but available sub-state emigration data is heavily modelled and suffers from quality issues. Good quality sub-state immigration data is available from the census. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of sub-state emigration data for Australia extracted from a large administrative population dataset, the Person Level Integrated Data Asset (PLIDA), which links several administrative datasets. We compared State and sub-state emigration flows from PLIDA to available emigration data, as well as sub-state immigration flows from PLIDA to census-derived immigration flows. We found PLIDA-based emigration flows to be considerably lower in volume than official State emigration estimates, likely due to undercoverage in PLIDA of temporary migrants and residents of remote regions. We discovered sizeable geographical, temporal, age, and visa/citizenship variations in emigration coverage relative to available emigration statistics. Our view is that PLIDA does not yet allow sub-state emigration estimates of sufficient quality for most uses. But we are hopeful that improvements to the population coverage of PLIDA will allow this in the future.
PurposePatient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are well-suited for the longitudinal assessment of quality of life, including depression and physical limitations associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD) that are not routinely assessed in clinical care. This study was designed to gain the patient perspective to facilitate implementation of PROMs into clinical practice for PAD management.MethodsTwenty-three patients with PAD at a single vascular surgery clinic were enrolled for a qualitative interview, July–December 2022. Patients completed PROMIS Physical Function and Depression assessments before undergoing semi-structured interviews. Two researchers used an inductive thematic analysis to analyze emergent themes from transcribed interviews.ResultsThe average age of participants was 69.5 ± 8.2 years; 91% were Caucasian, and 39% were female. Qualitative interviews revealed three implementation-related themes: (1) patient preferences on the timing and type of PROMs collected, (2) PROMs applications in outpatient PAD care, including discussions with their physician, and (3) the clinical value of PROMs. Overall, patients with PAD prefer PROMs related to quality of life and physical function over other domains. Patients appreciate the convenience to complete PROMs before their appointment. Patients would like to verbally discuss meaningful score changes with their providers without the use of graphical aids. Most patients believe PROMs are valuable in their clinical care if their physician reviews the results and the PROM questions apply to their disease symptoms.ConclusionsPatient preferences inform future successful implementations and will improve patient completion rates for the collection and clinical use of PROMs in PAD clinical care.
PurposeMyalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Psychological symptoms are predisposing factors for, as well as symptoms of, ME/CFS. Recovery from ME/CFS is poorly understood and heterogenous, and it is unclear how psychological symptoms may change with recovery. The aim of this study was to examine the associations of depressive and anxious symptoms among individuals with current, previous, and no history of ME/CFS.MethodsNational Health Interview Survey 2022 data were analyzed to assess ME/CFS status, as well as anxiety and depression burden. Adults (unweightedN= 27,651) in the United States reported sociodemographic and health behavior characteristics, with 453 adults reporting current ME/CFS, while 119 reported previous ME/CFS. Sample weights and variance estimation variables were implemented. Multivariable linear regression models were used to analyze the associations between ME/CFS status and anxiety and depression severity after adjusting for sociodemographic and health behavior variables.ResultsParticipants were on average 48.1 years of age, and most identified as female (51.3%), white (76.6%), and not Hispanic or Latine (82.8%). Current and previous ME/CFS were associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to individuals with no history of ME/CFS. Clinically significant levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were substantial for individuals with current (37.6%; 49.0%) and previous (26.5%; 33.4%) ME/CFS compared to individuals with no history of ME/CFS (6.1%; 6.7%).ConclusionME/CFS, regardless of current presence, was related to significantly greater anxiety and depressive symptom burden.
In a principal-principal setting, the presence in the boardroom of independent directors appointed by minority shareholders can provide a unique and effective corporate governance solution to reduce agency costs related to undue appropriation of the private benefits of control by majority shareholders to the detriment of minority ones and compress information asymmetry issues. Independent minority directors acting as conduits of information to the market facilitate further engagement by active shareholders, promote better communication, and reduce disclosure manipulation. The growing relevance of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) related information on decision investment and the easy manipulation of non-financial information has prompted the authors of this paper to investigate whether independent minority directors can play an important monitoring role in conveying non-financial information to the market, thereby reducing managerial self-serving and manipulative practices in non-financial reporting. By examining a sample of Italian-listed companies from 2017 to 2020, we perform a lexicon-based content analysis on their non-financial reports and then use panel data dependence techniques to address our research aim. Our results suggest that, by reducing managerial self-serving and manipulative practices of non-financial reporting, minority shareholders’ representativeness impacts firms’ communication choices. This evidence confirms that independent minority directors are the right path for boosting minority shareholders’ legal protection and ensuring investors’ awareness in the decision-making process.
There is a lack of research on the motivations of fosterers in countries that have traditionally used residential childcare institutions and are now shifting their policies towards family-based foster care. Understanding fosterers’ motives is important for developing an effective and long-term foster care system. The aim of this article is to understand the motivations of fosterers in a society that is undergoing deinstitutionalization process. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 active fosterers in Estonia (11 fosterers were from the Estonian majority and 5 from the Russian-speaking minority). The results show that new fosterers enter the foster care system with the desire to create a family and achieve a permanent arrangement. More experienced fosterers, who have fostered children for years, have done so largely because of the poor conditions in residential childcare institutions in the past. Although the foster care system has undergone significant positive changes, the improvements have not been enough to remove or lessen potential fosterers’ fears about the permanence and predictability of their fostering experience. These fears may lead to a foster care system that is inclined towards an arrangement similar to adoption where people prefer long-term care with fewer and younger children, leaving children who do not correspond to these criteria to remain in residential childcare institutions.
Financial resilience is the capacity of individuals to effectively mitigate the impacts of adversities by utilizing appropriate resources. Previous studies primarily assess financial resilience using an ex-post approach, evaluating resilience after a shock has occurred, causing additional stress for households. Conversely, ex-ante assessments rely heavily on economic resources like savings and emergency funds to mitigate adverse effects. However, in developing countries with underdeveloped financial systems, access to financial services is a major challenge. Households in these regions rely on a variety of resources, capabilities, and networks to remain resilient. Thus, both ex-post and ex-ante approaches are limited by being narrow, unidimensional, and backward-looking. This paper posits that financial resilience is a forward-looking, multidimensional concept emphasizing ex-ante preparedness for future adversities using internal and external resources. We propose a financial resilience framework encompassing financial inclusion, financial literacy, digital literacy, participatory decision-making, and social capital. Using data from the 2016 Intermedia’s Financial Inclusion Insight Survey of India and employing multivariate statistical techniques, including multiple correspondence analysis and principal component analysis, we develop a composite measure of financial resilience. Our analysis identifies vulnerable segments of the population, suggesting that only about 2% of adults are financially resilient, while one-fourth are financially vulnerable. Specifically, adults in rural areas, females, younger and older individuals, those with low education levels, and individuals without full-time employment are more likely to be financially vulnerable. We discuss policy implications aimed at enhancing financial inclusion, financial and digital literacy, and women’s empowerment to better protect against future shocks.
In recent years, scholarly attention to the relationship between housing wealth and its broader social and political implications has intensified, particularly in response to growing wealth disparities in advanced capitalist societies since the 1980s. These disparities have been further exacerbated by shifts in labor market conditions and welfare reforms that have increased income and employment instability. This study investigates the interplay between homeownership, income, and social trust in South Korea, employing path analysis to explore both the direct and indirect effects of homeownership on social trust, with perceived autonomy serving as a mediating factor. Furthermore, the analysis examines how homeownership and income jointly influence autonomy and social trust, with a specific focus on the moderating role of income. The findings reveal a positive association between homeownership, autonomy, and social trust, with homeowners generally exhibiting higher levels of both compared to non-homeowners. However, as income rises, these differences diminish, underscoring the moderating effect of income. These results highlight the pivotal role of homeownership, particularly for individuals facing heightened income insecurity. In contexts such as South Korea, where real estate constitutes a substantial share of assets, disparities in homeownership are pronounced, and welfare systems providing income-based support are limited, the study emphasizes how homeownership critically shapes social perceptions.
PurposeTo explore the characteristic quality of health profiles of children with paediatric acquired brain injury (pABI), and to investigate whether improvement in executive function (EF) following cognitive rehabilitation is associated with improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQOL).MethodA study of secondary endpoints in a blinded, parallel-randomised controlled trial with children (ages 10–17 years) with pABI and executive dysfunction. Data was obtained from 73 children-parent dyads. Explorative analyses were conducted comparing baseline with 8-week post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up data. Outcome measures included the EQ-5D-Y-3L health dimensions and the visual analogue scale (VAS).ResultsAt baseline and 6-month follow-up, mean (SD) VAS were 76.22 (17.98) and 79.49 (19.82) on the parent-report, and 77.19 (16.63) and 79.09 (17.91) on the self-report, respectively. Comparing children who improved EF to those who did not improve/worsened, no significant improvement was found for the VAS (parent-report) over time (BRIEF-BRI:F= 2.19,p= 0.12, BRIEF-MI:F= 2.23,p= 0.12) for either group. A significant main effect by group was found for BRIEF-MI (F= 4.02,p= 0.049), but no time*group interaction (F= 0.414,p= 0.662).ConclusionThe children and their parents reported only minor problems across EQ-5D-Y-3L dimensions and evaluated overall health as relatively good. Participants with a clinically significant change in the metacognitive aspect of EF had higher HRQOL. Cognitive interventions aiming to ameliorate deficits in EF in pABI may be beneficial to improve HRQOL.
Although there is recent growing attention on mental health and mental well-being across the globe, supports in this area of healthcare can be a challenge for immigrant and racialized groups with experiences of hardship across several domains. This study aimed to gather perspectives from immigrants and racialized community members on strategies central to support their mental health and well-being, with the aim of addressing research to practice gaps. The study was co-designed in collaboration with a Community Action Table in Markham, Ontario, a setting with 93% of residents self-identifying as visible minorities. Using a community-focused mixed methods Concept Mapping approach, 68 residents, service providers, and policymakers were engaged through three phases of brainstorming, sorting and rating, and interpretation. Their brainstorming led to 68 statements which they sorted into groups and rated for importance and feasibility to act in next six months. Further analysis led to a 9-cluster concept map comprising of Family Wellness, Awareness & Education, Cultural Sensitivity, Social Service Access, Community Building, Socioeconomic, Food Security, Healthcare Access, and Housing Stability. These clusters are important in advancing knowledge on ways to support and prioritize mental health and well-being of immigrants and racialized communities. Overall, participants viewed mental health and well-being as being closely tied to their living and working conditions while also focusing on family wellness and intergenerational dynamics. Novel insights from this project are important for the planning of mental health and well-being supports for immigrant groups in Canada and can help improve foci across sectors through service implementation.
The training programs in marriage and family therapy have received criticism for providing multicultural counseling to diverse populations from White and Western perspectives. Training programs provide less focus on the training needs around cultural competency and cultural humility for students of color. This research study is a phenomenological approach to understand the experiences of students of color in their MFT training programs and during their early clinical experiences, as they developed their multicultural counseling competencies. After interviewing eight participants about their lived experience, data was analyzed via a thematic analysis and resulted in identifying three themes. (1) There are specific multicultural counseling skills that participants frequently use (2) Learning in a White environment means learning without adequate representation, without diverse content and research, and without discussions focusing on diversity. (3) MFT programs need to incorporate a more diverse training approach including increased diversity in its faculty, literature, and general content.
This paper provides a new explanation for the limited participation puzzle in the Chinese financial market from the perspective of traditional family values. Using the 2013 and 2015 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data, this paper finds a negative relationship between traditional family values and household investment in risky financial assets. We provide evidence that traditional family values increase residents’ risk preferences, precautionary savings, and housing asset investment mechanisms, and therefore influence household asset allocation. The study also finds that the inhibitory effect of traditional family values on household investment in risky financial assets is more pronounced in rural households, central and western regions, and areas with lower internet penetration and openness to external influences.
Studies on marriage make important contributions to the psychosocial health of individuals. In recent years, there are cases where the marital relationship has been negatively affected due to the use of social media. In this context, the concept of digital stress emerges as a current problem. We have less information about the mechanisms underlying the dyadic relationships of married individuals. This study reports the results of 325 married couples using actor-partner interdependence modeling. The mean age of women was 36.19 (SD = 7.83, range = 21–60) and the mean age of men was 39.12 (SD = 8.55, range = 24–67). Digital stress, mindfulness in marriage, and marital adjustment were measured among married individuals. According to the results, women’s digital stress significantly predicted women’s mindfulness in marriage. Similarly, men’s digital stress significantly predicted women’s mindfulness in marriage. Furthermore, women’s mindfulness in marriage significantly predicted both women’s and men’s dyadic adjustment. Men’s mindfulness in marriage also significantly predicted women’s and men’s dyadic adjustment. It was found that women’s mindfulness in marriage has an indirect effect on the relationship between their digital stress and dyadic adjustment. In addition, men’s mindfulness in marriage has an indirect effect on the relationship between their digital stress and dyadic adjustment. These findings indicate that digital stress plays a significant role in marital relationships, and mindfulness is one of the key mechanisms in these interactions. It is suggested that interventions aimed at increasing mindfulness in marriage could mitigate the negative effects of digital stress and strengthen dyadic adjustment in couples.
With a view of children as social negotiators, this study explored how preschool children’s voices were nurtured through the implementation of an early-writing/applied phonics approach called Kid Writing (KW). The approach encouraged children to compose writing from their lives as they were guided by an adult who scaffolded the writing process. An analysis of classroom observations, focus groups, and children’s work samples revealed the extent to which preschool children’s voices, motivation, and writing capabilities were supported. Imperative to children’s success as writers in this study was the expansion of preschool teachers’ views of what counts as writing. By legitimizing the full developmental continuum of children’s early writing attempts, including scribbling, mark-making, drawing, and early letter formation, the results of this study documented what young children are capable of when they are empowered to self-express through their joy of writing. The findings disrupt the notion that preschool children are not ready to write. Rather, children’s overall literacy learning is supported by providing opportunities for preschoolers to write from their lived experiences.
We investigated the relationship between parent and child mental health, including parents’ general psychological distress, among refugees resettled in Australia. We utilised longitudinal data from a sample (N= 602 children and 377 parents) of recently settled refugees from the Building a New Life in Australia Survey). Parent psychological distress and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were measured by the Kessler 6 and PTSD-8, respectively.HarshandWarmparenting behaviours were also measured to explore the mechanisms underlying the parent-child mental health relationship. Child mental health was measured using the SDQ. Using path analysis, we found that increases in parent psychological distress directly contribute to harsher parenting practices, which in turn increase child mental health difficulties as reported by parents. Parent psychological distress at Waves 1 and 3 also directly impacted child emotional and conduct difficulties, whilst parent PTSS was indirectly associated with all measured child mental health problems. While both parent PTSS and psychological distress indirectly impacted child mental health, only psychological distress directly impacted on any area of child mental health difficulty and overall explained more variance in the final model. Our findings highlight that non-trauma specific symptoms warrant attention in refugee parents’ and children’s mental health. Clinicians should assess for general psychological symptoms in addition to trauma-specific symptoms, and we recommend that parental mental health is assessed and treated simultaneously when working with refugee children. Moreover, to reduce the impact of other stressors in refugees’ lives, community sector organisations should be resourced adequately to support refugee families in settlement.
PurposeThe COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent mitigation efforts impacted communities in many ways and placed immense strain on the health care system, impacting access to services. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in prevalence of child health care, child health, and caregiver and household health within children with autism and children with special health care needs (CSHCN) pre-pandemic to early pandemic years.MethodsWe examined data from the National Survey of Children’s Health to examine changes in child health care, child health, and caregiver and household health for autistic children and CSHCN from 2018 to 2021.ResultsAbout one-third of children with autism and CSHCN missed preventive checkups due to the COVID-19 pandemic and half had virtual care in 2021. Parents of children with autism had less help with care coordination in 2020 compared to previous years. In CSHCN prevalence of anxiety increased from 2018/2019 to 2021, with a concurrent increase in need for mental health care, this was not seen in children with autism. Finally, difficulty paying medical bills and for food was less common in 2020 and 2021 (compared to 2018/2019).ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic changed the healthcare landscape for everyone, including children with autism and CSHCN as highlighted in this study. Understanding the disruptions and how they impacted populations differently can be helpful in informing plans long-term emergency preparedness. This planning should involve disability inclusive policies, to ensure the most vulnerable groups retain health care access as needed.
PurposeThrombotic cardiovascular diseases profoundly impact patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments that are disease-specific or antithrombotic-treatment focused, developed according to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on PROs, and can be used in clinical trials, are lacking. The aim of this study was to understand concepts important to patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), atrial fibrillation (AF), or stroke who require antithrombotic treatment for reducing risk of future thrombotic events (indications being evaluated for an investigational new drug), identify PROs that measure relevant symptoms and impacts, and determine acceptability of PROs from a health technology assessment (HTA) perspective.MethodsA landscape review, conducted between January 2009 and October 2020, included a search of qualitative literature (OVID), a review of PRO instruments using multiple sources (e.g., OVID and clinical trials databases), and a survey of HTA decisions for antithrombotic medications.ResultsThe qualitative literature review identified 27 publications used to develop a high-level conceptual summary of symptoms and HRQoL impacts reported by patients. The instrument landscape review indicated that generic PROs have been utilized for thrombotic indications, but disease-specific, fit-for-purpose instruments are lacking, and the HTA review revealed that although HTA agencies discussed PRO instruments, evidence of specific recommendations was not found.ConclusionTo ensure patients’ experiences, perspectives, and priorities are incorporated into drug development and evaluation, a core set of PROs for thrombotic indications that meet health authority guidance and are acceptable to HTA agencies is needed.
Climatic variability has been linked to multiple demographic and health outcomes, which have important implications for human welfare and development. Despite the importance of these outcomes, few studies have examined its impact on household size. Household size is an important correlate of wellbeing and is driven by multiple demographic processes that may be affected by environmental shocks such as heat and drought. This paper describes these links conceptually, and then empirically examines how exposure to climate anomalies affects household size and three underlying components—fertility, marriage, and family agglomeration—that are observed in our data. We examine these relationships by linking harmonized census microdata from 11 sub-Saharan African countries with high-resolution climate data from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and modeling the effects of recent temperature and precipitation exposures on the outcomes of interest. Our analyses indicate that high temperatures may be associated with increases in household size. Models of the underlying demographic components of household size suggest that these temperature effects may be driven by increases in fertility and men’s marriage, assuming the latter involves marriage into an existing household. Evidence from exploratory country-specific models reveals significant spatial heterogeneity, raising important questions about the contextual moderators of climate-family dynamics for future research.
ObjectivesThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends clinicians who treat pediatric patients screen for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) to facilitate the identification of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and promote timely access to behavioral and cognitive interventions. We evaluated how frequently clinicians inquire about PAE in their pediatric patient interactions and the methods used to ascertain this information.MethodsWe analyzed data from the Fall 2020 DocStyles survey, a web-based survey of primary healthcare professionals (n = 1754). Distributions for frequency of assessing PAE history for five pediatric populations and the methods used were calculated by clinician specialty (family practitioners [FP], pediatricians, and nurse practitioners/physician assistants [NP/PAs]) and overall. Chi-square and Bonferroni post-hoc tests determined whether frequency of assessing PAE history varied by specialty.ResultsAmong 779 clinicians serving pediatric patients, approximately 70.5%, 63.0%, and 60.7% reported often/always obtaining PAE history from parents of children with developmental/behavioral issues, adopted/foster children, and newborns, respectively. By contrast, less than half of respondents reported often/always collecting this information from parents of infants (47.6%) and new patients (38.2%). Most respondents reported collecting PAE history through interviews conducted by physicians or physician assistants (69.7%). Obtaining PAE history varied by specialty; pediatricians (71.5%) were more likely to collect PAE history for adopted/foster children when compared to FPs (57.7%,p= 0.003).Conclusions for PracticePAE history is not routinely obtained for pediatric patients. These findings highlight the need for trainings and practice supports to aid clinicians in identifying and treating children at-risk of FASDs.
The State-wide Outreach Perinatal Services – Mental Health (SwOPS) is a telehealth consultation liaison service aimed at bridging the gap in perinatal mental health service provision in rural and remote areas across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The service enables health professionals working within the NSW health service to refer perinatal women with moderate-to-severe or complex mental health conditions for assessment and treatment advice by a perinatal psychiatrist and senior clinical nurse consultant. There is, however, limited research evaluating the impact of the service. The current study represents the first qualitative investigation into the experiences of health professionals accessing the SwOPS service. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 health professionals from rural, remote and metropolitan areas who had experience with the SwOPS service. Data was analysed using a thematic analysis approach, four themes and 14 sub-themes were identified: accessing the SwOPS service (limited resources in rural and remote areas, expert advice, and education and clinical supervision), unique and valuable service (easy access and reduction in wait-times, reduces admission and re-presentation, and service providers and capacity building), benefits to health professionals (education, peer networking and community of practice, comprehensive reports), and room for improvement (need for increased resources, cultural sensitivity, expand service, access to electronic medical record, and improve marketing). Results highlight the limited resources available to rural and remote perinatal mental health services providers. Further, findings highlight the need for services such as SwOPS to help bridge the gap in the provision of mental health services and rural and remote areas.
ObjectivesThis study aims to assess if an integrated simulation-based training on respectful maternity care (RMC) and management of obstetric and neonatal emergencies could improve the quality of antenatal care (ANC).MethodsThe data are from two cross-sectional surveys administered in the East Mamprusi District of Northern Ghana in 2017 to evaluate the impact of integrated simulation-based training for healthcare providers. Surveys were administered to two groups of women aged 15–49 who delivered in a health facility before (baseline;n= 266) and 6 months after (end-line;n= 320) the intervention began. We assessed the quality of antenatal care pre- and post-training across two dimensions: service provision and experience of care. Analyses included linear and logistic regression.ResultsWomen in the end-line group reported higher quality of antenatal care than those in the baseline group. The average ANC experience of care score increased by 10 points at the end-line (Coeff = 10.3, 95%CI: 9.0,11.6), whereas the mean ANC service provision score increased by three points (Coeff = 2.6, 95% CI: 2.2, 3.1). End-line participants were more likely to have an ultrasound (OR: 24.1, 95%CI: 11.5, 50.3). Parity, tribe, education, employment, partner occupation, six or more antenatal visits, ANC facility, and provider type were also associated with ANC quality.ConclusionsIntegrated simulation-based training for health providers has the potential to improve the quality of ANC. Incorporating such training into continuing professional development courses will aid global efforts to increase the quality of care throughout the maternity continuum of care.
This study examines how young, unmarried, working people’s fertility intention is shaped by future scenarios where flexible working arrangements (FWAs) are the default. The unmarried population remains to be an under-studied part of the working population at reproductive ages, who nevertheless becomes increasingly significant for fertility research due to rising ages at marriage and the first birth. Despite significant public anticipation regarding the potential of FWAs to facilitate work–family balance and fertility, there is little research on the effects of FWAs on fertility intentions. We conduct a population-based vignette survey experiment to identify the causal effects of FWAs by randomly manipulating three scenarios of FWAs policy changes—reducing hours, increasing work-schedule flexibility, and increasing workplace flexibility—in Singapore, where both overwork norm and low fertility co-exist. All three types of FWAs improve fertility intentions. The effects are especially substantial for women, for which anticipated work–family conflict is an important mediator. Moreover, FWAs matter particularly to those in professional and managerial occupations. These findings call for policies facilitating a more family-friendly environment to tackle low fertility in the future of work.
Diverse social ties are critical facilitators of well-being among older adults. Social ties might be especially important for aging immigrants who face multiple social and economic vulnerabilities over the life course. We investigated social ties (e.g., partners, children, other family, and friends) by immigrant status among older adults in the United States (U.S.). Data come from the 2018 Health and Retirement Study (N= 4,006), a national sample of older adults in the U.S. We used multivariable logistic regression to compare social ties (e.g., partners, children, other family, and friends) by immigrant status. We further explored interactions with sex and race/ethnicity. Older immigrants are more likely to report that they can rely a lot on their partners (aOR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.27, 2.68) but less likely to rely on friends (aOR = 0.72, 95% CI, 0.55, 0.94) compared to non-immigrants. Older immigrants are also less likely to meet frequently with friends (aOR = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.51, 0.86) and with other family (aOR = 0.71, 95%, CI, 0.55, 0.91) compared to non-immigrants. Lastly, older immigrant men are significantly less likely to meet with friends compared to non-immigrant men (aOR = 0.48, 95% CI, 0.32, 0.73). As the older population in the U.S. continues to diversify and immigrant older adults navigate their support options, older immigrants–especially men–may be at risk for less variation in their social support options, particularly from extended family members and friends.
Socio-Technical Systems (STS) Theory is an organisation theory used to study the relationships, interdependencies, and interactions between social elements such as people and structures, and technical elements of task and physical systems. STS has recently gained popularity in the digital health field. To better understand how socio-technical systems can be used to research the health information management field, this paper explores STS theory from its origin, four different approaches, and their application in various studies. Leveraging knowledge gained from other industries on using socio-technical systems, an example of privacy demonstrates this theory’s application in current research examining HIM professionals’ contribution to patient safety in Australian acute hospitals. The article further explores why this approach is suitable for studying this workforce and why this theory remains relevant today.
Partisans hold negative and inaccurate stereotypes of members of the out-party. In this paper we test the effectiveness of exposure to counter-stereotypical exemplars as a strategy for changing stereotypes and reducing partisan animosity. This strategy builds on the exemplification theory of stereotype formation, which holds that stereotypes of out-groups are constructed from exemplary group members that are salient in an individual’s memory. Drawing on an established experimental paradigm for studying racial stereotypes, we test this theory using an experiment that exposes partisans to either ideologically stereotypical or ideologically counter-stereotypical exemplars of their out-party. This strategy is notably more indirect than most strategies tested to reduce affective polarization, which rely on directly providing information, often in the form of misperception correction, about the distribution of out-party views. Despite this more indirect approach, our results suggest that exposure to counter-stereotypical exemplars can moderate stereotypes of partisan ideology and improve affect towards the out-party, relative to exposure to stereotypical exemplars. These results have important implications for our understanding of how negative and inaccurate views of the out-party form, and also suggest methods for reducing partisan animosity.
Period fertility rates usually subside in precarious times. The United Kingdom’s (UK) decision to leave the European Union (EU) may be seen as a typical example of a policy choice that creates uncertainty. Did Brexit-related uncertainty influence fertility rates in the UK? With regional data at the Nuts 3 level from Eurostat, we apply Difference-In-Difference (DID) and panel time event regression analysis to answer this query. The obtained estimates suggest that the Leave decision significantly reduced regional total fertility rates in the UK in the short run. We also noted a negative effect on fertility in the post-referendum period across both UK and non-UK European regions. Our findings may be a piece of the puzzle regarding the prolonged fertility decline observed in many developed nations during the 2010s.
Living in a stepfamily can be stressful due to several challenges that confront individuals within stepfamilies, hence adaptive coping is vital for wellbeing. Nonetheless, little research focus has been devoted to understating how individuals within stepfamilies cope with family-related distresses. Using a qualitative exploratory approach, this study explored coping strategies used by 11 stepparents and 22 adolescent stepchildren in the Ghanaian context. Findings show that whereas stepchildren adopted a wide range of coping strategies which were mostly emotion-focused, stepparents used less diverse strategies. Nonetheless, both groups used strategies that were both emotion-focused and problem-focused although, for stepchildren, two of the problem-solving strategies were maladaptive. Findings reflect the imbalanced power hierarchy that exists within the stepfamily household that tends to disadvantage stepchildren. Implications of the findings are discussed.
Annual surveys continue to demonstrate an increasing prevalence of mental health difficulties among college students, resulting in increasing help seeking behaviors. One factor identified as predicting both well-being and mental health symptoms among college students is family functioning. The Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale IV (FACES-IV) is a popular instrument that assesses family functioning for use in both clinical and research contexts. However, the FACES-IV has not been specifically validated among the college student population. This study examined the psychometric properties of the FACES-IV with 684 primarily female college students from 18 colleges and universities across the northeastern, midwestern, and southern United States in 2018. Given the data, an alternative three-factor model of the FACES-IV was explored with the sample. Implications for using the FACES-IV in research and practice with college students are discussed.
PurposeAdults with arthritis experience poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL), though research often focuses on single HRQOL outcomes or summary scores. We aimed to identify HRQOL profiles in adults with different arthritis types and determine risk and protective factors.MethodsData including PROMIS-29 Profile v2.1 and PROMIS Short Form v2.0 – Emotional Support 4a were collected through a national foundation’s online survey of adults with arthritis in the U.S. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to characterize the heterogeneity in arthritis patients by clustering them into HRQOL profiles, based on statistical model fit and clinical interpretability. We fit a multinomial logistic regression model with HRQOL profile assignment as the outcome to determine associations with protective and risk factors.ResultsWe included 25,305 adults with arthritis. The LPA results favored a five-HRQOL profile solution (entropy = 0.83). While some profiles displayed better HRQOL in some domains, 93% of the sample displayed impacted pain and physical functioning. One profile (20%) displayed mean T-scores nearly 2 standard deviations below the population mean. Despite poor physical HRQOL outcomes, one profile (10%) displayed average mental health. All demographic and clinical factors contributed significantly to the model, including risk factors (arthritis types, work status) and protective factors (more emotional support, starting exercise).ConclusionWe identified profiles with consistently impacted HRQOL in arthritis, though one displayed average mental health functioning despite poor physical functioning. These results highlight the value of considering the patient’s HRQOL experience alongside treatment options, and the potentially positive impact of non-pharmacological interventions.
This article builds on conversations about the nature of a pedagogy specifically for babies, which are defined in this paper as 0–2 year olds. To do this, we explore articulations of social purpose and social pedagogy among 15 baby room educators working in UK nurseries. Our findings suggest four types of social purpose and four types of social pedagogy that inform what baby educators do, how they do it and why they do it. The baby educators in our study articulated their social purpose in terms of providing a secure foundation for childhood and adulthood; acting as a support system for parents; enabling healthy early development; and inspiring learning across the lifespan. Correspondingly, they identified their social pedagogy in terms of giving care and nurture to meet physical and emotional needs; cultivating parent partnerships; planning activities, interactions and resources around developmental goals; and creating provocations to stimulate learning based on individual interests. We hope that this typology helps to deepen our understanding of what baby educators experience and the pedagogies they enact day to day, as well as acting as a reflective tool for baby room educators to use to deepen their practice.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical need for reliable energy access, underscoring energy poverty as a significant barrier to social well-being and sustainable development. This study develops a comprehensive multidimensional index to assess energy poverty in developing countries using a hybrid approach that integrates fuzzy set theory with Delphi, DEMATEL, and ANP methods. By evaluating 33 indicators across five dimensions—availability, adequacy, affordability, cleanability, and convenience—this study refines the list to 19 key indicators through expert consensus and constructs a cause-and-effect relationship among them. The analysis identifies electricity consumption per capita as the most critical indicator of energy poverty. The index is applied to 119 developing countries, revealing stark disparities, with Chile having the lowest and Chad the highest energy poverty scores. The findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions and policy measures to enhance energy access and reduce socioeconomic inequalities, thereby supporting the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7). This study offers a robust framework for policymakers and researchers to address energy poverty effectively in the post-COVID-19 era.
In comparison to resident fathers, non-resident fathers face formidable challenges in maintaining a consistent presence in their children’s lives. Such challenges tend to exist on multiple contextual levels--intrapersonal, interpersonal, neighborhood, community, cultural, and societal. We conducted semi-structured, qualitative interviews with a sample of eight participants who identified as an African American, biological, non-resident father to at least one child, ages 5–17. We explored barriers and facilitators to their involvement on five contextual levels—self, co-parenting, family, social/community, and societal. We employed a phenomenological methodology which revealed numerous barriers to involvement with children, including the father’s own personal lived experiences, conflictual co-parenting and family dynamics, engagement in the street lifestyle, and challenges with parenting across multiple households. Findings also revealed several supports to involvement with children, including the father’s determination to be involved and growth mindset toward fathering, positive and supportive co-parenting relationships, family support, and fatherhood programs. The results of this study are intended to provide contextually-based insights for service providers that can be translated into service delivery and applied to programs that focus on eliminating barriers and increasing supports to father involvement, thereby improving child well-being and enhancing family functioning.
PurposeTo develop the Norwegian value set for the EQ-5D-5L based on interviews with a representative sample of the Norwegian adult population.MethodsRandom and quota sampling were used to recruit the sample of adults (age> 18 years) representative of the Norwegian general population. Data collection followed EQ-VT 2.1 undertaken before and after the COVID-19 pandemic from November 2019 to December 2022, using PC-assisted and video conferencing interviews, respectively. Each respondent valued 10 health states using composite time trade-off (cTTO) and 7 health states using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Different statistical models were assessed for logical consistency and predictive accuracy using cTTO and DCE data alone or in combination as hybrid models.ResultsOf the 1,321 respondents, 1,237 met inclusion criteria. All statistical models demonstrated logical consistency. The weighted hybrid model combining both cTTOand DCE data was preferred and had the highest predictive accuracy. Predicted values ranged from -0.453 to 1, and the dimension of anxiety/depression was the most highly valued by respondents, followed by pain/discomfort, self-care, mobility, and usual activities. These findings are not dissimilar to those for most Western European countries, and regression coefficients are closest to those for other Scandinavian countries.ConclusionThis study provides the Norwegian value set for the EQ-5D-5L based on health state values obtained from members of the adult general population in Norway. This is an important contribution to economic evaluation and the broader application ofthe EQ-5D-5L in Norway including clinical and health services research, and quality measurement.
Autonomy is essential for the emancipation and viability of systems and empowers individuals and teams to make decisions and act with flexibility and agility. This becomes particularly significant in volatile environments, where rapid decision-making is particularly important for system responsiveness. The viable system model (VSM) advocates maximum operational autonomy as a fundamental condition of viability. Having autonomy structured in a system is core to a viable design. While ensuring operational autonomy is core for effective response in complex and volatile environments, the paper explores through a case study some reasons why autonomy may not be exercised properly in the middle of a crisis. It does so by analysing the factors that influence how delegated autonomy is perceived and exercised in a multi-agency emergency response system during its operations. It does so by analysing qualitative data collected in a UK county that responded to a major disaster. The findings suggest that discrepancies resulting from systemic and social factors such as identity, values, ethos, and risk aversion created difficulties for operational teams in responding autonomously. The paper offers three contributions to VSM First, it provides insight into the importance of including social awareness and systemic analysis in viability diagnosis to ensure its practical value. Second, it suggests ways to deepen this type of analysis and further clarify the VSM theory about challenges to developing operational autonomy. Third, it contributes to the discourse on system emancipation in soft OR by showing the significance of multi-methodological diagnosis that it includes, in addition to structural diagnosis, identifying conflicts among systems elements as well as human interactions and interpretations.
In explaining national identity as an indicator of subjective belonging to the nation-state, researchers have examined factors such as occupational structure, economic discrimination, competition, and political recognition. However, the influence of cultural factors has often been neglected. By investigating the moderating effect of Shia and Sunni rituals on national identification, I find that the nature of rituals significantly influences the strength of national identity among subordinate ethnic groups. In Shia culture, the solidarity generated through ritual practices extends into national identity, fostering the formation of a confessional supra-identity. In contrast, rituals centered on personal piety in Sunni Islam do not produce the same effect. I propose a theory of interethnic solidarity based on ritual processes. A qualitative analysis of the cases of Turkey and Iran shows that in Turkey, the absence of cross-ethnic ties forged through less intense rituals leads to weaker national identity among Sunni Kurds and higher perceived ethnic discrimination. In Iran, however, the frequent practice of interactive rituals that transcend ethnic boundaries strengthens national identity among Shia ethnic minorities and reduces perceived ethnic discrimination. This research underscores how communal, intensive rituals play a key role in explaining variations in national identification.
At present, research exploring educator’s understandings of displays of student work is scant yet such displays are regularly exhibited within the community spaces of early learning and elementary schools. These displays communicate messages to those within the space about teacher and student agency, curricular priorities, children and their work, and the relationship between teaching and learning. Grounded in a framework of documentality and teacher vision, this paper explores the ways in which preservice teachers (PSTs) understand teacher-cultivated, student work documentation. This research used a Photo-Elicitation Interview methodology to develop a descriptive account of PSTs' visions and understandings of teacher-cultivated, classroom documentation and displays of children's work. Findings reveal that PSTs held paradoxical views of student work documentation teetering between an appreciation of an adult-centered aesthetic disconnected from their academic and creative capacities to an expressed valuing of an agentic positioning of children in the experiences of the classroom.
Most prior U.S. political discussion research has failed to pay close attention to the networks of political independents, and to the differences between true partisans, leaners, and true independents. This is in direct contrast to the (appropriately) growing research attention paid to the decades-long rise in the proportion of independents and the decline of true partisans. This study presents representative U.S. survey data that compares political discussion frequency, network size, and the partisan composition of the discussion networks of partisans, leaners, and independents. After applying controls for ideological strength and political interest, we find that the three groups do not differ in discussion frequency or network size. However, there are meaningful differences across the groups in three different network composition measures, including partisan bias. We interpret our findings in the context of both applied measurement considerations and normative democratic expectations of partisan diversity within discussion networks.
PurposeAssessing socioeconomic status (SES), mental health, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in young children is crucial for making informed health care decisions and identifying areas of intervention. The present study aimed to investigate potential associations between SES, mental health, and HRQoL in 5–7-year-old children.MethodThe present study included mother-reported health assessments for 621 children aged 5–7 years in Grade 1 collected between 2019 and 2023 as part of theStarting Right™project. Online questionnaires were used to support public health nurses in assessing children’s health status. HRQoL (KIDSCREEN-27, 5 subscales) and mental health [Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), 4 subscales] were assessed. Sociodemographic characteristics, sex, maternal education, and income were obtained from Statistics Norway. The data were analyzed using multiple robust regression.ResultsMother-reported mean scores for the KIDSCREEN-27 were within the normal range compared with European norms (8–11 years). However, for each KIDSCREEN-27 dimension, there were individuals whose mothers reported scores that were substantially lower than average. Having mental health problems, defined as being in the 80th and 90th percentiles of the SDQ Total problem score, was associated with 2.1–10.7-point lower KIDSCREEN-27 scores (p< 0.001–0.021), which was most noticeable in the KIDSCREEN-27 school environment subscale. Weak but significant positive associations were found between SES and HRQoL.ConclusionOur results provide important insights into the associations between SES, mental health, and HRQoL in young children. Given the strong association between mental health problems and HRQoL in Grade 1 children, the assessment of both is essential, so that early interventions, an improved caring environment, and nurturing support can be initiated.
PurposeThe aim was to compare quality of life (QoL) of patients with testosterone recovery (TR) to patients without TR after the completion of either 18- or 36-month androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer.MethodsFrom a Phase III trial, we selected all 630 randomised patients with testosterone measured at baseline (during screening, before randomisation) and follow-up and who completed baseline, 6-month and, at least, one further QoL questionnaire in follow-up (EORTC 30 - PR25). We estimated means and standard deviation of items and scales for each group at each time point. We analyzed items and scales scores with general linear model with repeated measures to evaluate changes between patients with or without TR to a normal level. p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with Benjamini-Hochberg’s false discovery rate procedure (padj). A padj< 0.05 was considered significant and mean differences of 10 points or more considered clinically relevant.Results494 patients retained for analysis (median follow-up 16.2 years). A significantly higher number of patients (177/314 vs 79/180, p = 0.008) recovered a normal testosterone level in a significantly shorter time [median (IQR): 3.06 (2.55–3.65) vs 5.00 years (4.5–5.96), p < 0.001] in the 18- vs the 36-month cohort. Patients with TR had a significantly better QoL: 37/55 items and 14/21 scales (padj<0.05) in the 18-month and 25/55 items and 13/21 scales in the 36-month cohort. Moreover, 9 items and one scale reached clinical relevance in the 18-month cohort and 7 items and one scale in the 36-month cohort.ConclusionsTR is associated with significant regaining in QoL. A faster and significantly higher TR is seen in the shorter ADT schedule.
IntroductionThis study assessed the influence of intrapersonal (one’s own emotions) and interpersonal (emotions of others) emotional competence (EC) of informal caregivers on their quality of life (QoL) at the beginning of cancer care.MethodsParticipants completed two questionnaires assessing their intrapersonal and interpersonal EC (S-PEC) as well as their QoL (SF-36) at the beginning of treatments. Multivariate ANCOVA regression analyses were then performed to explore the influence of EC on QoL.ResultsThe questionnaires were completed by 203 caregivers. As expected, intrapersonal EC was associated with a better QoL in all sub-dimensions (p< 0.01). More surprisingly, interpersonal EC was associated with worse QoL in terms of physical role (− 8.97 [95% CI − 16.74; − 1.19]), emotional role (− 8.37 [95% CI − 16.27; − 0.48]), and general health (− 4.50 [95% CI − 8.08; − 0.92]).ConclusionIntrapersonal EC should be improved for better QoL of caregivers of cancer patients. However, the more caregivers are attentive to the emotions of others (e.g., by identifying, understanding, listening and helping to manage emotions), the more their physical and psychological state has an impact on their daily life and their perceived health is impaired.
PurposeSocial factors are associated with mental health and wellbeing. However, few studies have examined genetic and environmental influences on social factors themselves, limiting current understanding of influences on aspects of the social environment. Most studies which have identified links between social factors and mental health are also limited by the possible influence of unmeasured genetic and environmental confounding. In this study, we investigated the genetic and environmental underpinnings of multiple social factors (relationship satisfaction, loneliness, attachment, trust, relationship disruptions), and their associations with life satisfaction measured concurrently and six years later, after accounting for shared genetic and environmental confounding.MethodsData from a population-based sample of adult twins (N = 1987) and two measurement timepoints were used for the primary analyses. We used multivariate Cholesky models to estimate genetic and environmental influences across five social factors. Subsequently, we conducted co-twin control analyses to examine associations between social factors and wellbeing after controlling for shared genetic and environmental confounding.ResultsHeritability estimates for the social factors ranged from 24 to 42%. Genetic correlations across social factors were substantial, indicative of considerable genetic overlap. Associations between wellbeing and relationship satisfaction, loneliness, anxious and avoidant attachment, trust, and disruptions in relationships in the past year were attenuated in co-twin control analyses but remained statistically significant. Relationship satisfaction, loneliness, and attachment avoidance were also associated with wellbeing measured six years later in estimates which controlled for shared genetic and environmental confounding.ConclusionOur findings provide evidence that multiple social factors are associated with wellbeing after accounting for potential confounding by shared genetic and/or environmental factors. These findings highlight the importance of multiple aspects of the social environment for wellbeing in older adulthood. Future studies should examine the directionality in associations between social factors and mental health and assess these relationships beyond older adulthood.
Civil registration establishes legal identity for individuals and related government-issued identification document. Civil registration data are used to generate vital statistics which are an important source of data to policy-makers planning public policies and researchers studying population dynamics. However, many resource-poor countries lack a functioning civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system. Learning the factors that affect CRVS can help data users to better understand the context behind these data. The Government of Lao People’s Democratic Republic is in the process of conducting a social and behavior change communication (SBCC) campaign to improve civil registration. In preparation, a qualitative study was conducted to understand the residents’ knowledge, attitudes, practices, facilitating factors, and barriers regarding civil registration. One hundred seven key-informant interviews and 22 focus group discussions were conducted with government and nongovernmental organization employees, development partners, and residents employing semi-structured guides during July-December 2018. Data were analyzed using ATLAS.ti 23 applying the grounded theory and constant comparative analysis methods plus analytic memo writing. Findings show that barriers to civil registration include various costs involved in registering vital events, lack of awareness of civil registration, long distances to registration offices and poor road conditions, perceived lack of benefits, and long, complicated registration procedures. Respondents recommended the SBCC to inform the public about the legal mandate for and benefits of civil registration, and instruction on how to register vital events, using multiple channels, such as television, outreach visits to villages, posters, radio, village chiefs and loudspeakers, brochures, face-to-face meetings, social media, etc.
Do voters who dislike the other side prefer candidates who can win, even if they are less representative? Negative partisanship is an important feature of American politics, but few scholars have examined its relationship to voter decision-making. We argue that negative partisanship shapes how voters prioritize candidate electability and substantive representation. Using two conjoint experiments, we find that a primary candidate’s likelihood of beating the opposing party in the general election has a strong influence on whether they are chosen as a voter’s strategic choice (who they would vote for) and sincere choice (who best represents their interests). Importantly, the effect of electability is conditional on voters’ feelings toward the opposing party, but not their own party. Negative partisans are also more willing to trade greater ideological and policy representation for a better shot at electoral victory.

ObjectivesLow-income individuals facing criminal charges experience disproportionately high rates of pretrial detention and conviction. We study a pilot program in Santa Clara County, CA that aims to address this inequity by providing access to public defenders immediately following arrest.MethodsThe Santa Clara Public Defender agreed to provide pilot services one day per week, rotating the intervention day across weeks. Individuals booked on an intervention day were eligible for early legal representation, while individuals booked on control days received public defender services as usual. The study leverages the rotating treatment day to compare pretrial release and case outcomes between eligible individuals booked on treatment days and eligible individuals booked on control days.ResultsPilot program participants were 28 percentage points more likely to secure pretrial release, and 36 percentage points more likely to see their cases dismissed, relative to comparable individuals who generally first meet with their public defender at arraignment.ConclusionsProviding prompt access to legal representation could improve release and case outcomes for low-income individuals and the efficacy of public defense.
Egyptian emigration has been addressed as a singular incident, and it does not examine the possibility of returning to its home country or moving to another destination. Thus, more studies are needed to fill a gap in our knowledge of emigration from Egypt. Using a multistate life table approach, the study estimated the probability of emigration from Egypt according to destinations and the exact age of the emigrants, the probability of returning from the destination to the home country before reaching age 60, and the expected migration time in each destination; the study depended on data from the rich nationwide “The Egypt Household International Migration Survey.” Results confirm the pattern of migration from Egypt, which is acknowledged through previous studies, except that the driver of migration is no longer unemployment but rather in search of better conditions or a decent life. Also, the results indicate that Saudi Arabia attracted the largest percentage of working-age emigrants from Egypt, while Kuwait was the more stable destination. Libya is considered the least stable destination for Egyptian emigrants and the preferred country for young emigrants. Moreover, Saudi Arabia was the preferred destination for older Egyptians, followed by Kuwait. The probability of returning to Egypt increases significantly at 50-59 for all destination countries except Jordan. Finally, if an Egyptian emigrant wishes to move from their first destination, the next destination will be Saudi Arabia.
Little is known about the sources of parenting stress and the coping strategies adopted by parents of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in China. The current study aimed to explore the stress and coping strategies adopted by Chinese parents using stress-coping theories. A qualitative study was conducted on fifteen parents whose children, aged between 7 and 11 years (from primary school grades one to five), had received a formal diagnosis of ADHD. The findings revealed that Chinese parents use individual, family and school coping strategies to cope with their stress. The themes that emerged from the data included five types of stressors and eight coping strategies. The choice of the strategy adopted by the parents was influenced by cultural and environmental factors; in particular, family coping strategies required the availability of a supportive spouse and a supportive family culture. Similarly, school coping strategies required the availability of school involvement opportunities and school support resources. Since the support offered by teachers and mental health professionals such as school counsellors and social workers can be strengthened, this study recommends ways to strengthen the support provided to parents of children with ADHD.
The body of literature for a professional field is created by voices from people who share their ideas with others through scholarly writing. How do emerging scholars acquire the requisite academic writing skills to publish and contribute to publishing research in our profession? Mentorship is a time-honored practice that could be considered. One possible way to prepare people to amplify their voices through their scholarly writing is through mentorships. Writing mentorships, defined here as a productive collaboration between a more experienced academic author and an emergent scholar that results in professional publication, is the focus of this article. The authors will provide an overview of a specific mentorship program called, Division for Early Childhood Consortium for Innovations in Doctoral Excellence (DECIDE). The article concludes with strategies for generating more productive and satisfying mentor and mentee writing relationships with recommendations for future research.
Although quality early childhood education and care (ECEC) and strong collaborations between families and ECEC educators are important for all children, they may be particularly important for children and families who utilize nighttime or weekend ECEC. This study focuses on ECEC educators’ discourses about closeness versus distance in educational collaborations between parents with nonstandard schedules and professionals who work in extended hours ECEC. The data for this study were collected by interviewing ECEC teachers (n= 12) and nurses (n= 18) working in Finland.Research findings: Using the principles of discourse analysis, we found three tensional discourses: (a) the timing of ECEC and asynchrony; (b) a sense of time versus hurry; and (c) care versus criticism.Practice and policy: The findings revealed that extended hours ECEC provides both challenges and possibilities for creating close educational collaboration with parents. This has important implications for the kinds of structural supports and training educators in extended hours ECEC may need to foster quality collaboration with families.
The COVID-19 outbreak posed significant challenges for teachers by forcing them to move from face-to-face teaching to online teaching. Against this background, teachers’ beliefs about, and practices of, online teaching became particularly important because they might influence teachers’ teaching effectiveness and children’s learning. However, little is known about the factors affecting teachers’ beliefs about, and practices of, online teaching during COVID-19. This study examined the associations of psychological distress and professional identity with perceived value of online courses and perceived quality of online teaching among 127 Chinese preschool teachers during COVID-19. Results showed that depression and loneliness were negatively associated with perceived value of online courses and perceived quality of online teaching, respectively, while professional identity was positively associated with both. Our findings highlight the unique roles of psychological distress and professional identity in shaping preschool teachers’ beliefs about, and practices of, online teaching during COVID-19. Policymakers should establish effective policies and guidelines to protect preschool teachers’ mental well-being and help alleviate their psychological distress, particularly depression and loneliness, in times of unforeseen disasters such as the pandemic. School leaders and teacher training professionals should prioritize professional identity as a crucial part of preschool teachers’ professional development during the COVID-19 outbreak.
This study explores how institutional and managerial ownership influence the connection between executive directors’ pay and firm performance in South Africa. Employing panel linear regression models and Johnson-Neyman analysis, complex insights are revealed. This study revealed that institutional ownership acts as a double-edged sword, positively moderating the link between long-term and total incentive remuneration and Return on Assets (ROA), while negatively influencing the relationship with market-based metrics like Tobin’s Q. This suggests that institutional shareholders play a dual role in enhancing long-term alignment and tempering short-term performance pressures. Managerial ownership also demonstrates mixed impacts, positively moderating the relationship between both short-term and total incentive remuneration, and ROA, but negatively moderating the link between long-term incentive remuneration and Total Shareholder Return (TSR). These findings underscore the delicate balance between managerial incentives, shareholder interests, and long-term value creation. While higher managerial ownership aligns with short-term shareholder goals, it may also lead to managerial entrenchment and short-termism in certain contexts. This study contributes to literature on corporate governance and executive remuneration in an emerging market setting.. By revealing the nuanced effects of institutional and managerial ownership on the pay-performance relationship, the paper provides valuable insights for policymakers, investors and corporate leaders aiming to improve governance practices and foster sustainable value creation. Our study offers essential implications for corporate governance practices and sets the stage for further inquiry into the intricate relationship between ownership structure, executive compensation, and firm performance.
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in literary narratives from South Asia that confront the imaginative and representational challenges posed by the contemporary climate crisis. Drawing on insights from the emerging field of Critical Plant Studies, this paper reads recent Indian climate fiction for children from a “phyto-centric” perspective, analysing its representation of plants, and examining the ways in which literary encounters with botanical life can foster a sense of ethical responsibility. In Bijal Vachharajani’s recent young adult novel,Savi and the Memory Keeper(2021), the narrative characterizes trees as “mother trees”, “memory keepers”, and as signposts of climate change. This paper will examine how the narrative makes use of botanical tropes in reimagining environmental crises and activism on a scale relevant to young readers. In doing so, we also probe the ways in which botanical life in children’s environmental narratives perform an ecopedagogical function as trumpeters of the climate crisis.
Research on immigrant populations shows that child care choices are dependent on the population’s region of origin. While the Russian immigrant population in the United States comprises the largest group of immigrants from Eastern Europe and is likely to increase in the future, there is virtually no research on Russian immigrant families’ child care search and selection criteria. This qualitative study applies the theoretical model of Pungello and Kurtz-Costes (1999), which illustrates how factors such as parental demographic characteristics, environmental context, child characteristics, and parental beliefs play into families’ child care selection. The study draws from semi-structured interviews with 11 Russian immigrant families residing in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States to examine their child care search processes and selection criteria. Results revealed that most parents found child care through friends’ recommendations, Internet search, and online reviews. Nine themes describing child care criteria valued by Russian immigrant families emerged from the analysis. Specifically, parents mentioned culture and personal beliefs, child characteristics, convenience, cost and subsidy, education and learning, program features, facilities and environment, teacher characteristics, and rating and reputation as the major factors in selecting child care. Understanding Russian immigrant parents’ child care information sources and selection criteria will allow for early care and education (ECE) providers to accommodate the needs of Russian immigrant population and for policymakers to facilitate access to ECE programs for these families.
Can exposure to successful immigrants in the mass media affect perceptions of immigrants and alter attitudes toward immigration? To address this question, I study the case of Ozlem Tureci and Ugur Sahin, the co-developers of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and children of Turkish immigrants in Germany. I first demonstrate that German media favorably highlighted the Turkish roots and migration history of vaccine developers. Leveraging the quasi-experimental setting with the announcement of the success of the vaccine, I then posit that the wide broadcasting of the vaccine’s success and its developers’ identity should have positive spillover effects on public attitudes towards immigration. Amongst those who were exposed to this announcement, compared to those who were not, there is a 4 percentage-point increase in support of easing immigration opportunities. I suggest that this effect is driven by a change in perceptions and knowledge on issues relating to immigration and integration. These findings imply that promoting successful immigrants in the media has the potential to diminish prejudice; however, it is crucial to address varying biases toward different immigrant groups.
ObjectiveThis article studies how misreporting errors in crime surveys affect our understanding of the Dark Figure of Crime (DFC).MethodsThe paper adopts a Partial Identification framework which relies on assumptions that are weaker (and thus more credible) than those required by parametric models. Unlike common parametric models, Partial Identification handles both under-reporting and over-reporting of crimes (due to, say, stigma, memory errors or misunderstanding of upsetting events). We apply this framework to the Crime Survey for England and Wales to characterise the uncertainty surrounding crimes by severity and geographic region.ResultsDepending on the assumptions considered, the partial identification regions for the DFC vary from [0.000, 0.774] to [0.351, 0.411]. A credible estimate places the true DFC in [0.31, 0.51]. This range was obtained while allowing for a substantive amount of reporting error (25%) and assuming that people do not over-report crimes in surveys (saying they are a victim of crime erroneously or falsely). Across regions, uncertainty is larger in the north of England.ConclusionAccounting for misreporting introduces uncertainty about the actual magnitude of the DFC. This uncertainty is contingent on the unknown proportion of misreported crimes in the survey. When this proportion is modest (10% or below), raw survey estimates offer valuable insights, albeit with lingering uncertainty. However, researchers may want to opt for Partial Identification regions based on larger misreported proportions when examining relatively infrequent crimes that carry substantial stigma, such as sexual crimes or domestic violence. The width of the partial identification regions in this paper fluctuates among different regions of England and Wales, indicating varying levels of uncertainty surrounding the DFC in distinct localities. Consequently, previous research relying on parametric assumptions and resulting in singular point estimates necessitates re-evaluation in light of the findings presented herein.
As more laws emerge in the EU’s member states that regulate lobbying, this growing trend also warrants a closer look at how lobbying regulation at EU level has evolved, not least since some of the new lobbying registers have looked to the EU’s system for inspiration. The European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission signed an inter-institutional agreement on a mandatory transparency register on 20 May 2021 (OJ L 207, 11.6.2021, p. 1–17) with an accompanying political statement (OJ L 207, 11.6.2021, p. 18–18), effectively making prior registration a condition for certain interest representation activities. Since the Parliament and the Commission first joined forces in their efforts to shed light on interest representation, advocacy and all other types of lobbying in 2011, their goal has not changed fundamentally. However, the appetite for transparent decision-making and accountability both on the side of the decision-makers and on the public scrutiny side has grown alongside wider efforts to ensure the resilience of democratic structures and processes in uncertain times. In this context, this paper examines what the EU institutions’ transparency register can and cannot do, how the EU’s institutions achieve compliance with their carrot and stick approach and how the new conditionality principle introduced in 2021 makes registration de facto mandatory for interest representatives seeking to influence policy and decision-making of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
Growing up in socioeconomic disadvantage is a consistent predictor of poor mental health. Although research has largely focused on objective socioeconomic position, studies exploring howsubjectivesocial status confers risk for psychopathology have consistently found that youth with lower subjective social status are at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their higher subjective social status peers, regardless of the objective socioeconomic environment. Yet, it remains relatively unknown how subjective social status relates to objective socioeconomic measures and to mental health in marginalized groups. The current study tested whether subjective social status predicts mental health above and beyond objective socioeconomic indicators in a community-based sample of Black adolescents living in poverty (N= 270;Mage= 16.32). Perhaps surprisingly, the majority of mental health outcomes analyzed were not significantly associated with either objective or subjective socioeconomic measures. Cultural, contextual, and racial considerations should be considered in future research on subjective social status and adolescent mental health.
This study assesses trends in regular (i.e., at least weekly) sports participation among people aged 55 + in the Netherlands. It also examines later-life sports participation differences between native Dutch people and their counterparts in four groups with a non-Western migration background (Turkish; Moroccan; Surinamese; Dutch Caribbean), and on how such differences developed between 2003 and 2020. Logistic regression analyses of population-based repeated cross-sectional survey data (n =4,362) showed that regular later-life sports participation increased substantially between 2003 and 2020. Older people in all migrant groups considered were less likely than native Dutch people to participate in sports regularly. KHB decomposition analyses indicated that the rise in later-life sports participation between 2003 and 2020 and the lower sports participation rates of people of Turkish and Moroccan origin could partly be attributed to differences over time and between groups in educational attainment. Models with interaction terms were furthermore estimated to assess how ethnic differences in sports participation developed over the observed period. These models showed that the sports participation gap between people of Moroccan origin and native Dutch people became smaller between 2003 and 2020. Nevertheless, native Dutch people remained the group most likely to participate in sports regularly.
IntroductionMalnutrition in early childhood has long-term health consequences, including increased obesity risk due to catch-up growth in undernourished infants. While maternal perceptions and feeding practices affect infant malnutrition, limited evidence exists in middle-income countries like Mexico. This study examines the associations between maternal perceptions, feeding practices, and nutritional status in infants aged 6–12 months in northeastern Mexico.MethodsA total of 192 mother-infant dyads were assed using questionnaires and anthropometric measurements. Maternal variables included perception of hunger and satiety, infant weight perception, feeding attitudes, self-efficacy, fatigue, and feeding practices. Infant nutritional status was determined using WHO Anthro, and multiple logistic regression identified associations between maternal and infant factors and nutritional status.Results38% of infants were overweight/obese, and 7% were underweight. Low maternal self-efficacy, low perception of hunger and satiety signs, non-recommended feeding attitudes, and inaccurate perception of infant weight were identified. Maternal nocturnal sleep hours, type of feeding, and feeding frequency were associated to underweight. The maternal perception of infant weight was inaccurate for both underweight (mothers overestimate the weight) and overweight/obese (mothers underestimate the weight) infants.DiscussionThe main maternal perception influencing infant nutritional status was inaccurate weight perception. Mothers demonstrated limited knowledge and negative feeding practices with non-recommended feeding practices among Mexican mothers. Longer maternal sleep duration (> 8 h/night) was associated with underweight infants.
Previous cross-sectional research has found large cross-country differences in crime-related feelings of insecurity associated not with crime rates but with welfare state policies reflecting that fear of crime serves as an expression of generalized social insecurities. The financial crisis plunged European societies into a period of severe socio-economic insecurities. Against this backdrop, I use hybrid multilevel models to test hypotheses if changes in socio-economic conditions and social policies – in particular following the 2008 financial crisis – have affected feelings of insecurity in 27 European countries, using nine rounds of the European Social Survey. Most indicators except the homicide rate did not show significant effects on fear of crime in the longitudinal dimension. The consequences of the financial crisis for people’s well-being did not extend to fear of crime. Social expenditures in-kind for families and children showed the strongest association with fear of crime cross-sectionally but may lack the necessary country-level variation over time to produce significant effects. Mirroring research on generalized trust, fear of crime seems relatively stable over time and deeply associated with welfare state institutions.
Climate change is a fundamentally a call for human change. What is being asked of us as pastoral practitioners in this new situation? This article reflects on this question through the lens of listening. Traditionally, we have listened primarily to otherhumans and/or the voice of the transcendent mediated throughhumanchannels. But these are not the only voices. Other-than-human voices—wind, water, fire, atmosphere, and non-human creatures—are now making their presences urgently felt. Earth herself is crying out. In response to this challenge, we attempted to re-imagine a traditional program of pastoral formation known as clinical pastoral education (CPE). To begin to listen to Earth’s voice involves a radical turning, a change of worldview and practices of attention. Reflection on a classic text (or theological reflection), a core component of the CPE process, played a critical role. In this article we listen to the classic wisdom text of the book of Job, particularly the astonishing speech of YHWH in chapters 38–39; provide an overview of the structural changes developed in CPE programs in eco-ministry; and trace the journey of one intern within one of these programs. This example shows the transformative outcomes that can occur when the core of pastoral care, empathic listening, is extended to the more-than-human world.
This study addresses the paucity of research concerning the elimination of development gaps and fairness issues in the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the sub-national level. Drawing upon China’s provinces as cases, we compute the China Provincial Sustainable Development Goal Index (CPSDGI), comprising one total SDG index and 14 individual SDG indices, and employ an array of quantitative methods, including the Theil index, SDG dashboard, linear regression, and spatial autocorrelation analysis, to scrutinize inter-provincial disparities and frontier issues. Our results indicate the following: (1) Despite some reduction in disparities among the three regions in China, overall provincial discrepancies have not undergone significant amelioration, with each province exhibiting persistent vulnerabilities across various SDGs; (2) while economic development imbalances have been alleviated, disparities in public services have become more salient and onerous to address; (3) notably, gender equality gaps are more arduous to narrow than those in economic equality; and (4) most significantly, SDG9 manifests the most uneven development and necessitates greater attention with respect to both time and space. The study carries implications for SDG localization and emphasizes the crucial imperative of the SDG principle of ‘no one left behind’.
Informed by models of resilience in military families, we explored factors theorized to be associated with social-emotional resilience and risk among young military-connected children. Our secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from 199 military-connected families (n= 346 parents) with at least one preschool-age child in the home (n= 199) led to the empirical identification of two distinct clusters: families with children demonstrating healthy social-emotional functioning and those showing indicators of less healthy social-emotional functioning when compared to the first group. We then identified factors associated with membership in each cluster to determine which deployment and parental well-being variables were salient for young child adjustment. Parent psychological symptoms, parenting, child behavior, and parent-child relationships were measured by parent report and observed interaction. Children with healthier social-emotional functioning were found to be residing with families experiencing less stress and distress. The importance of maternal trauma history is highlighted in our study, as elevated maternal symptoms across all three posttraumatic stress disorder symptom domains were associated with child social-emotional risk. Basic family demographic characteristics did not contribute significantly to the cluster distinctions, nor did military service factors such as active duty, reserve or veteran status, military rank or parent deployment history. These findings are important as the results deemphasize the importance of military service characteristics and highlight the importance of parent well-being when considering social-emotional risk and resilience of young children within military families.
While parental violent disciplining of children is a global concern, children living in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh are particularly more vulnerable to harsh disciplinary practices at home. There is limited empirical evidence on the use of disciplinary practices in Bangladesh, impeding the development of prevention practices. This study investigated the extent of violent child disciplining and parental attitudes toward physical punishment and identified their predictor using data from the 2019 Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey. Violent discipline includes any form of physical punishment like spanking, slapping, or hitting any part of the body, as well as psychological aggression such as shouting, screaming, or name-calling. Study participants were 44,570 mothers/caregivers of children aged 2–14 years. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models were fitted to identify the predictors of violent disciplinary practices and parents’ attitudes toward physical punishment. The results revealed a very high prevalence of violent disciplinary practices in Bangladesh. About 89% of the mothers/caregivers reported using at least one form of violent discipline; 39% were spanked, hit, or slapped on the bottom, 29% were hit or slapped on the face, head, or ears, and 5% were beaten up as hard as one could. Younger children, and children from urban areas, certain administrative divisions, poorer families, children with functional difficulties, less educated mothers/caregivers were more likely to experience violent discipline. About 35% of mothers/caregivers supported physical punishment, indicating a large discrepancy between attitude and the practice of violent discipline. Parents’ attitudes appeared as one of the strongest predictors of violent discipline. Prevention efforts should be made to promote positive parenting and minimize the gap between parental attitudes and the practice of physical punishment.
Given recent public suicides of pastors and the devastation felt by congregations, it is important to investigate what might contribute to pastors’ intent to die by suicide. For the current study, 158 pastors-in-training completed a survey on intent to die by suicide and possible correlates. They also reported on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their religious life. Two-thirds (66.4%) of the participants reported suicidal ideation and/or at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime. Stepwise regression analysis of suicidal behaviors and correlating factors shows that perceived burdensomeness in interpersonal relationships, emotional support given to church members, and fear of suicide increase suicidal behaviors. Religious service attendance and child-related concerns reduce suicidal behaviors. The COVID-19 pandemic had negative impacts on participants’ relationship with God and connection with their faith community. The negative impact of the pandemic on relationship with God correlates with increased suicidal ideation in the first year of the pandemic. Practical implications of these findings for helping pastors hurting in ministry are discussed.
ObjectivesThe analytic workhorse of modern sentencing research is the multi-level model—which gives more “empirical voice” to statistics coming from larger clusters. While an overall cluster balancing adjustment is certainly needed, it does not correct for subgroup unbalancing—a material issue in the federal system where a few districts contribute an outsized number of minority defendants (i.e., the problem of uneven contribution). The goal of this study is to demonstrate how heavy saturation of racial/ethnic minority defendants in a select few districts obscures the generalizability of system-wide, multi-level, statistics.MethodsTo provide a more holistic understanding of the system-wide effects generated by the multi-level model, the current study supplies descriptive and multivariate analyses of racial/ethnic differences in federal sentencing outcomes ranging 2018 to 2021.ResultsOur main finding is that although the multi-level regression coefficient shows Hispanic federal defendants receivelongersentences than Whites (net of controls), most Hispanic federal defendants are sentenced in areas where they can expect to receiveshortersentences than Whites (net of controls). This seemingly incompatible finding exists for Black-White comparisons too—but to a lesser extent.ConclusionsA racially/ethnically clustered federal court system, an overall cluster size adjustment, and heterogenous statistical conclusion validity across districts, coalesce to deliver system-wide racial/ethnic effects reflecting the social world of the few. Seeing as people are sentenced, not places, the outsized voice of low minority contribution districts produces a misunderstanding of the scope and nature of racial/ethnic differences in sentencing.
In this paper, we investigate the validity of objective operator data as proxy indicators for riskier gambling as based upon an independent self-report measure. Such work is important to strengthen the validity of gambling research involving objective behavioral indicators of harm used to detect higher risk gambling or product choices. To address these aims, a total of 21,464 individual customers from a single international operator completed the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). These data were then mapped to measures of player gambling activity and a range of objective behavioural markers of harm. The results confirmed that people scoring 8 + on the PGSI were found to have higher levels of gambling involvement (participation, days active and expenditure) on a range of gambling products, with differences generally larger for casino than wagering activities. Importantly, this group was also more likely to have a higher incidence of behavioural markers of harm (e.g., declined deposits). The data allowed for the replication of a previous study using such markers to detect differences in product risk, but further validated their use in a variety of analytical contexts by showing a concordance between self-reported and objective risk measures.
In 1977, Michael Lipton introduced the Urban Bias Thesis as a framework for understanding how most economic policy initiatives have contributed to the overdevelopment of urban areas and the underdevelopment of rural areas. In Latin America, there has historically been a positive correlation between urbanization and mortality decline, as the region’s health transition generally began in the main cities and tended to proceed more rapidly in countries with higher levels of urbanization. This paper seeks evidence of a residual urban bias in the region’s mortality patterns. Using a sample of Latin American countries over the 2000–2010 period, I analyse the disparities in mortality patterns and avoidable causes of death by looking closely at urban and rural areas using continuum categories. The results indicate that the urban advantage does persist and that rural–urban mortality differentials have consistently favoured the largest cities. The metropolitan advantage in mortality is an outcome of lower mortality in causes of death that are avoidable through primary interventions. Even in scenarios of high mortality at younger adult ages (15–44), the metropolitan advantage remains, due primarily to unsuccessful efforts to reduce mortality in populations aged 45 years and over outside the main and large cities.
Considering the high prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) against women in Nigeria and the dire health implications, this study assessed the multilevel factors associated with the severity of IPV (SIPV) among ever-partnered women (i.e., ever-married or cohabited) in Nigeria. The 2018 Nigeria Demographic Health Survey (712 women) was analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple ordinal logistic regression. Results show that 19.7%, 17.7%, and 62.6% of women experienced more severe, less severe, and no severe IPV, respectively. At the individual level, the odds of more severe IPV (MSIPV) were higher among women whose male partners drank alcohol (compared to those whose male partners did not). At the household/ relationship level, the odds were lower among childless women (than non-childless women with male children). The odds of MSIPV were higher for those exposed to interparental violence (than the unexposed) and as the male partner’s control score increased. Male partner’s dominance in household decisions was negatively associated with more severe IPV. At the community level, the odds of MSIPV were lower for women in communities with high support for wife-beating (than communities with low support). Compared to the North-Central region, the likelihood of MSIPV was greater among women in the North-East. This finding may help interventions for protecting and preventing women from experiencing IPV in Nigeria.
Preventing adolescents from engaging in Health-Risk Behaviours (HRBs) requires a comprehensive understanding of the factors linked to HRBs. Factors like dysfunctional parenting practices and emotion regulation difficulties may significantly contribute to the development and persistence of HRBs. However, this association, particularly the mediating effects of emotion-regulation difficulties, has not been extensively investigated among Indian adolescents, as such research has predominantly centred around Western cultures. The current study explored emotion-regulation difficulties as a mediator in the association between perceived parenting practices and HRBs. The sample comprises 723 adolescents (Mage= 16.05; Males = 440) selected from various schools in the Punjab state of India. Structural equation modelling using item-parcels and the path analysis tested the stated hypotheses. As hypothesized, difficulties in emotion regulation were found to be a partial mediator of the parenting-HRB relationship. By offering empirical evidence of this mediational mechanism, the study enhances our understanding of how perceived parenting influences adolescent behaviour. Emotion dysregulation may be the underlying factor behind the development and maintenance of HRBs. These insights can guide researchers in designing targeted interventions to address emotion regulation difficulties and, in turn, help reduce HRBs among adolescents.
PurposeTo provide further evidence on the psychometric properties of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy–Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) in moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD), and to determine thresholds for meaningful improvement in fatigue.MethodsThe FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item patient-reported outcome measure (range, 0–52) assessing fatigue over the previous week. Using pooled data from the Phase 3 VIVID-1 study of moderately to severely active CD, psychometric properties of FACIT-Fatigue were evaluated up to Week 52. The Patient Global Rating of Severity (PGRS) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) were used as primary anchors to estimate the FACIT-Fatigue score change representing meaningful improvement.ResultsPsychometric analyses included 1065 adults. The FACIT-Fatigue demonstrated good internal consistency, and correlations between individual items and the total score were moderate to strong. The FACIT-Fatigue score showed moderate to strong correlations with other patient-reported assessments and weak correlations with endoscopic/laboratory assessments. The FACIT-Fatigue differentiated between distinct groups of participants varying in disease severity, quality of life, and fatigue based on PGRS and other assessments. FACIT-Fatigue improvements during the study differed significantly between most PGRS change and PGIC categories. Anchor-based estimates suggested a 6–9-point increase in the FACIT-Fatigue total score as meaningful improvement.ConclusionsThe FACIT-Fatigue demonstrated strong psychometric properties in the VIVID-1 population of adults with moderately to severely active CD and determined a FACIT-Fatigue score change threshold representing meaningful improvement.Trial registrationNCT03926130.

This paper analyses the regulatory context, i.e., how IFRS preparers investing in Poland react to banning IFRS use by domestic firms in the alternative trading market (NewConnect) after six years of regulatory arbitrage. In other words, it studies their portfolio investment and foreign direct investment (FDI) outward sensitivity to the end of regulatory arbitrage opportunity given by the alternative market’s regulation in the country where accounting law limits IFRS use to regulated markets and business groups where the parent company uses IFRS. The contribution is built on the natural experiment of prohibition of domestic IFRS preparers issuing shares on the alternative (not-regulated and cheaper) trading market after 2012. The originality is delivered by implementing a de facto measure of IFRS adoption by foreign investors to identify a 69% growth rate of IFRS preparers investing in Polish firms in 2012 (317% growth of Swedish investors and 219% of Portuguese) that dropped to 8% in 2013 and 3% in 2018. Thus, we check whether investing decisions consider opportunities to gain funds or attract other investors and build trust through IPOs on the unregulated market dedicated to start-ups and engaged in R&D activity. We use difference-in-differences, GMM dynamic panel-data analysis with Arellano-Bond and Arellano-Bover/Blundel-Bond estimators for the Knowledge-Capital model on portfolio investment, outward FDI overall, and three FDI components based on debt, equity, and earning reinvestment in 2003–2019. We found that banning IFRS use by domestic firms in the alternative market discourages portfolio investments, debt-based FDI flows and FDI earnings reinvestment. Also, total FDI and equity-based FDI from countries with more IFRS preparers have been reduced since 2013 due to the IFRS ban for domestic firms.
Following the “bellicist” school of state formation, the external threat of war is expected to spur polity formation by centralizing military capacity (Tilly, in Coercion, Capital, and European States, Oxford, Basil Blackwell, 1990). It has been argued that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could provide such an impetus for centralization in the EU polity (Kelemen & McNamara, Comparative Political Studies, 55(6):18–34, 2022). We adapt the Tillian argument to the era of mass democracy, where governments need citizen support. Public support is crucial because it can constrain governments in times of crisis, especially regarding salient policies. We do not yet understand what degree of centralization the European public supports and under which conditions it can increase. We conduct an experiment where we vary both the Russian (escalation from presence in Ukraine to the invasion of Moldova or Lithuania) and the American responses (continuation of support vs. withdrawal) and see how European preferences vary for polity building in defense. We field our experiment in 7 countries (Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, Finland, Poland, and Hungary) with different sensitivities and exposures to the war in Ukraine. We propose an alternative argument to the Tillian approach based on the seminal Milwardian argument according to which polity coordination of national capacities is preferred (Milward, in The European Rescue of the Nation State, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1992). We show theoretically and empirically that external threats can actually hamper polity centralization, at least in the short term. Rather, they strengthen the subunits of a polity through coordination.
While recent years have seen a substantial increase in research on clientelism, nearly all of it pertains to clientelism as an electoral strategy. This paper offers a general stocktaking of our understanding of the key issues in how clientelism arises, performs and (perhaps) diminishes, drawing on electoral studies while recognizing that findings in this realm do not always generalize to others. The specific questions addressed are: (1) What are the commonalities between electoral and non-electoral clientelism, and in what respects is the former distinctive? (2) What is the salience of the “commitment problem”—uncertainty over the future performance of clientelist offers—in both electoral clientelism and clientelism in general? (3) Given that clientelism entails exchanges over status inequalities, what is its relevance for studies of prosocial and dominant/submissive behaviors, and vice versa? (4) How should we view the relationship between the extent of clientelist practices in a given society and its degree of social, political and economic development or institutionalization? (5) Does clientelism require voluntary participation, or can it accommodate aspects of coercion? (6) How should clientelism be viewed normatively according to commonly applied criteria? The paper concludes with a few issues that deserve greater attention in future research.
PurposeMany people living with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experience poor sleep, which is associated with diminished overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We quantified associations between sleep quality and HRQoL domains and examined the extent to which other MS symptoms could account for these associations.MethodsIn this cross-sectional survey of 1,717 Australians with MS, we used Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) 8D and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess HRQoL and sleep quality, respectively. Total, direct, and indirect effects of sleep quality on HRQoL domains were determined using mediation regression analysis.ResultsPoor sleep quality was significantly associated with all domains of HRQoL, with strongest associations seen for mental health (β=-0.08) and pain (β=-0.11), and weaker associations for independent living (β=-0.05) and senses (β=-0.03). Poor sleep quality had the largest direct effect on mental health (60.8%), happiness (48.7%), and pain (49.7%). MS symptom clusters mostly contributing to indirect effects were “feelings of anxiety and depression” for psychosocial, and “pain and sensory symptoms” for physical HRQoL super dimensions.ConclusionImproving sleep could lead to substantial improvements in all HRQoL domains and the improvement in HRQoL could be partially achieved through indirect improvements in sleep on MS symptoms.
As early as preschool, Black children are more at risk than their peers to receive exclusionary practices. These negative early childhood school experiences can create greater risk for entrance into the preschool-to-prison pipeline. However, familial protective factors can help reduce exposure and mitigate this systemic pipeline for young children. The purpose of this study was to determine the familial factors associated with reducing a child’s entrance into the preschool-to-prison pipeline. Results from this study indicated that there were differences in perspectives among teachers and families regarding their child’s academic and behavioral risk. The findings also suggest that consistent strategies and collaboration among teachers and families can serve as familial protective factors, potentially mitigating the risk of academic failures and behavioral disorders.
Emerging research has highlighted potential associations between micro-transaction use and problematic videogame and gambling behaviour. An increasingly prominent theory highlights that self-determined motivations and basic psychological needs may play crucial roles in the development of problematic videogame and gambling behaviour. However, literature discussing the role that micro-transaction use has in this relationship is scarce. The present study examined the role of micro-transactions in the relationship between self-determined motivations for gaming and gambling and problematic behaviour (internet gaming disorder and problem gambling severity). A sample of 370 participants (74.1% male,Mage= 28.24 years,SD= 7.88) answered questions related to their gaming and gambling motivations, basic psychological needs, micro-transaction use (i.e., type of micro-transaction, expenditure, and frequency of use), internet gaming disorder, and problem gambling. The present study used structural equation modelling methods to test relationships between these variables. The results indicated positive associations between extrinsic gaming and gambling motivations and frequency of micro-transaction use. Frequency of micro-transaction use (i) partially mediated the relationship between extrinsic gambling motivations and problem gambling severity, and (ii) fully mediated the relationship between externally regulated gaming motivations and problem gambling severity. Expenditure on micro-transactions and basic psychological needs were not found to be significant variables in the present study. Potential explanations for the findings, including a lack of self-esteem and a need to boost ego, social pressure, and rapid reward processes, are discussed. The implications and applications of the research are also discussed, focusing on limit setting and policy development focusing on frequency of micro-transaction use.
Depression in adolescents is detrimental to their quality of life and wellbeing. Previous research has found that childhood psychological maltreatment (CPM) is positively associated with adolescents’ depressive symptoms. However, little is known about the relationship between parental CPM and depressive symptoms in their offspring. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the relationship between parental CPM and offspring depressive symptoms, as well as the possible mediating variables in this relationship. The present study recruited 315 Chinese high school students (Mage= 17.27, SDage= 0.80, 137 boys) and their parents to complete the Child Psychological Maltreatment Scale and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. The results revealed that parental CPM was related to both offspring psychological maltreatment and parental depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we found that the relationship between parental CPM and offspring depressive symptoms was mediated by parental depressive symptoms and offspring psychological maltreatment. These findings suggest that parents with a history of psychological maltreatment were related to increased adolescent depressive symptoms through the exposure of the next generation to CPM. These results have some implications for parents and adolescents in terms of intervention approaches to treat CPM and depressive symptoms, which could further promote health and wellbeing.
Scalable light-touch programs that align with the Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) approach is becoming an established intervention model for refugee youth with symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Teaching Recovery Techniques (TRT) is one example and, as TF-CBT guidelines state, parent sessions are included as the model relies on parents to provide support and instigate the techniques. In addition to traumatic stress, refugee families are often subjected to acculturative, isolation and resettlement stress. This study sought to understand how refugee parental involvement in TRT functions in practice and how it is perceived by participating youth, parents, and facilitators in Sweden. Thirty semi-structured interviews (11 youth, 8 parents, and 11 TRT facilitators) were conducted by phone or videoconference, transcribed, and analyzed using Thematic Network Analysis. A global theme ‘Parental engagement in trauma recovery requires dedicated attention’ emerged. Three organizing themes sat within this global theme: (i) Shifting roles when adapting differently to a new context; (ii) Tendency to keep parents at a distance; and (iii) Parent sessions don’t just happen. Whilst the potential for refugee parent involvement was recognized, a number of factors preventing their participation were identified. Cultural adaptations within TRT facilitators’ training are recommended, including: raising awareness about contextual factors and changes in family dynamics with regard to trauma and migration; adopting culturally responsive ways to present parental involvement to youth and parents; adding positive parenting skills; addressing parental mental health and readiness; and preparing facilitators to redirect parents to adequate services, when needed.
Black older adults (65 +) represent 24% of all nursing home (NH) residents in the USA, and 20.2% of Black NH residents have Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease–related dementias (AD/ADRD). Despite their growing presence, when compared to their White counterparts, Black older adults experience worse health outcomes and are more likely to reside in lower-quality NHs, a direct byproduct of systemic racism. To cope with the stress of inadequate care delivery, many Black residents rely on external social support networks. Little research to date has explored how external social support is or can be, leveraged by Black residents for improved care delivery. Drawing on the minority stress model, we applied thematic analysis to three focus group transcripts (n= 22) conducted with Black AD/ADRD caregivers in Minnesota. We found that resident social support networks overwhelmingly adopted a “support through advocacy” mentality. Although these efforts are grounded in the care of their friends or family, advocacy behaviors often extended to other NH residents who self-identified as lacking social support. Given the disproportionate share of Black residents with AD/ADRD living in institutional-based long-term care settings, understanding both formal and informal care delivery practices, especially the role of Black resilience, is essential to delivering high-quality care.
Lynching became a popular part of the lexicon in India during the last decade, and the word is used to communicate incidents where a group of people takes justice into their own hands. Considering the violent nature of lynching, it became a topic of intense debate. Yet, there is a lack of definitional clarity, and the ambit of lynching has been stretched to signify various forms of violence. Even the modest number of scholarly research projects takes the term “lynching” for granted. Considering the ambiguity surrounding it, this study analyzes and articulates the phenomena of lynchings in India, particularly during the period 2000–2021 while undertaking a genealogical study to illustrate the history, and the meaning of the word and how it has evolved over the years alongside the associated phenomena. To do so is to take away the misleading objectivity the word can sometimes generate. Following the conceptualization of lynchings and its changing expression in different societies, particularly the United States of America, the article highlights in what ways the definition and content of lynching have become more symbolically charged and the reasons for the change as well as what made lynching an extraordinary form of violence.
How can we work with diverse cultures and diverse ways of knowing whilst enabling space for diversity? Metalogues can help to avoid (or remedy) misunderstanding, leaving ideas out,speaking fororover others. It provides breathing space between the stimulus of engagement and the process of coming up with an agreed upon output or outcome. This postcolonial and non-anthropocentric approach is rooted in collegiality and a recognition of our hybridity and interconnectedness with many species; as such it celebrates ‘entangled life’ (Sheldrake2021) with Indigenous and non Indigenous academics, leaders and community practitioners, including farmers. The paper discusses the dynamic process. Could this process be considered multispecies neuroscience in action?
Drawing on a mixed-methods evaluation of the New Teacher Induction Programme of the South African Department of Basic Education, this paper examines the role of Professional Learning Communities in enabling the transition of newly qualified teachers (NQTs) into their professional roles in schools. The article focuses on one of the four components of the induction programme, namely, the participation of NQTs in Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) and examines the experiences of newly qualified teachers as members of their respective professional learning communities. It begins by examining the range of typical early career challenges and, thereafter, shows how the social capital fostered through their collaboration in communities enables  to overcome a range of challenges they face. As the results of the study show, PLCs provide safe spaces where new teachers experiment, share experiences and engage in collective reflection and problem-solving. The new teachers reported a range of professional and personal benefits, including their professional growth, expanded peer networks, and a stronger sense of belonging. Moreover, their responses show how their participation in PLCs contributes to developing their self- and collective efficacy, increasing their resilience, and enabling their transition into the teaching profession. As a participatory action research study, the paper shows the dual benefits of the PLCs – both in supporting the personal and professional development of novice teachers and in informing the development of broader educational policy. The results of the study led to the expansion of the New Teacher Induction Programme and the national adoption of PLCs – illustrating how teacher experiences can inform policy in bringing about meaningful change.
This quantitative study was designed to examine whether the visual information provided by extra-facial elements (i.e., human bodies and contextual surroundings) affects emotion-identification accuracy among young adults with an autism spectrum disorder. Participants were 15 young adults with autism spectrum disorder (Mage= 19.47) and 15 neurotypical young adults (Mage= 19.73), who identified emotions (fear, anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, surprise) from photographs. Author-developed stimuli were used, which included head-only, whole-body-only, and whole-body-in-a-context (e.g., a person in a store) visuals. Participants viewed the images and verbally identified the emotions. Findings showed that emotion-recognition accuracy among young adults with autism increased when identifying emotions from whole-body-in-a-context images compared to their performances on the head-only or whole-body-only visuals. Young adults with autism were also less accurate than neurotypical young adults on head-only and whole-body-only visuals, but no significant differences were found between groups when identifying emotions from whole-body-in-a-context visuals. Neurotypical participants showed no significant changes across visuals. These findings indicate that young adults with autism may rely on visual information, such as bodily and contextual cues, to accurately identify emotions, which has ramifications for this group’s ability to recognize emotions in real-world situations and may inform future evaluations and interventions.
The history and evolution of Sociology in Italy have a particular path which, from the second post-war period onwards, has as its objective the task of promoting the growth of the country's social culture, i.e. strengthening the connection between social science, scientific knowledge, culture, and daily life. Between difficulties and enthusiasm, the discipline faced significant changes towards modernization that also crossed Italy in the same period: the territory, the productive activities, the national life, the lifestyles of the Italians, and their consumption changed. Since the 1960s onwards, Sociology has taken its place in the country's daily life as a "cultural form of a wider culture" even though it did not represent a hegemonic discipline in the Italian panorama. In the same years, the development of the Italian cultural industry and the evolution of the culture market undergo a strong acceleration, assuming a central role in the social life of Italians and a guiding function in the elaboration of the collective imagination. In this context, the contribution intends to focus attention on the cultural studies that have developed at a national level following two main areas of development: 1) the emergence of the media and 2) the multiple nature of cultural products and material culture in the Italian scenario from the economic boom to nowadays.
Despite the growing interest in the migration of older adults in China, the intricacies linking migration motivations with destination choices remain insufficiently explored. Drawing from China’s unique context, we categorize inter-provincial older migrants into three types: employment-led, dependent, and lifestyle. Using microdata from the Sixth Population Census of 2010 and the 1% Population Sampling Survey of 2015, we examine their evolving motivations and corresponding shifts in destination preferences. The analysis shows an increase in lifestyle-oriented migration and a decrease in dependent migration, while employment-led migration has remained stable relative to the total. Older migrants seeking employment tend to favor destinations further south, prioritizing regional economic conditions. In contrast, those motivated by lifestyle factors exhibit a broader range of destination choices, largely due to their preference for amenities. Dependent older adult migrants consider both job-related and amenity-related factors and demonstrate a stronger tendency to relocate to the east. Amenity-related factors have increasingly influenced the destination choices across all three types of migration over time. Our findings provide deeper insights into the intricacies of migration in old adulthood and highlight the need for tailored policymaking.
Despite its importance for the social sciences,human agencyremains an ambiguous and underoperationalized construct. After engaging prior research to articulate clear criteria for defining agency and synthesize a multidimensional conceptual framework for human agency, this study develops and validates preliminary General Human Agency Indicators (GHAIs) to measure subconstructs within that framework. Utilizing the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) dataset, we aggregated a list of 30 survey items previously used in agency research and conducted an iterative process of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and item elimination to reduce that list to a set of 9–13 items with a strong, consistent factorial structure. Using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), we identified two bifactor models that demonstrated good fit: a nine-item General Personal Agency scale (GPAS) and a nine-item GHAIs tool combining six items from the GPAS with three measuring agency achievement. Initial evidence for the construct validity of the tools was produced through tests of internal consistency and correlational analysis, indicating that the proposed GPAS and GHAIs effectively measure personal agency, intrinsic agency, instrumental agency, and agency achievement.
This paper aims to provide the basis for a conceptual framework on the linkage that integrates the application areas of blockchains in the public sector and their impact dimensions. Applying the literature review methodology, 33 selected articles were explored in-depth to identify their thematic key points, which led to their attribution to two categories consistent with the RQs of this work: application areas and impact dimensions of the blockchain technology in the public sector organizations. The results enable the identification of a cross-functionality of the impact dimensions (trust, governance, and sustainability) that cut across the main application areas (public health, transactions and fiscal processes, and policy-making), from which derives the basis for a conceptual framework. The conceptual framework links the application areas and impacts of blockchain in the public sector and leads to some concluding remarks on managerial/policy implications and future research opportunities.
Smuggling industry plays a key role in the international migratory processes; it is a world-wide and often misunderstood phenomenon which operates in a multiplicity of spaces and at different stages: at the beginning of the ‘journey’ and along the route, when migrants need to rely on supporting networks to cross borders and continue their journey. This industry also operates in a concatenation of loops involving different actors, which include migrants who pilot the small boats transporting migrants across the sea. Although these migrants are not formally affiliated with the smuggling organizations, they find themselves unwittingly drawn into the activity, compelled to operate the boats ferrying migrants at sea and consequently facing criminalization processes. Focusing on the Eastern and Central Mediterranean Sea routes and drawing insights from 22 in-depth qualitative interviews with key informants based in Greece and Sicily, this paper seeks to enrich the existing body of knowledge concerning border securitization and the intersection of immigration control with criminal justice, often referred to as 'crimmigration'. The merging of criminal law and migration law prompts an inquiry into whether the prosecution of people who steer the boats carrying unauthorised migrants across the Mediterranean serves to combat human smuggling or rather as an avenue to criminalise migration itself. The article’s central argument posits that ‘captains’, instead of being integral members of organised human smuggling networks, represent only a small aspect of migratory dynamics. They are vulnerable targets whose criminalization is indicative of a wider process of securitization in border control.
The research focuses on developing a computational model (agent-based) to describe and analyse the structure and evolution of a conspiracy bubble within Facebook. The methodological framework relies on a hypothesis, previously validated in other digital contexts, asserting that user groups interested in conspiracy topics form not isolated cliques but rather constitute a subculture characterised by a system of “subjective understanding” (Tucker, W. T. (1965). Max Weber's verstehen. Sociol Q, 6(2), 157–165) and specific interpretative categories (Russo & Cecconi, Russo, V., Cecconi, F. (2023). Collettivi digitali e cultura della disinformazione. Analisi di una bolla cospirazionista durante la pandemia di Covid-19. Sociologia Italiana, (22).; Barkun, Barkun, A culture of conspiracy: Apocalyptic visions in contemporary America, University of California Press, 2013; Grusauskaite et al., Grusauskaite et al., New Media & Society, 2023). In accordance with this hypothesis, the research design incorporates four types of entities: the conspiracy articles generated in the digital space, the websites where they come from, the public pages and groups where they are shared, and the users engaging with this content. The methodological process unfolds in two phases: (1)descriptive, data mining and analysis of the content and structure of a conspiracy bubble, along with the construction of a relational dataset; (2)experimental, development of the agent-based model, creation of scenarios, model validation, simulation, and subsequent data analysis. The research findings reveal a bubble comprising a singular component characterised by hub nodes functioning as cultural catalysts and specific interpretative categories shared among users. Simulation results show that the network fragments in response to changes in two article properties acting as ‘glue’: political orientation and the incitement of fear and hate.
The aims of this scoping review were to generate an overview of the existing literature on the role emotions play in pastoral care, to determine what research has been done, and to consider how this knowledge is being applied in pastoral care and counseling. Four databases (Atla Religion Database [Atla RDB], Medline Ovid, PsycINFO Ovid, and Education Resources Information Center [ERIC]) were researched for studies exploring emotions in pastoral care and counseling. Forty-six empirical studies published over a period of 10 years (2010–2021) were included in the scoping review. The authors read and analyzed the articles with a focus on how individuals experience emotions and on how the articles addressed emotions in their studies. Based upon the results of thematic analysis, we identified five themes: (1) aiming for a new PCC praxis, (2) the two main types of pastoral care, (3) a focus on basic emotions, (4) changing emotions in pastoral care, and (5) the development of creative methodologies to approach emotions within PCC. To date, there has been little research in this field regarding connecting conceptualizations and strategies to address emotions in the context of pastoral care. This scoping review addresses this issue and highlights the need for future studies and practical applications.
This conversation with Patricia McCormick discusses her critically acclaimed novelSold(2006), which follows a thirteen-year-old girl trafficked into the sex trade from Nepal to India. Patricia McCormick is an American journalist, writer of crime and realistic fiction, and winner of several awards. McCormick exposes the dark world of sex trafficking using her first-hand experiences with victims and survivors with her journalistic knowledge. This interview, conducted in September 2024, explores McCormick’s narrative techniques, her approach to depicting the trauma of sexual violence, memory as a healing component, and the ethical dilemmas she navigates in writing about sensitive topics. It reveals insights into McCormick’s background research and creative process, and the challenges in striking a balance between the brutal realities of sex trafficking and the need to offer hope. The paper addresses the gaps in existing research by providing first-hand insights into the author’s approach, thereby offering a viewpoint on the nexus of literature, the experience of sexual violence, and social justice, highlighting howSoldcontributes to contemporary discourses about the representation of trauma in literature. In summation, the conversation speaks to the relevance ofSoldin literary, societal, and cultural contexts, highlighting its role in raising awareness and fostering empathy among young adult readers.
Maintaining personal wellbeing is essential for an effective pandemic response due to its multifaceted impacts on various aspects of society. This study aimed to evaluate personal wellbeing during pandemic response and investigate the effects of built environment in neighborhoods, risk communication, and health indicators. A cross-sectional survey design was adopted. A sample with 5458 participants was collected in Hong Kong through a self-administered online survey. Personal Wellbeing Index- Adult (PWI-A) was adopted to measure personal wellbeing. This study indicated a more than 20% decrease in personal wellbeing among Hong Kong residents during the pandemic, particularly impacting future security, personal safety, and living standards. Positive influences on wellbeing included more open spaces, using more traditional information channels, seeking reliable media sources, and confidence in information seeking. Conversely, wellbeing was negatively affected by a higher percentage of public residential areas, using more new information channels, increased social media time, smoking habits and chronic health conditions. These findings provide critical insights into the diverse impacts of the pandemic on individuals and communities. They guide targeted interventions and contribute to building resilience against future crises.
Family business dominates the Indian corporate landscape, reflecting the country’s strong familial culture. While sustainability in family business is a growing research area, its understanding in the Indian context remains limited. This study aims to investigate the factors contributing to family business sustainability in India and examines the relationships among these factors. Employing a qualitative approach, this research analyzes multiple case studies from Gujarat and Rajasthan. Data was collected through in-depth interviews with family business owners and successors and analyzed using content analysis. The findings reveal five key factors contributing to family business sustainability: succession planning, strategic diversification and expansion, innovation and adaptability, mentorship and knowledge transfer, and competitive advantage. A conceptual framework illustrates the interconnectedness of these factors, highlighting how succession planning supports knowledge transfer and fosters innovation, while strategic diversification often requires innovative approaches. This research offers valuable insights for family business owners navigating growth and sustainability challenges. It also provides a foundation for policymakers to develop targeted measures supporting family business, which significantly contribute to India’s economy. The study’s originality lies in its focus on the Indian context, offering a nuanced understanding of family business sustainability in a rapidly evolving emerging economy. By exploring the unique characteristics of Indian family businesses, this research contributes to the literature on family business sustainability in diverse cultural contexts.
Climate change is undeniably one of the most urgent issues of our era, with consequences that will profoundly shape our lives and the well-being of our families. Already, climate change-related worries impact how individuals plan for the future. Recent literature has investigated how psychological stressors, like concerns about climate change, impact decision-making. Building on this, we utilize the theory of imagined futures to explore how climate change influences the retirement savings behavior of millennials, a demographic often seen as financially unprepared for retirement, and as the first generation to come of age and build a family amidst the climate crisis. Through 50 in-depth interviews, we identify five main themes: climate stress, hopeful horizons, financial planning amidst future uncertainties, embracing the present, and the parenthood effect. These themes encompass a wide range of perspectives on retirement savings behavior in the context of climate change. While some participants see climate change as a reason to save more for an uncertain future, others view the unpredictable nature of climate change as a reason to enjoy their resources now, before environmental challenges make such opportunities less feasible. Drawing from our findings, we offer implications for individuals planning for retirement, financial advisors, and policymakers.
This paper investigates whether the adoption of E-learning by firms contributed to offset the decrease in firm-sponsored training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a novel firm level survey linked with administrative data on the universe of workers within those firms, I study the role of E-learning in firms’ training activities during the crisis. I find that the COVID-19 pandemic substantially decreased firm-sponsored training by up to 11 percentage points. However, firms’ ability to use E-learning nullifies this negative effect. Furthermore, the differential capabilities of firms to apply E-learning might exacerbate already prevalent inequalities in training opportunities.
PurposeThe psychometric properties of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS-4D), an oral health-related quality-of-life tool for children, and EuroQol 5D-Young (EQ-5D-Y), a commonly used generic quality-of-life tool for children, were compared across a clinical severity index to determine which tool is better for measuring oral health-related quality of life in children.MethodsDelayed and filled surfaces score (dfs) was calculated for under six-year-old children at the recruitment and one year later. ECOHIS-4D and EQ-5D were filled out on both occasions. The following properties were examined: (i) Content validity by comparing mean utility values using the Wilcoxson Signed Rank Test and Bland Altman Test, (ii) Construct validity (ability to discriminate between groups of different clinical severity) by examining effect size between severity groups (iii) Responsiveness (for changes in health status) using floor and ceiling effect, standard response mean and linear regression (iv) Correlation between the utilities and dfs.ResultsRespectively, 287 and 189 children were examined at the baseline and follow-up. Mean utility estimates from the tools were significantly different. All items of EQ-5D-Y showed high ceiling effects compared to items of ECOHIS-4D. Only the utility scores of ECOHIS-4D showed a significant association with the dfs score (β=-0.003, 95%CI=-0.004 to -0.002) in the linear regression models. Utility values form ECOHIS-4D, but not EQ-5D-Y correlated with the dfs (spearman’s r=-0.33, 95%CI -0.43 to -0.23).ConclusionECOHIS-4D performs better than EQ-5D-Y in assessing young children’s oral health-related quality of life.
Recently, parties that are run by and for ethnic minority citizens with a migration background have become more prominent. They can be considered a manifestation of ethnic political segregation. A key example of such a party is DENK in the Netherlands. So far, the explanatory literature has focused on how programmatic considerations drives voting for these parties. Other factors, such as the role of social networks in mobilization, have received limited testing and limited exploration in more detail. Furthermore, the literature on social networks is mainly based on majority populations. To inform our understanding of the role of social networks in voting (in general but also particularly among ethnic minority communities and for ethnic minority interest parties) this paper analyzes the voting behavior for DENK focusing on the role of personal, online and religious networks. The paper uses both qualitative interviews (with bicultural youth in the third largest city of the Netherlands in 2022) and quantitative surveys (the 2021 Dutch Ethnic Minority Electoral Study). Our analysis points to the importance of religious and personal networks for voting for DENK, whereas online networks appear to be less relevant.
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death in the United States and may be prevented through improved working conditions. The United States does not guarantee paid sick leave (PSL) at the federal level. We used quasi-experimental event study methods to examine the relationship between state-level PSL policies and county-level CVD mortality among working-age adults aged 15 to 64 over time (2008 to 2019). We examined the annual CVD mortality rates in 1054 counties from all 50 states and Washington D.C.. In the Northeastern region of the United States, there were drops in the CVD mortality rate in all years after PSL was adopted. We found no effect of PSL in the Western United States with a strong presence of pretreatment effects, making the results for that region uninterpretable. Our results support the use of state-level PSL policies to reduce county-level CVD mortality rates in the Northeastern United States.
This paper explores the health impacts and coping strategies for dealing with extreme indoor temperatures among vulnerable urban communities in Sekondi-Takoradi, Ghana. It examines the groups most affected, key vulnerability factors, and the health impacts of extreme temperatures, along with residents’ adaptation strategies. Data were gathered through surveys, focus group discussions, participants’ observations, and expert interviews. The findings reveal that extreme indoor temperatures lead to health challenges such as heat stress, rashes, dehydration, dizziness, skin irritation, and exacerbated respiratory conditions. Children, the elderly, and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable due to their limited physiological and socio-economic resilience. Although natural ventilation and electric fans are commonly used coping strategies, power outages and high electricity costs limit their effectiveness. The paper emphasizes the need for a multi-dimensional approach to improve housing infrastructure, develop affordable cooling technologies, and incorporate green spaces into urban housing. It also underscores the importance of inclusive strategies to address vulnerability factors and strengthen resilience among vulnerable populations, offering insights into the long-term health and socio-economic consequences of extreme temperatures.
PurposeFatigue is the most prevalent symptom across cancer types. To support clinicians in providing fatigue-related supportive care, this study aims to develop and compare models predicting clinically relevant fatigue (CRF) occurring between two and three years after diagnosis, and to assess the validity of the best-performing model across diverse cancer populations.MethodsPatients with non-metastatic bladder, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, or prostate cancer who completed a questionnaire within three months after diagnosis and a subsequent questionnaire between two and three years thereafter, were included. Predictor variables included clinical, socio-demographic, and patient-reported variables. The outcome was CRF (EORTC QLQC30 fatigue ≥ 39). Logistic regression using LASSO selection was compared to more advanced Machine Learning (ML) based models, including Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Internal–external cross-validation was conducted on the best-performing model.Results3160 patients were included. The logistic regression model had the highest C-statistic (0.77) and balanced accuracy (0.65), both indicating good discrimination between patients with and without CRF. However, sensitivity was low across all models (0.22–0.37). Following internal–external validation, performance across cancer types was consistent (C-statistics 0.73–0.82).ConclusionAlthough the models’ discrimination was good, the low balanced accuracy and poor calibration in the presence of CRF indicates a relatively high likelihood of underdiagnosis of future CRF. Yet, the clinical applicability of the model remains uncertain. The logistic regression performed better than the ML-based models and was robust across cohorts, suggesting an advantage of simpler models to predict CRF.
For over two decades, researchers have called for strength-based perspectives in socialization research. To date, it is unclear how well other researchers have answered that call. The current study systematically reviewed studies published since 2010 that focused on observed behaviors of parents living in the United States during play interactions with their young child. A total of 47 studies met final inclusion criteria. Methodological information for each study (i.e., ethnic-racial or cultural group inclusion, proportion of white versus people of color) were documented. Additionally, each study was coded based on the negative-, positive-, or neutral-lens used in the study framework or findings. These study features were analyzed to determine 1) if researchers had adopted a positive lens, and 2) if there were certain characteristics of studies that did. Overall, roughly 50% of reviewed studies used a positive- or strength-based lens. We found that when researchers did not include a white comparison group, there was a higher likelihood of positive framing. These findings indicate there is still room for improvement in a more unified adoption of strength-based research.
Local political news is losing consumers over the past decade at a faster rate than other political media, while online news consumption is growing. Previous research shows that local news can slow polarization, encourage political participation, and reduce government and business corruption, but not whether changes over time can affect political attitudes. Is this consequential shift in the media environment associated with changes in Americans’ perceptions of electoral integrity and their system of government? We use a three-wave panel survey from 2012 to 2014 to assess the relationship between changes in self-reported news diets and opinions about American elections and democracy. Switching out of local newspapers is associated with a significant decrease in faith in elections but does not appear to influence support for the broader U.S. system of government. We conclude by discussing the implications of declining local and legacy media news use for Americans’ attitudes toward U.S. elections and democracy in the aftermath of the 2020 elections.
Environmental social scientists have demonstrated that one path to caring for nature is spending time appreciating it. This paper asks why spending time in nature leads to this care and proposes connections between knowledge and emotion and the extension of the self as a mechanism for this link. It develops a general theory of care based on these connections between knowledge and emotion and extension of the self. The data come from a five-year ethnography at a nature centre in Toronto, Ontario, involving 50 interviews and over 500 hours in the field. I find that people care because connections between knowledge and emotion create opportunities for the extension of the self. Specifically, nature knowledge parses out pieces of nature – such as protected areas and species – and emotions make these pieces emotionally vibrant. This emotional resonance based on specialized knowledge, in turn, creates opportunities for people to extend their sense of self to emotionally resonant parts of nature. Once people understand parts of nature as an extension of the self, threats to nature can galvanize care, to preserve what has become part of the self.
Internet finance is a prominent sector within the digital finance industry, presenting both opportunities and challenges for individual investors and financial institutions. Using data from the China Household Finance Survey in 2015, 2017, and 2019, this study constructs a three-year balanced panel to empirically analyze the impact of participation in internet financial products on household financial vulnerability. An intermediary effect model is employed to examine the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, regional and age heterogeneity are explored. The study found that internet finance not only significantly reduces household financial vulnerability but also enhances financial distress by improving participants’ financial literacy and capacity. Additionally, participation in internet financial products affects users’ risk attitudes and economic behaviors, increasing their level of concern for the economy, boosting their investment confidence, and improving their investment performance in other financial activities, thereby mitigating household financial vulnerability.
Every person should feel accepted at work. Organizations can signal that all identities are welcomed and protected through affirming factors in their environment, known as identity-safety cues. However, there are also things organizations can do to signal that certain identities are not welcome. Thus, the current study aims to identify the factors that can impact identity safety perceptions among transgender and gender expansive employees of color, as the past literature on transgender and gender expansive identity-safety cues predominately includes White-majority samples. This study analyzes the intersection of marginalized racial/ethnic and gender identities, and how these combined identities impact the perceptions of identity safety. Researchers conducted 21 semi-structured interviews through Zoom, which were analyzed by hand and through Dedoose software using reflexive thematic analysis. Results found that minimal, partial, or incomplete identity support may signalsomeidentity safety, but the ideal inclusion is support for all identities, and the intersection of those identities. Indeed, limited identity support, insufficient organizational systems, performativity, and discrimination can restrict perceptions of identity safety, while interpersonal support, intersectional representation, and inclusive organizational policies can signal identity safety. Overall, results indicated that it is not sufficient for organizations to signal identity safety for one identity, or for each identity separately; but rather, intersectional support is needed to allow transgender and gender expansive employees of color to feel safe at work.
This article explores the relationship between public (i.e. government-led) and private (i.e. industry-led) forms of lobby regulation, by inquiring over the conditions that render a mix between these two regulatory forms more likely. Drawing on the governance of professions scholarship, it presents a theoretically informed comparison between two jurisdictions—the US (federal level) and the EU (supranational level)—where the public regulation of lobbying is built on different models, namely a command-and-control model based on legally binding rules in the US and a cooperative model based on incentives and rewards in the EU. Findings show that, although formal public–private regulatory mixes are not present in either jurisdiction, the EU regulators have hewn closer to this arrangement by coopting lobbyists’ professional associations as semi-permanent but unofficial governance ‘allies’. This outcome is due to an amalgam of factors, chief among which is the severity of political scandals involving lobbyists, which affects policymakers’ reputational incentives for framing the public regulation of lobbying as a punitive or cooperative intervention. Methodologically, the article uses a combination of documentary analysis and expert interviews with lobby practitioners and public regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.
This study examined the effect of a shared reading routine on the geometry vocabulary knowledge of four preschool children at risk for language delays. Literacy-based interventions can be used to teach vocabulary for children at risk for language delays, incorporating interactive questioning techniques and explicit definitions. Children were taught geometry vocabulary, specifically attributes (i.e., characteristics) of two-dimensional shapes and examples from the storybooks (i.e., contextualized examples) and personal experiences (i.e., decontextualized examples). A dialogic shared reading activity was used with the PEER scaffolding steps and selected question prompts from CROWD with multiple exposures to the target words. This study utilized a single-case, multiple probe across word sets (i.e., tiers) and intervention sessions were delivered one-on-one with each participant. A probe, referred to as a knowledge check, was administered in every session across phases. Each participant improved in some aspects of geometry vocabulary knowledge. Suggestions for future research to build upon this intervention are discussed.
The development of self-regulation is critical for children’s positive interactions with others and successful adjustment to school. Using their self-regulation skills, children can adapt their temperamental, emotional, and behavioral reactions to environmental stimuli. Greater self-regulation is advantageous in the classroom, as more regulated children have an easier time with basic behavioral expectations, and are more likely to persist with difficult tasks, work efficiently, and pay attention to instructions. INSIGHTS into Children’s Temperament (INSIGHTS) is a temperament-based intervention that improves kindergarten and first-grade children’s social-emotional development and academic learning. In the current study, we examined the effects of INSIGHTS on rural Midwestern children’s self-regulation development (i.e., attention, inhibitory control), compared to control classrooms. In addition, we explored the effects of children’s baseline self-regulation and the effects of the intervention on children’s developmental trajectories. Students (N= 147) from 61 classrooms were randomly assigned to INSIGHTS or control conditions by school. Children’s self-regulation skills whereas examined at four different times. Multiple regression models were fit, and results suggest that INSIGHTS participants exhibited greater self-regulation at Time 4 as compared to the control group. Additionally, latent growth curve models were used to model linear growth. Results suggest that INSIGHTS participants experienced increased growth rates for attention, inhibitory control, and sustained attention compared to the control group. Our study provides evidence for the positive effects of a social-emotional classroom intervention on the developmental trajectory of children’s self-regulation.
The writing process approach is recognized as an effective instructional practice for engaging children in the writing process and developing emerging writing skills. The writing conference is an integral component of the writing process. One-on-one conferencing sessions create differentiated instructional spaces for teachers to respond to the individual needs of learners. Understanding how teachers leverage conferencing sessions to effectively engage and support young learners’ writing remains a limited area of research. This case study documents one experienced teacher’s conferencing practices with 19 first-grade writers. Findings show conferencing conversations worked in an integrated, multidimensional way to support young writers. Conferencing dimensions leveraged children’s funds of knowledge, questioning and affirming statements, and writers’ craft components to nurture relationships and offer feedback aligned with children’s zone of proximal development.
This qualitative study examines the experiences and functions of gender among people who do not identify their genders as exclusively either man or woman (e.g., genderfluid, nonconforming, agender, genderqueer, multigender, nonbinary people). In this paper, we use the term “not-binary” as an inclusive term that refers to these gender identities categorically. Semi-structured interviews with 17 participants living in the U.S. focused on meanings and functions of gender; processes of navigating intrapersonal, interpersonal, and sociopolitical experiences; and intersectional identities. Responses were analyzed using critical-constructivist grounded theory method (Levitt in Essentials of critical-constructivist grounded theory research, American Psychological Association, 2021). Findings revealed that participants intentionally engaged in processes of gender exploration, contestation, and transformation to deliberately challenge and reshape their own conceptualization of gender and that of others. Participants shared the meanings of their identities and pronouns for expressing their sense of self, and how they wished others to interact with them, as well as the complications of language for expressing genders that can be fluid and changing. In addition, participants conveyed the experience of having their gender identities politicized and their rights contested on the national stage. Expanding the transnormative narrative that focuses on gender dysphoria, participants highlighted affirming community and positive and euphoric gender experiences that supported them to engage in resistance to oppressive forces. These findings underscore the importance of education on not-binary experiences, the provision of gender affirming care, and the correction of public misinformation for the well-being of non-binary individuals.
Even though young Hispanic children have experienced a high net undercount in the past three U.S. Censuses, we know very little about what explains the undercount. We examine how every state experienced the undercount in 2010 and 2020. We also investigate the association of state-level factors grouped into six domains—racial/ethnic and immigrant composition; political affiliation and immigrant policy climate; housing; family structure and living arrangements; socioeconomic status; and census response/return rates—with the net coverage rate of Hispanic children under age five in the 2010 and 2020 Census. We find that the number of states undercounting young Hispanics increased in one decade, and the undercount worsened in three-fifths of states. We also find that racial/ethnic and immigrant composition, housing, and children’s living arrangements have the strongest associations with the undercount of young Hispanic children in both censuses. The size of states’ Hispanic, foreign-born, and noncitizen populations was positively associated with the 2020 undercount, particularly in states where these groups account for a small proportion of the population. However, the association flattened as the proportion of these groups increased. States with smaller shares of these populations tended to have the most restrictive immigration policies in 2020. Housing characteristics and children’s living arrangements consistently influenced the undercount in both censuses. Lastly, language barriers contributed to the 2020 undercount of young Hispanic children. By identifying factors related to higher undercounts of young Hispanic children, this study builds a knowledge base that could result in a more accurate count of young children in the 2030 Census.
Persons deemed a danger to themselves, others, or gravely disabled may receive involuntary psychiatric commitment if family, other residents, law enforcement, or clinicians initiate this process. On September 30, 2005, a Danish newspaper published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. This publication led to the worst foreign policy crisis in Denmark since World War II. Whereas protests within Denmark against the cartoon remained peaceful, this cartoon controversy—including the attacks on four Danish embassies outside of Denmark—may have reduced societal tolerance for threatening or deviant behavior among non-Western immigrants. We applied Box-Jenkins interrupted time-series methods to test whether this cartoon controversy coincided with greater than expected counts of new involuntary psychiatric commitments among non-Western immigrants. The analytic period spans 48 quarters from January 1995 to December 2006. Findings support the hypothesis in that new involuntary psychiatric commitments rose 43% during the controversy (p<.01). Changes in help-seeking overall for mental health services do not appear to account for this rise in new involuntary commitments. Population-wide controversies may lower societal tolerance for behavior deemed deviant—and in this case, specifically among non-Western immigrants.
Historically, religion and nationalism were opposing forces in many countries. Recently, however, they began to converge as part of rising populist movements globally. In the Muslim world, the partnership between Islamists and nationalists has become evident in several important countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Malaysia. This merging of Islamism and populist nationalism in the last decade signifies a third period in the Muslim world, following the era of secularist domination (1920s–1970s) and the era of Islamization (1970s–2010s). Some Islamic conservatives might regard the unification of religious and nationalist forces as beneficial to their conservative agenda. Nonetheless, this comes at the high cost of discrimination against Muslim minorities in several countries, such as India, Israel, the United States, and France. Beyond Muslim-majority countries and Muslim minorities, the global trend of advancing a religious-nationalist agenda threatens minority rights. This trend poses a major challenge to democracy, equal citizenship, and minority rights worldwide.
This study aimed to evaluate the role of neuroinflammation in neuronal and glial cells in the pathophysiology of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) through different biomarkers.S100-B and VILIP-1 levels of patients diagnosed with MDD were evaluated before and after antidepressant treatment. A total of 65 patients diagnosed with MDD and 69 healthy controls were included. Serum levels of S100B and VILIP-1 were measured at the time of diagnosis and after eight weeks antidepressant treatment and compared with healthy controls. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) were applied to assess the severity of depression. In our study, although serum S100B levels were higher in patients before treatment compared to healthy controls, this difference was not statistically significant. Regarding VILIP-1 levels, there was no statistically significant difference between patients and healthy controls. A positive and statistically significant correlation was found between S100B and VILIP-1 levels in MDD group before the treatment. At the eighth week of treatment, a statistically significant positive correlation was also found between S100B and VILIP-1 levels. Our research is the first study to evaluate MDD through two separate biomarkers specific to glial and neuronal cells.The fact that S100B and VILIP-1 levels showed significant correlations in patients diagnosed with MDD both before and after treatment suggests that they may play a shared role in the pathophysiology of the disorder. The correlation between S100B and VILIP-1 may serve as a guide in understanding the pathophysiology of the disorder and in identifying new drug development targets.
Based on some of Erik H. Erikson’s autobiographical references, the author reflects on Erikson’s relationship with his mother, Karla Abrahamsen Homburger. The author then introduces his mother, María Guadalupe Mejía Herrera, and recounts some of the “beautiful flowers” in her garden, notably supporting the author’s vocational journey. The author analyzes how theological seminaries are akin to Erikson’s concept of psychosocial moratorium. He concludes by offering a few recommendations to accompany care seekers as they mourn the death of a parenting person.
Adolescents may be exposed to online content depicting substance use, raising the question of how exposure to others’ online substance use content relates to one’s own use. Additionally, it is of interest to explore how parental restrictive (i.e., media content restriction) and active mediation (i.e., media content discussion) may relate to links between online substance use exposure and substance use. In a sample of 1017 U.S. adolescents (55% female; T1Mage= 15.04), this longitudinal study examined links between exposure to peers’ online postings about substances and adolescents’ own alcohol, marijuana, cigarette, and e-cigarette use two years later. Adolescents’ Time 1 exposure to peers’ online substance postings was generally associated with greater Time 2 marijuana use, alcohol use, and, to some extent, e-cigarette use. Greater Time 1 cigarette use was associated withlowerTime 2 exposure to peers’ online substance postings. Time 1 parent-reported restrictive mediation was associated with lower Time 2 exposure to online postings, but mediation did not buffer associations between exposure and use. Intervention and prevention efforts should be geared towards targeting risky content adolescents are exposed to online, and what parenting behaviors may be effective in attenuating associations between online substance exposure and use.
In many Western countries, the ideology of intensive parenting has gained prominence in the discourse of experts, policymakers, and within popular culture. This ideology emphasizes deep parental involvement in emotional, physical, and financial aspects (Lee et al.,2014). Meeting these demanding standards can exert significant pressure on parents, especially on mothers often considered as the primary caregiver. Moreover, these pressures may prompt parents to be highly, and potentially overly, involved in their children’s lives. Using data from 146 parent dyads (N = 292 parents; Mage= 47.57 years) of Swiss adolescents, the study explores parental perceptions of pressure to be a perfect parent and its association with one positive (responsiveness) and two negative types of involvement (overprotection and overvaluation). Thereby, we estimated Actor-Partner Interdependence Models (APIM) to examine mutual influences between mothers and fathers. The results indicated that mothers reported experiencing significantly more pressure than fathers. We found evidence for a positive association between perceptions of pressure and parental overprotection among both parents. The results also showed that there was a significant association between feelings of pressure and overvaluation, but only among fathers. Associations between pressure and responsiveness were not significant, and no significant partner effects were observed in any of the models. In conclusion, mothers particularly face heightened pressure to be perfect parents, but both parents may adapt their parenting strategies in response to perceived pressure to be perfect as a parent. These findings highlight the potential issues associated with societal pressures on parents and their impact on parenting behavior.
Non-take-up of welfare schemes is a key concern of policy effectiveness. Building on studies that have shown the low take-up of minimum income schemes, our case study of Ireland’s Working Family Payment is the first to analyse non-take-up of an in-work benefit and its determinants with a special focus on labour market factors. Based on EU-SILC (2014–2019) we estimate a non-take-up rate between 63 and 76%, which poses a major obstacle for effective poverty prevention. Moreover, we stress that non-take-up of in-work benefits differs to minimum income schemes. We provide new evidence on how labour market characteristics play an important role in explaining non-take-up, especially self-employment and the interaction with unemployment benefits. Benefit erosion is a key factor in declining eligibility, which should be addressed by indexing wages and prices. Furthermore, we propose policy reforms around automatic enrolment or tax credits to mitigate non-take-up and alleviate in-work poverty.
The home literacy environment (HLE) plays an important role in children’s early literacy learning. Texting programs are an increasing feature of family literacy interventions that support parent engagement in their children’s learning. Unlike face-to-face interventions, texting programs can offer sustained parental support at low cost and large scale. Messages can be translated into other languages, saved and shared, thus potentially widening the influence on children’s HLEs. Most early literacy texting programs target families from disadvantaged communities, yet research suggests all families may benefit from guidance on supporting their children’s early literacy. This study examined the receptiveness of a universal early literacy texting program, Kindytxt, by parents of kindergarten children from low, medium and high socioeconomic communities. Kindytxt was developed as a component of a universal book gifting program that uses a library-school model of program delivery and has statewide reach. Parents received 90 texts over 30 weeks and were invited to provide feedback via SMS at several intervals. Non-parametric tests were used to compare parent responses based on community-level socioeconomic status. Similarly high levels of parental support were evident across all socioeconomic strata. We argue that a universal approach can avoid the stigma and potentially lower uptake of programs that target disadvantaged families. Moreover, the Kindytxt cooperative delivery model allows targeted strategies to be incorporated within the universal program. Teachers and librarians can proactively bolster recruitment to the texting program and support parents to differentiate the literacy activities to suit their child’s cultural context and level of literacy development.
Canada is known for its moderate liberal-left stance, lacking a deeply entrenched far-right movement or extreme right-wing media—a phenomenon termed Canadian exceptionalism (Peker and Winter2024). Despite this, Canada has produced a globally famous conservative intellectual, Jordan Peterson, and Canada was the site of the 2022 Freedom Convoy where truckers shut down the Canadian capital, Ottawa, for days in protest against vaccine mandates. This has led some to view Canada as a breeding ground for right-wing extremism even though the far right remains marginal in Canada compared to Germany, France, or the USA. This paper argues that the paradox of Canada producing Peterson and a massive populist revolt can be explained by exploring the prominence of Canadian conservative and far-right internet personalities, such as Ezra Levant and Lauren Southern. This Canadian paradox flows from the weakness of right-wing parties and media, coupled with Trudeau’s elitist liberalism administration and a progressive-leaning media. These conditions and the lack of open debate they create, assisted by the international reach of the English language, facilitated the remarkable rise of multiple Canadian figures in global right-wing discourse online, despite the relative weakness of the organized political right. Peterson’s fame highlights how elitist liberalism can produce an internet-based reaction against itself. The internet has functioned as a place of refuge for Canadian conservatives deemed to be beyond the pale of the domestic political culture. Whether or not these figures can leverage their global internet popularity to spark a populist movement within the mainstream Canadian political sphere is explored in this article.
ObjectiveThis article visualises money laundering, a crime spanning hundreds of different actors, methods and value instruments, as a network. Possible combinations of money laundering actions and schemes are analysed through a holistic visualisation to draw policy-relevant insights into their prevention.MethodsA prior scoping review of money laundering typologies identified 793 activities that a money launderer can take to obfuscate illicit funds. These actions form the basis of a directed network graph showcasing all possible combinations of money laundering schemes. Three network-based analyses are then conducted: (1) centrality analysis, to determine the most ‘important’ money laundering actions as priorities for prevention, (2) resilience analysis to simulate iterative interventions against different money laundering actions to assess their impact on the wider network and (3) subgroup analysis to identify groups of commonly undertaken schemes (i.e. “typologies”).ResultsMoney laundering is found to be a highly resilient process crime, with specific interventions often unable to prevent schemes from displacing to alternative activities to launder their funds. However, benefits of tactically displacing criminals to more easily detectable schemes are discussed. The formulation of money laundering typologies through more empirically robust processes is also motivated, in place of compartmentalised reports that remain the current standard practice.ConclusionsNetwork analysis is motivated as an effective way of visualising complex process crimes with vast criminal opportunities such as money laundering, allowing policy-relevant insights to be drawn in terms of resource-allocation, strategy and prioritisation. Theoretical and policy implications of the current study are discussed in the context of crime scientific theories.
Young children are natural scientists, exploring the world around them from infancy. While early childhood classrooms abound in opportunities to integrate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), early educators need to intentionally design and implement accessible learning experiences so that all children can develop STEM knowledge and skills. As such, it is essential to understand teachers’ perspectives toward STEM instruction in their everyday classroom practice. Guided by the integrated STEM framework, we examined eight preschool teachers’ STEM teaching practices through in-depth interviews. We present themes related to teachers’ implementation of transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and independent exploratory STEM teaching approaches, their observations of both STEM-specific and non-STEM-specific learning outcomes, strategies teachers employed to create equitable and inclusive STEM learning experiences, and their orientation and confidence toward teaching STEM. This study contributes to the literature by exploring the realities of integrated STEM teaching and learning in everyday preschool settings and offering insights into better supporting teachers in this area.
In the United States, populations of Latino individuals tend to have better mortality outcomes than socioeconomically similar racial and ethnic comparators; this has been termed the “Latino Paradox”. However, advantages from the Latino paradox seem to fade and may be susceptible to other factors (like the COVID-19 pandemic). Quality primary care may improve mortality, but the effect of the intersection of all of these factors in Latino patients is uncertain. There is burgeoning evidence that Latino patients may have more robust utilization of high value primary care services, especially when accessible in a community-oriented fashion. This utilization may become less robust, especially in services that require a more integrated delivery system, as individuals and generations spend more time in the United States. Primary care research may provide additional insights into the underpinnings of the Latino paradox and may complement the public health foundation that has undergirded work on the paradox in the last few decades. Investments in primary care infrastructure and research may be beneficial to the health of Latinos in the United States, and incorporating the needs of this diverse population into primary care system design at scale may pay large dividends for our societal health.
PurposePreference-based summary scores are used to quantify values, differences, and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) that can be used for cost-effectiveness analyses. The PROMIS-Preference (PROPr) measure is a preference-based summary score comprised of 7 PROMIS domains. The PROMIS-16 is a new PROMIS profile instrument. We evaluated the measurement properties of PROPr generated from the widely used PROMIS-29 + 2 compared with the PROMIS-16.MethodsWe performed a secondary analysis of data from an online survey of the general US population, with a longitudinal subsample who reported back pain. The survey included both the PROMIS-16 and the PROMIS-29 + 2 profiles. PROPr scores were calculated from each profile and compared by the distribution of scores, overall mean scores, product-moment correlations with pain measure scores (Oswestry Disability Index, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, Pain Intensity, Interference with Enjoyment of Life, Interference with General Activity Scale, and Graded Chronic Pain Scale), and difference in mean scores in subgroups with 13 chronic health conditions (Cohen’s d).ResultsOf the 4,115 participants in the baseline survey, 1,533 with any reported back pain were invited for the 6-month follow-up survey and 1,256 completed it. At baseline, the overall mean (SD) PROPr score was 0.532 (0.240) from PROMIS-16 and 0.535 (0.250) from PROMIS 29 + 2. At both time points, the correlations of PROPr scores with physical and mental health summary scores from the PROMIS-29 and 4 pain scales were within 0.01 between profiles. Using subgroups with chronic health conditions and comparing between profiles, Cohen’s d estimates of the difference in effect size were small (< 0.2).ConclusionPROPr scores from the 16-item PROMIS profile measure are similar to PROPr scores from the longer PROMIS-29 + 2.
Social role theory (Eagly,1987) posits that gender differences in career interests are consistent with normative social role expectations, with men assuming more agentic roles and women assuming more communal roles. To account for historical shifts in occupations and social roles, this mixed-methods study re-examines gender differences in career interests and motivations with a sample of 501 eighth graders (52% girls; 40% White) from the U.S. Findings indicated that boys and girls had distinct career interests and motivations. Despite preferring careers that were generally dominated by their own gender, students perceived their chosen career as being more gender balanced than U.S. labor force statistics indicate. This misperception might be the result of a preference for less stereotypical occupations, and may reflect a unique characteristic of the next-generation workforce. In addition, boys were more likely than girls to indicate that salary factored into their career choice; whereas girls were more likely than boys to indicate that a desire for helping others or working with children motivated their career choice, consistent with social role theory. Some motivational factors that are typically linked with young adult career preferences were not strong factors in younger adolescents’ career interests, perhaps due to the developmental status of participants or a generational shift in values. A generational shift in values may account for the presence of a relatively understudied motivational factor, occupation creativity, which was important for both boys and girls. Addressing gender differences in the motivations and goals that affect career interests may both alleviate workforce shortages and achieve a less gender segregated work environment.
Studies regarding dysgraphia, an impairment in writing, have been receiving more attention in recent research. Most studies have broadly discussed the multiple cognitive mechanisms involved in writing and its disruption leading to dysgraphia. However, little attention has been paid to the involvement of different memory systems integral to writing and its disruption in individuals with dysgraphia. Orthographic long-term memory and orthographic working memory are the two memory systems predominantly involved in the production of written expressions, and the subsequent interruption of these memory systems often leads to varied deficit profiles of dysgraphia. These disruptions have resulted from damage in the brain caused by neural injuries, neurological disorders, or epigenetic factors. The existing studies did not probe into the nuances of the disruptions of these two memory systems in dysgraphia and associated neural pathways. In order to fill this gap, the review attempts to provide a comprehensive account of dysgraphia and its association with orthographic long-term memory and orthographic working memory by comparing and contrasting their workings and patterns of disruption in the deficit profiles of dysgraphia by probing into the underlying neural correlates. Such a detailed account brings insights into pertinent intervention strategies for improving memory systems and dysgraphia. It also helps identify the limitations of the existing intervention methods like CART, ACT, or Spell-Study-Spell, leading to the proposal of improvised neuro-targeted interventions for dysgraphia.
Religion can fulfill both positive and negative functions in coping with stress. There is a lack of research regarding the mechanism underlying the link between religious coping and mental health. The purpose of this study was to verify how religious coping is related to mental health. Two indirect mechanisms were tested for finding meaning in life and emotional regulation. The study was conducted with 115 students from Poland. According to the results, both positive and negative religious coping were indirectly related to hopelessness through finding meaning in life and affectivity. More frequent use of negative religious coping was positively related to the intensity of negative affect and problems with finding meaning in life, which, in turn, led to a higher level of hopelessness. Meanwhile, more frequent use of positive religious coping was correlated with a greater intensity of positive effect and supported individuals in finding meaning in life. Finding meaning in life was related to a lower level of hopelessness, but positive affect was not correlated with hopelessness. The research confirmed the role played by finding meaning in life and affectivity within the mechanism underlying the link between religious coping and hopelessness. In conclusion, theoretical and practical implications are presented.
Based on in-depth interviews with female cadets, this article explores what it is like to be a young military woman in the 2020s. Focusing on the Swedish Armed Forces this study takes its point of departure in minority group processes examined from a gender perspective. How do young military women navigate challenges specific to their gendered positionalities, and to what extent are coping strategies needed in this male-dominated environment? The article concludes that despite an increased focus on gender equality and a more welcoming attitude to military women, persistent norms of masculinity remain challenging for women in military settings. At the same time, young military women may have found new ways of navigating the burden of visibility that women in minority often struggle with. For example, while gendered performance pressure remains a reality, strategies of disassociating oneself from other women, in line with previous theorising, do not appear to be a dominant coping strategy. This generation of women entered the military under different circumstances than those who paved the way. The reassurance of being strategically prioritised may have inspired new ways of navigating a fear of visibility, in contrast with previous generations who often rejected the idea of female networks within the organisation. Young military women of today might therefore be more inclined to fight structural challenges. Given the gendered challenges military women still face, it remains to be seen whether these forms of gendered empowerment will be enough to retain them.
BackgroundWe derived meaningful individual-level change thresholds for worsening in selected patient-reported outcomes version of the common terminology criteria for adverse events (PRO-CTCAE®) items and their composite scores.MethodsWe used two data sources, the PRO-TECT trial (Alliance AFT-39) that collected PRO-CTCAE data from adults with advanced cancer at 26 United States (U.S.) community oncology practices and the PRO-CTCAE validation study that collected PRO-CTCAE data from adults undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy at nine U.S. cancer centers or community oncology practices. Both studies administered selected PRO-CTCAE items and EORTC QLQ-C30 scales. Conceptually, relevant QLQ-C30 domains were used as anchors to estimate meaningful change thresholds for deterioration in corresponding PRO-CTCAE items and their composite scores. Items or composites with ǀρǀ ≥ 0.30 correlation with QLQ-C30 scales were included. Changes in PRO-CTCAE scores and composites were estimated for patients who met or exceeded a 10-point deterioration on the corresponding QLQ-C30 scale. Change scores were computed between baseline and the 3-month timepoint in PRO-TECT, and in the PRO-CTCAE validation study between baseline and a single follow-up visit that occurred between 1 and 7 weeks later. For each PRO-CTCAE item, change scores could range from − 4 to 4; for a composite, change scores could range from − 3 to 3.ResultsChange scores in QLQ-C30 and PRO-CTCAE were available in 406 and 792 patients in PRO-TECT and the validation study, respectively. Across QLQ-C30 scales, the proportion of patients with a 10-point or greater worsening on QLQ-C30 ranged from 15 to 30% in the PRO-TECT data and 13% to 34% in the validation data. Across PRO-CTCAE items, anchor-based meaningful change estimates for deterioration ranged from 0.05 to 0.30 (mean 0.19) in the PRO-TECT data and from 0.19 to 0.53 (mean 0.36) in the validation data. For composites, they ranged from 0.06 to 0.27 (mean 0.17) in the PRO-TECT data and 0.22 to 0.51 (mean 0.37) in the validation data.ConclusionIn both datasets, the minimal meaningful individual-level change threshold for worsening was one point for all items and composite scores.ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT03249090 (AFT-39), NCT02158637 (MC1091)
BackgroundQuality of life (QOL) and functional status are two key outcomes for patients with advanced heart failure (HF). We examined the association of eleven symptoms with QOL and functional status impairment in patients with advanced HF.Methods and resultsThis was a retrospective analysis of baseline data from a multi-center, cluster-randomized controlled trial (NCT01459744) which enrolled patients with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator and advanced HF at high-risk for mortality. Study instruments included the Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire QOL subscale, and the number of activities of daily living (ADL) patients had difficulties with. The study included 413 subjects. In generalized linear models which were adjusted for baseline characteristics, the total number of symptoms was significantly associated with worse QOL, as was the presence of each individual symptom, except constipation. Lack of energy demonstrated the strongest negative association with QOL. Similarly, the total number of symptoms was associated with a higher number of ADL difficulties (i.e., worse functional status). The presence of pain, lack of energy and drowsiness was individually associated with more ADL difficulties.ConclusionAmong patients with advanced HF, a higher number of symptoms and specific individual symptoms were associated with worse QOL and functional status.
PurposeThis longitudinal study evaluates whether the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement and Information System (PROMIS)-16 domains capture average change over time comparable to the PROMIS-29 + 2 and have similar associations with change in overall health rating and two disability indices.MethodsData were collected using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months among individuals reporting chronic low back pain. The analytic sample includes respondents who completed baseline and at least one follow-up assessment (N= 1137). We estimated latent growth models for eight PROMIS domains and compared growth parameters between the PROMIS-16 and PROMIS 29 + 2 with a z-test. Additionally, for each domain, random intercept and slope scores for individuals were computed for the PROMIS-29 + 2 and PROMIS-16 and correlated to estimate concordance. Using growth parameters for physical function and pain interference, we predicted average change in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), the overall health rating, and compared regression coefficients between the PROMIS-16 and PROMIS 29 + 2.ResultsAll growth models fit the data well. Intercept and slope parameters were statistically comparable (p’s > 0.05) in magnitude across all domains between the PROMIS-16 and PROMIS-29 + 2. Correlations between random intercept and slope scores for individuals across domains were high. Additionally, the regression coefficients between slopes for pain interference and physical function and ODI, RMDQ, and overall health rating were statistically comparable (p’s > 0.05) between the PROMIS-16 and PROMIS 29 + 2.ConclusionResults provide between-level support for the longitudinal and predictive validity of the PROMIS-16. Similar average baseline scores and changes over time were observed between PROMIS-16 and PROMIS-29 + 2. Further, average change estimates comparably predicted average change in distal outcomes. This work provides evidence supporting the utility of the PROMIS-16 as a viable, short-profile option for use in clinical and research settings.
Social participation (SP) has been shown to positively impact the mental health of family caregivers. However, a key concern for local authorities is understanding how and to what extent living in a neighborhood with high SP can moderate the psychological burden of caregivers. This study aimed to address this issue. We conducted a multilevel analysis using 17-wave longitudinal data from 33,813 individuals (16,416 men and 17,397 women) aged 50–59 years residing in 2,446 neighborhoods in 2005. We examined how neighborhood SP (NSP) moderated the impact of caregiving on caregivers’ psychological distress (PD), defined as a Kessler (K6) score ≥5. We also incorporated individual SP (ISP) and its interaction with NSP. The results revealed an asymmetric moderation effects of high NSP and ISP on the impact of caregiving on PD, with sex differences. For men, high NSP moderated 73.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 21.3–125.2%) of the impact when it interacted with ISP. Conversely, for women, ISP moderated 31.3% (95% CI: 10.8–51.9%) of the impact when it interacted with high NSP. We obtained similar findings using both the K6 score and a more severe threshold for severe mental disorder (K6 ≥13). These results suggest that high NSP and ISP moderate the psychological impact of caregiving differently for men and women, highlighting the importance of considering the interaction between NSP and ISP when developing policies to support caregivers through enhancing NSP.
In recent years, the online scam industry has experienced massive growth in East and Southeast Asia. What used to be scattered operations largely located in apartments, villas, and hotel rooms mostly in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and the Philippines, began to scale up and move into bigger ‘scam compounds’ hosting dozens of different companies. There is now substantial evidence of thousands of people being deceived and trafficked into scam operations located in these facilities. Many of them fall for fraudulent job advertisements; others are enticed or duped by friends, relatives, or acquaintances; others again have been outright kidnapped. While the media have extensively reported on this new phenomenon, research on the topic remains scarce and misconceptions are common. Drawing from a survey of Chinese victims, complemented by extensive interviews with survivors from China and other countries, this paper aims to move beyond anecdotal reports to present a more systematic assessment of victim backgrounds. In doing so, it makes a case for the need for better, more comprehensive information-sharing to develop a nuanced understanding of the recruitment practices in the sector, which is an essential precondition to deter people from entering the industry and support survivors.
Adolescents in Washington state have grown up with parents legally able to purchase and consume cannabis. In this environment, it is important to determine the role parental cannabis use and parental monitoring plays in adolescents’ cannabis-related beliefs and intentions. Data analyses of online survey data collected from 276 Washington state adolescents (out of the 350 surveyed who answered applicable questions) conducted four years after the first recreational cannabis retailers opened in the state, indicated perceived parental cannabis use was associated with youth’s attitudes and intentions to use cannabis. Parental monitoring was associated with adolescents’ attitudes about cannabis. Adolescents’ perceived closeness to mother served as a protective factor for adolescent cannabis use, unless the mother used cannabis. Instead, closeness to mothers who use cannabis served as a risk factor for youths’ pro-cannabis attitudes and intentions to use cannabis. Overall, the results of the current study indicate that parents serve as a social context from which adolescents learn about cannabis use and its consequences. Implications are discussed in the article.
Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between job satisfaction and subjective well-being, particularly life satisfaction, which aligns with the spillover theory. Moreover, according to the core self-evaluations theory, core self-evaluations are hypothesized to explain the relationship between job and subjective well-being and to have a causal role in job satisfaction and subjective well-being. The aim of the current study was (1) to test these predictions of self-evaluations theory and (2) to investigate the relationship between job satisfaction and subjective well-being. Data from two national, representative longitudinal studies (i.e., the GESIS Panel study and the Swiss Household Panel study) were used. The participants consisted of approximately 20,000 individuals from Switzerland (Swiss Household Panel study) and 5,000 individuals from Germany (GESIS Panel study). A separate series of random intercept cross-lagged panel models revealed that job satisfaction and subjective well-being (except for happiness) were not reciprocally related across all study waves. Moreover, the relationship between job satisfaction and subjective well-being appears to reflect a trait-like property. Finally, core self-evaluations did not account for any part of the relationship between job and subjective well-being, and there was limited evidence that core self-evaluations can predict later subjective well-being. These results provide mixed support for both spillover and segmentation theories, as well as for some predictions of self-evaluations theory.
The social ecological model illustrates the complex relationships between a person and their environment. Reviews of the literature highlight a need to increase our understanding of how social processes affect youth across multiple environmental contexts. We use data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study to test social connections and observant adults in three contexts: neighborhood, school and family; as predictors of wellbeing, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors in a sample of youth. Our findings suggests that social connections in the neighborhood, school, and family are associated with positive youth outcomes. Observant adults in the school and family are associated with greater wellbeing and fewer externalizing symptoms whereas observant adults in the neighborhood was not associated with youth outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of developing spaces where youth feel included, and the positive impact that observant adults in proximal contexts can have on youth. Understanding how social processes operate across contexts can help practitioners create synergy across the most salient contexts that affect youth.
Enhancing the support for inclusive finance in county economies is crucial in achieving the strategic goal of building financial power. Drawing upon the theoretical lens of county-level inclusive financial accessibility, this study examines the effect of the migration experience (ME) of county socialites on their risky financial assets investment (FAI) and the underlying mechanisms. We utilize data sourced from the County Consumption Survey, a nationwide effort by the Department of Sociology of Tsinghua University and the 58 Tongzhen Research Group. Our findings reveal that the ME of county socialites significantly boosts their likelihood of engaging in financial markets. Furthermore, housing inequality factors, such as housing property rights and housing loans, play a moderating role in the impact of individual ME on their FAI. Additionally, the financial concept has a masking effect rather than a mediating effect on the path of the ME affecting FAI. Notably, the promotion effect of ME displays heterogeneity. Specifically, ME has a stronger positive effect on FAI among college-educated groups, members of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and urban hukou residents than on those who have not completed college education, non-CPC members and rural hukou households. In light of these findings, we propose policy recommendations to optimize the distribution of financial services, adjust the housing equality policy, and enhance inclusive financial literacy.
Immigration policy, particularly regarding migrants crossing the US-Mexico border, has been a highly debated topic for years. There is a continued debate on how to maintain national security while protecting the health and dignity of migrants. In this commentary, we argue that the Biden Administration’s “Proclamation on Securing the Border” issued on June 4, 2024, alongside the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Interim Final Rule, poses a significant threat to the health of migrants seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border by forcing more migrants to wait in encampments in border towns. Specifically, migrants are more likely to face increased exposure to disease, mental health effects, and violence as a result of this proclamation. We call for structural policy reform and propose several alternative policies that can be enacted at the regional and national levels to help maintain the health and dignity of migrants while still prioritizing border security.
Programming is needed to strengthen the single mother-adolescent daughter relationship, focusing on needs of both mothers and daughters beyond risk behaviors. In the current study, we assessed for active ingredients of a unique program developed for Black single mothers and their adolescent daughters (12–17 years old)–Building Our Nation’s Daughters (BOND). Our team interviewed five Black single mothers (35–37 years old) and five Black adolescent daughters (12–15 years old) who were involved in BOND. Grounded theory informed our analytic approach. Results indicated the group format and perceived benefits from program participation were key factors promoting BOND retention for mothers and daughters. For mothers alone, feeling a sense of sisterhood with other mothers further promoted their retention. And exercises and activities, coping skills, and other key factors (e.g., other support, food) were the key active ingredients influencing BOND satisfaction. For daughters alone, emotion recognition and regulation skills promoted satisfaction. The unique structure of BOND programming improved Black mother-daughter relationships through primarily parallel factors for mothers and daughters. Crucial logistic items are noted in the discussion for others endeavoring to serve this population.
The present study uses latent class analysis to explore patterns of family communication about health-related topics during early adolescence. Directed parent–child communication is important for early adolescents to make informed health risk decisions, yet not all families discuss all health issues, especially surrounding sensitive topics such as sex and substance use. Participants were 182 seventh-grade students from a rural, low-income county in the Southeastern U.S. (Mage = 12; 49% girls, 48% boys, 2% transgender or another gender; 49% lower socioeconomic status; 34% Latine, 33% White, 23% Black/African American, 2% Asian, 8% another race/ethnicity). Participants self-reported if they had ever discussed 10 health risk topics with their parents: alcohol, cigarettes, e-cigarettes/vaping, marijuana, sex, sexting, condoms/birth control, bullying, sleep, and time spent online. Four latent classes emerged: those who were unlikely to have discussed any topics (“Low—All Topics”, 38.7%); those who were likely to have discussed all topics (“High—All Topics”, 25.2%); those whose communication selectively excluded discussions of sex (“Everything but Sex”, 18.1%); and those who selectively excluded discussions of substance use (“Moderate—Low Substance”, 18.1%). Adolescents’ gender and sexual experience were related to class membership; their socioeconomic status and substance use experience were not. Results highlight that health risk family communication patterns are not one-size-fits-all. Understanding pluralistic patterns of parent-child health risk communication can inform interventions to promote effective parent communication.
Political (as opposed to professional) election oversight is one area in which the U.S. scores extremely low in measures of election integrity. Meanwhile, rancorous political battles to determine acceptable election procedures and judge when tactics cross the line have become common events. Our work contributes to recent scholarship investigating whether voters prioritize democratic principles or strategically favor electoral procedures that provide partisan advantage. In two survey experiments, we confirm that Americans’ attitudes about antidemocratic election tactics reveal more about which team they are cheering for than they do about whether the tactics are fraudulent. The tendency to engage in partisan motivated reasoning occurs among all partisans, but there are subtle differences as to when citizens will engage in it. Partisan motivated reasoning is more common when actions cause harm and by the partisans that are harmed. Finally, Independents are more impartial, but less likely to call out improper tactics in the aggregate because they often fail to condemn actions by either party.

Four latent classes emerged: those who were unlikely to have discussed any topics (“Low—All Topics”, 38.7%); those who were likely to have discussed all topics (“High—All Topics”, 25.2%); those whose communication selectively excluded discussions of sex (“Everything but Sex”, 18.1%); and those who selectively excluded discussions of substance use (“Moderate—Low Substance”, 18.1%). Adolescents’ gender and sexual experience were related to class membership; their socioeconomic status and substance use experience were not. Results highlight that health risk family communication patterns are not one-size-fits-all. Understanding pluralistic patterns of parent-child health risk communication can inform interventions to promote effective parent communication.
This study investigates the impact of extended unemployment on the life satisfaction of young adults, focusing on social exclusion and loneliness as mediators, with parental socioeconomic status as a moderator. Youth unemployment poses significant economic, psychological, and social challenges. Despite increased awareness, there is still a research gap in understanding the pathways through which extended unemployment affects well-being, particularly the mechanisms of social exclusion and loneliness, and the role of parental socioeconomic status. Using data from the 2022 Seoul Youth Panel Survey and structural equation modeling, this study found that both social exclusion and loneliness significantly mediate the negative relationship between extended unemployment and life satisfaction. The indirect effect mediating through loneliness is stronger than the effect through social exclusion, emphasizing the importance of addressing emotional well-being. Additionally, different types of unemployment have distinct effects: young adults in informal or part-time employment report higher life satisfaction than those formally unemployed, suggesting that employment type significantly influences well-being outcomes. Parental socioeconomic status reduces the negative impact of unemployment, acting as a socioeconomic buffer reinforcing social inequalities. These findings highlight the complex effects of extended unemployment, underscoring the need to address both social and emotional consequences. Understanding these pathways and moderating factors provides insight into mitigating the broader impacts of youth unemployment on well-being.
Work-related psychological health and professional burnout are significant concerns among clergy across various denominations and cultures. This study examines the impact of meaning in life, assessed by the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and emotional intelligence, assessed by the Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale, on work-related psychological health among 198 Roman Catholic priests in Indonesia (84 diocesan priests and 114 religious priests). The psychological health of the participants was measured using the two scales of the Francis Burnout Inventory. The results indicated that higher levels of emotional intelligence enhanced work-related psychological health by both reducing negative affect (emotional exhaustion in ministry) and increasing positive affect (satisfaction in ministry). These findings suggest that evaluating emotional intelligence in candidates for ordained ministry and incorporating emotional intelligence training into priesthood formation programs could help reduce the risk of burnout and enhance overall well-being among priests.
Relying on psychoanalytic, philosophical, and pastoral concepts, this article begins by analyzing and describing the noxious masculinity of slavers in Daniel Black’s 2015 novelThe Coming. This foray helps understand the relentlessness of white male brutality and indifference and the slavers’ fear and hatred of human precarity, vulnerability, and dependency. The second part of the article entails understanding the resilience and resistance of enslaved persons in the face of routine and repeated assaults on their bodies, minds, and relationships. There is, in bare life, something—an excess—that cannot be extinguished except through death. This excess can be understood as ungovernable selves and is evident in acts of resistance and resilience to the warped masculinity of the slavers.
The age pension aims to assist eligible elderly Australians who meet specific age and residency criteria in maintaining basic living standards. In designing efficient pension systems, government policymakers seek to satisfy the expectations of the overall aging population in Australia. However, the population’s unique demographic characteristics at the state and territory level are often overlooked due to the lack of available data. We use the Hamilton-Perry model, which requires minimum input, to model and forecast the evolution of age-specific populations at the state and territory level. We also integrate the obtained sub-national demographic information to determine sustainable pension ages up to 2051. We also investigate pension welfare distribution in all states and territories to identify the disadvantaged residents under the current pension system. Using the sub-national mortality data for Australia from 1971 to 2021 obtained from AHMD (2023), we implement the Hamilton-Perry model with the help of functional time series forecasting techniques. With the forecasts of age-specific population sizes for each state and territory, we compute the old age dependency ratio to determine the nationwide sustainable pension age.
The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Healthy Aging framework describes healthy aging as the maintenance of functional capacity in older adults. However, aging is a heterogeneous process influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors, leading to variations in experiences of functional capacity among adults. In this study, Latent Class Analysis (LCA) classified groups of individuals based on their health and functional capacities. Adults from Northwest Ethiopia (n = 845) aged ≥ 60 years old, were interviewed about their cognition, mental health, social support, independence, and sensory functioning. LCA identified three groups, reflecting “high-“ (47.5%); "moderate-" (37.3%); and "low-functioning" (15.2%) participants. Compared to low-functioning individuals, high-functioning individuals were less likely to be aged 80+ (RR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.80), lonely (RR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.72, 3.18), but more likely to report normal nutritional status (RR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.47, 2.86), no multimorbidity (RR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.32), living in an urban area (RR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.22), and financially independent (RR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.49). Notably, almost half of the sample was classified as high functioning, comparable to findings from other developing countries. Those individuals in the high-functioning group who did not meet the WHO criteria for functional capacity across all domains did not differ from those individuals who did meet all the WHO criteria. This positively demonstrates that older adults do not need to be functional across all dimensions to experience healthy aging.
This research aims to establish how systems thinking (ST) can be used to develop firm competitive capabilities (CC) and improve firm performance (FP). The focus is on ST applications in the South African information and communications technology (ICT) industry. The methodology includes Structural text condensation of relevant literature combined with interviews involving a selection of participants. From the analysis, some of the key findings are that ST enables the firm to contextualize itself in the wider systems environment, which results in improvements in FP. The research stream is specifically on soft ST and its contribution to improvements in firm CC and FP. This research creates an opportunity for further research into how soft ST can be leveraged in delivering firm CC and improvements in FP. The theoretical contribution made in this paper is exploring the relationship/linkage between the different concepts of soft ST, CC and FP.
The purpose of this qualitative, phenomenological study was to understand early childhood teachers’ perceptions surrounding the topic of childhood scribbles as they relate to emergent literacy. Sociocultural theory provided a foundation for this research because of its focus on relationships between children, other children, and teachers to foster learning experiences. Additionally, social semiotic theory also guided this research because childhood scribbles represent children’s “signs” which can also influence communication and literacy skills. The participants were nine preschool, transitional kindergarten, kindergarten, and first grade teachers (N = 9) who volunteered to complete an open-ended survey, follow-up interviews, and a short survey before and after participating in a “Scribbles Workshop”. This study was guided by a central research question: What are early childhood teachers’ perceptions of children’s scribbling in the classroom environment, with regard to emergent literacy? Findings highlight an overarching theme: Scribbling promotes student and teacher interaction, which is critical to increased emergent literacy. A “Scribbling Interaction Cycle” is interpreted from the data and instances where teachers mentioned the importance of the student and teacher interacting to obtain meaning. Fourteen additional themes are presented which correspond to each explored construct. Findings are discussed and implications are given which relate to improved teacher education at the university level, policy changes at the state and national level, and revising kindergarten and first grade English language arts standards to include developmentally appropriate guidelines.
ObjectiveIn recent decades, electronic monitoring (EM) has increasingly come to be used as an alternative to incarceration. However, EM’s long-term effects on offenders remain unclear, especially with regard to non-recidivism-related outcomes and reincarceration risks. This study focuses on the long-term impact of EM on recidivism, mortality, and labor market exclusion.MethodThe study utilizes administrative data, and focuses on a Swedish EM reform as a natural experiment with a difference-in-difference approach. The reform enabled offenders sentenced to up to six months’ imprisonment to serve their sentences under EM instead of in prison.ResultsThe findings show that introducing the possibility to transform a prison stay to EM at home reduced 10-year reconviction and reincarceration rates. They also show that the reform had long-lasting decreasing effect on the likelihood of not being in education, employment, or training (NEET). The reform had, however, no effect on all-cause mortality or death by suicide. Heterogeneity analyses show that the effects are primarily driven by individuals who had a more stable labor market attachment prior to being sentenced to prison, which suggests that EM helps offenders sustain regular employment and that it decreases the criminogenic impact of labor market detachment.ConclusionIn addition to reducing the costs associated with recidivism and labor market exclusion, the reduced incarceration costs associated with transforming prison sentences to EM indicate that EM has the potential to produce net savings from a societal perspective.
Scholars of civic and political participation have been puzzled by questions of disengagement among socially, economically, and politically marginalized groups. Drawing on 32 in-depth interviews with long-time Black residents of San Francisco’s historic Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood, this analysis examines the factors that influence the civic participation choices of residents. By employing conceptual tools from previous studies of civic participation, this article demonstrates how local opportunities and constraints influence civic attitudes and behaviors. The narratives offered by residents in this study reveal that civic participation is not a fixed practice but instead a dynamic process of adapting political attitudes and behaviors to evolving environmental conditions. These findings present a micro-level account of the effects of political exclusion and disadvantage on civic engagement practices and hold important implications for our approaches to broadly mobilizing perceivably disengaged populaces.
Despite Australian and New Zealand Universities pledging to address gender inequities, the patriarchal history of universities continues to impact the careers of women in academia. Under-representation of women in senior leadership and a culture of masculinity can lead to a lack of resources for feminist leadership and a devaluing of women’s work. We investigate how women in academic leadership are playing the game differently, making strategic moves to navigate leadership in the neoliberal neopatriarchal academy. We explored the experiences of 22 women in academic leadership through online qualitative surveys and reflexive thematic analysis of the data, taking inspiration from Bourdieu’s work on habitus and doxa. Although women leaders were able to successfully make strategic moves to advance their careers, these were shaped by parenting status, race, culture, and age. The women’s leadership approaches were counter to the masculine doxa of the academic field, leading instead relationally. We do not suggest that there is a specific ‘female’ style of academic leadership, but that successful authentic leadership can be founded on a feminist ethics of care in contrast to neopatriarchy. Adoption of such approaches across the academy might unshackle academics across genders from their positioning in academic leadership hierarchies.
Two studies examined the effects of race on thethink manager-think maleeffect, which has shown men in general to be viewed more similarly to successful managers than women in general. The first study directly manipulated the race of the male or female target in the think manager-think-male framework and examined the effects on two key measures of agency – competence and assertiveness – as well as on communality. Results indicated that the differences in agency characterizations between men and successful managers and women and successful managers that are emblematic of the think-manager-think-male effect were not always evident. While the think manager-think male effect was observed for men and women “in general” as well as for men and women designated as White, it did not hold for Black and Asian targets, whose characterizations were influenced not only by gender stereotypes but also by racial stereotypes. Additionally, a potential “think manager-thinkfemale” effect, as indicated by greater overlap in communality ratings between women in general and successful managers than between men in general and successful managers held for targets who were White and Black, but not for those who were Asian. A follow-up study focused on potential implications of the findings from the first study and indicated that competence was believed to be more important than either communality or assertiveness, while communality was believed to be more important than assertiveness in determining managerial success. These results raise questions about the universality of the think-manager-think-male effect and the scope of its generalizability. These findings also add to the growing concern about the precision and application of gender bias research findings when attention is not paid to crucial intersecting identities such as race.
Despite considerable attention in the academic domain, end-users of transport systems are rarely directly asked what they think of gender inequity in transport. Shedding light on this could inform education strategies to address such inequities. This research addresses this research gap, revealing how people think about differences in the way transport systems support (or do not support) the safe and comfortable mobility of men and women. It does so via the use of asynchronous online focus groups, to which 114 people contributed. The research also addresses questions around the impact of focus group gender composition on participants’ responses, an issue not previously considered in online or asynchronous contexts. Results suggest there is broad acceptance of women’s transport disadvantage, with men’s views of women’s experiences largely matching women’s own reports. Women’s views of men’s experiences were less reflective of the male reality. Safety and security were commonly discussed; however, trip complexity and other constraints, driven by differences in care roles taken, were discussed less and therefore represent a potential avenue for education strategies. Group gender composition did impact upon responding, with several of the effects previously found in face-to-face focus group research also manifesting in the anonymous, online context.
COVID-19 mandates required residential youth care providers to quickly adapt services while adhering to state and local mandates, impacting family visitation, stress, and potential disruption to reunification efforts. This mixed-methods study utilized data from a larger study of residential group homes in one southeastern state, utilizing the Quality Standards Assessment (QSA). First, utilizing open-ended responses on the QSA, a content analysis was used to explore residential care providers’ challenges and responses during COVID-19. Next, descriptive statistics and trend charts were utilized to explore quality differences in programs pre-, during, and post-COVID-19. The qualitative data reflected that COVID-19 presented significant challenges to residential care providers, including impacts on family and community engagement, programmatic procedures, education, and the residential care workforce. Responses to challenges included creating activities on-campus, conducting family visits virtually, shifting to on-campus schooling, and conducting re-licensing inspections virtually. The quantitative analysis showed mean quality rating trends dropping during the pandemic, with some quality ratings improving post-pandemic. Moreover, trends in mean incident reports increased during and post-pandemic years. Residential programs adapted to challenges, while some gaps remained. Issues with school and being isolated from family and community, as well as an increase in incident reports, were experienced among youth within residential care during COVID-19. Post-pandemic incident reports underscore the potential long-term impacts of COVID-19 on residential group care.
PurposeTo present EQ-5D-5L population norms for the general adult population in Alberta, Canada.MethodsWe analyzed data from 11 population-based surveys conducted in Alberta between 2012 and 2021. By applying appropriate sampling weights, we estimated normative data for the EQ-5D-5L dimensions, index scores, and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. This analysis was conducted for the overall population as well as for subgroups categorized by age, sex, provincial health zones, and 17 chronic conditions.ResultsThe analysis included data from 60,447 respondents (ages 18–99; 51.4% female) across various survey waves, revealing minimal variations in sample characteristics and EQ-5D-5L scores over time. The most frequently reported problems were pain/discomfort (62.2%) and anxiety/depression (41.7%), while 22.5% of respondents reported no issues on any dimension. The mean (SD) EQ-5D-5L index score was 0.845 (0.137), and the mean EQ VAS score was 77.4 (16.7). There was a notable increase in the proportion of reported problems across all dimensions with age, except for anxiety/depression, which showed a decline with advancing age. Females reported slightly more problems across all dimensions compared to males. Individuals with chronic pain had the lowest EQ-5D-5L index scores, followed by those with anxiety and depression, while the lowest EQ VAS scores were observed in individuals with congestive heart failure, kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.ConclusionThis study provides EQ-5D-5L norms for the adult population in Alberta. These reference values can be used to benchmark patients’ outcomes as well as to establish burden of illness in this population and facilitate the interpretation of EQ-5D-5L scores in various applications.
As migrant integration policies touch upon almost all spheres of citizens’ life, collaboration across policy levels as well as across policy domains is needed. Over time, a series of both policy and analytical paradigms on the integration of migrants emerged, going from the traditional ideas of differentialism and assimilation, over multiculturalism, interculturalism, integrationism, liberal egalitarianism and mainstreaming, up to superdiversity and intersectionality. While networks for integration policies are likely to be at least partly driven by these paradigms, recent studies seem to nuance this assumption based on so called paradigmatic pragmatism, meaning that cities draw on a variety of ideas and pragmatically combine them under the header of diversity policies. The need for multi-level and multi-actor governance on migrant integration, the theoretical knowledge about homophily in organizational networks, and the recent findings on paradigmatic pragmatism, raise the question to what extent collaboration between public and non-profit organizations active around migrant integration is based on a shared policy paradigm on the integration of migrants. This question is answered based on a multiple case study of four central cities in Flanders (Belgium), covering 1.403 organizations. In the quantitative and qualitative (social network) analyses, comparisons along both the axes of cities and policy domains are made. Findings contribute to literature on organizational homophily, showing that clustering of organizations is likely to be at least partly driven by policy paradigm on integration. This is however nuanced by the observation that policy paradigms appear to be ambiguous, which in turn reveals opportunities for more flexible collaborations between actors and for avoiding deadlocks in policy making.
Do people think that some policies should be handled by the states, rather than the national government? In an era characterized by stark party polarization there is reason to suspect that attitudes regarding federalism are shaped by partisan considerations. Specifically, reported support for devolution may be driven by exposure to elite partisan cues and partisan reasoning tied to which political party devolution would empower. Using data from the 2022 Cooperative Election Study, we find that partisans tend to differ—often substantially—in their support for state-level decision-making regarding concrete policy proposals. However, these differences are largely driven by those who are most likely to be exposed to elite cues. We also find that, among both Democrats and Republicans, support for policy devolution is contingent on which party controls the state legislature in an individual’s state. The findings suggest that partisanship plays a central role in shaping what the public says when asked about which level of government should determine whether to implement specific policy proposals.
The term ‘parentification’ describes role-reversed family processes when children provide care to their parents and family. Given the fact that race and ethnicity are among the least considered factors in the past research on parentification, the purpose of this phenomenological study was to understand the lived experiences of parentification of young Asian American adults within their sociocultural context using the contextual therapy theory. Eight individuals (five identified as Hmong, two as lu Mien, and one as Filipino), seven females and one male, ages ranging from 24 to 29, participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis from which the predominant themes of early and extensive parentification experiences as children of immigrant parents, strong influences of cultural expectations, and lost childhood and identity emerged. Furthermore, the study participants complied with gender-based cultural role expectations to help their families survive. Clinical implications and study limitations are discussed.

In recent decades, job quitting has surged in Chinese society, reflecting notable changes in economic structure and social mindset. Meanwhile, more workers across various industries hold higher educational qualifications than their jobs require, a phenomenon known as over-education. This mismatch between education and job requirements may negatively influence work commitment and career outlook, potentially triggering risks to societal efficiency. Inspired by this scenario, this study investigates job mobility intentions through the lens of job mismatches, focusing on how over-education experience influences employees’ intentions to quit, along with the social–psychological mechanisms underlying this relationship. Using data from the 2018 China Labor Force Dynamics Survey, the analysis applies logistic regression, propensity score matching, and the Karlson–Holm–Breen mediation approach. The results indicate that over-educated employees are more likely to express turnover intentions compared to those whose education matches their job requirements. Job satisfaction significantly mediates the relationship between over-education and turnover intentions, revealing causes such as unfulfilled job expectations and negative work attitudes that lead mismatched employees to consider leaving. Additionally, dissatisfaction regarding promotion opportunities plays a more significant mediating role than dissatisfaction with income, suggesting that long-term career development concerns outweigh short-term financial incentives for many employees. This study offers an updated cross-industry explanation for the social mindset of job quitting compared to the previous individual- or organization-level perspectives. The empirical findings contribute to career mobility theory by demonstrating how individuals engage in compromised strategies for upward mobility in a society with constrained opportunities. The findings also underscore the significance of appropriate job placement and robust promotional systems in fostering positive work attitudes, offering valuable insights into managerial practices.
I develop an equilibrium-matching model with job rationing and endogenous layoffs in order to investigate whether the composition of unemployment (rationing versus frictional) influences the way firing costs affect employment. The model suggests that firing costs lead to a strong adverse employment effect if unemployment is mainly caused by job rationing, whereas in labor markets driven by search frictions firing costs have only a negligible impact on employment. The paper tests this hypothesis using data on the adoption of wrongful-dismissal laws adopted by U.S. state courts during the 1970s and 1980s. Results indicate that for two of the three wrongful-dismissal laws investigated, unemployment composition is crucial for the induced employment effects.
In this paper, we use data from the ‘Families and Social Subjects’ survey conducted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics in 2016 to study the impact of micro- and macro-level economic conditions on first co-residential union formation. We aim to determine if and to what extent the probability of forming the first union is explained by individual labour market positions (e.g. having non-standard employment or not having work), and additionally explore if adverse macroeconomic conditions also play a role. We differentiate by union type—marriage and cohabitation—known to be characterised by different levels of union commitment. We also address potential gender differences by conducting separate analyses on men and women. Our results suggest that while micro- and macro-level economic factors matter in the union formation process, their effect varies by gender and union type. Individual economic vulnerability has a greater impact on marriage than on cohabitation for both men and women. Instead, contextual economic uncertainty plays a relevant role, especially in the transition to cohabitation, regardless of gender, and, to a lesser extent, in the transition to marriage, but only for women.
U.S. females live longer than males due to a range of social, psychological, behavioral, and health factors. Prior research has underscored unhealthy behaviors as particularly risky for males and lower socioeconomic status as a risk factor for females in shaping sex differences in adult mortality. But this research has largely examined mortality during mid- and older-adulthood, with most deaths occurring at older ages. Our study focuses on sex differences in mortality among a cohort of U.S. adolescents followed into adulthood, ages 12–46 (N= 18,921). We employ Cox proportional hazard models and data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), which was recently linked to mortality records through December of 2021. The hazard of dying is much greater (HR = 1.69;p< .001) for male compared to female adolescents and young adults, with larger disparities for external compared to internal causes of death. Sex differences in mortality are reduced but persist when controlling for childhood experiences, health behaviors, risky behaviors, and social ties. The relatively poor mental and physical health of females suppresses the differences; that is, sex differences in mortality would be even larger were it not for the poorer mental and physical health of young females compared with males. The findings point to risk factors that if improved could reduce mortality for both U.S. males and females, while reducing sex differences in mortality among younger adults. Such improvements could increase life expectancy of the U.S. population and reduce mortality and sex differences at older ages.
The present study focuses joint school and university development work in preschool-projects try to increase educational quality. The aim of this study was to explore perceived conditions and perceptions of projects among participants in development projects in eleven preschools. In addition, we were interested in the perceived outcomes of the projects. All projects were aimed at strengthening the preschool principal’s and staff’s competence regarding children’s language and emergent literacy development. The studied projects lasted up to three years. The results are based on phenomenographical analyses of thirteen focus group interviews with principals and staff, including eighty-eight participants, during the project period. Follow-up interviews were conducted with twenty-four representatives from the participating preschools one year after the closure of the projects. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed. Field notes from visits in the preschools contributed to the empirical material. Our findings indicate that the perceptions of a project, contributed to the understanding of a project as loaded with expectations that the development project is limited in time and that it will add extra-curricular work demanding extra resources, which led to the perception that when the project is over, development work is over. The word project, thus, per se functioned as a limiting factor, if on-going development work, was aimed for. Lack of anchoring the development work in the local context was perceived as problematic, with effects for the participants’ experience of agency. Furthermore, difficulties in managing large staff turnover during the project was perceived to cause the development work to come to a stand-still. Active leadership, and shared responsibility were perceived as favorable factors for the progress of the development work. Our conclusions encompass participants’ perceptions of adjustment to the local context, shared responsibility and seeing development work as exceeding time limits as vital components of successful development work.
This research examines whether employees’ perceptions of service climate are related to organizational performance oriented toward improving the quality of life (QoL) of people with intellectual disability (ID) through the mediation of service quality perceived by family members. The research was conducted in 252 centers for people with ID in Spain. Employees (N= 2.021) reported on service climate. Family members (N= 2.267) reported on service quality and organizational performance oriented toward improving QoL. We used an overall measure of service climate. Service quality was composed of two dimensions: functional (efficiency in the delivery of the core service) and relational (quality of the social interaction between employees and service users beyond the core service) service quality. Organizational performance oriented toward QoL was composed of four dimensions: overall QoL; self-determination; social inclusion; and defense of rights of people with ID. Results supported full mediation, with functional and relational service quality mediating the relationship between service climate and performance oriented toward improving QoL. Implications for research and organizations are also discussed.
In examining visa-waiver agreements, previous studies have primarily focused on economic motivations and effects. In this article, we explore the potential political motivations and consequences. Particularly, we propose that there is a positive relationship between visa-waivers and democracy. We test this using a global dataset that records bilateral travel visa requirements for all countries between 1973 and 2013. We find support for our main hypothesis. We also examine the relationship between democracy, visa waivers and economic development. Contrary to our expectations, we find that democracy continues to exert influence on visa waivers even at high levels of income. Non-democracies fail to attain visa waivers even when they are wealthy. Finally, we explore whether visa waivers could have an impact on individuals’ attitudes towards democracy. Using survey data from 18 Latin American countries, we find suggestive evidence that that visa-waivers can have a positive impact on individuals’ democratic attitudes. Taken together, the findings suggest that democracy and visa-waivers might have a mutually reinforcing relationship.
The present study aimed to investigate hostile and benevolent sexist experiences of women in Turkey. We translated and adapted the Experiences with Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (EASI) and the Experiences with Benevolent Sexism Scale (EBSS) to the Turkish culture, which has higher average rates of sexism than the U.S., where the scales were originally developed. Three samples of college women (Ns = 245, 455, and 555) rated the frequencies of EASI and EBSS events. We also assessed participants’ psychological well-being (i.e., life satisfaction, self-esteem, self-efficacy), aspirations, and ambivalent sexist attitudes. The findings provide preliminary support for the construct validity of the scales in a Turkish context, demonstrating that the EASI and EBSS measure benevolent experiences (i.e., protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy) and EASI also assesses hostile experiences (i.e., hostile sexism and heterosexual hostility). More frequent experiences of hostile sexism, protective paternalism, and complementary gender differentiation were related to lower levels of well-being, whereas heterosexual hostility and heterosexual intimacy were related to higher levels of well-being. Heterosexual hostility and heterosexual intimacy were also related to higher extrinsic aspirations. Participants rated benevolent experiences as more frequent but less distressing than hostile ones. Overall, these findings indicate that ambivalent sexist experiences are significant for women’s psychological wellbeing and aspirations.
There are sharp U.S. political differences in transgender attitudes, with liberals expressing much more favorable attitudes and support for trans-inclusive policies than conservatives. Transgender attitudes likely contribute to numerous public policies that are being passed or considered, including policies that impact transgender health, safety, and well-being. Thus, it is imperative to understand why vast partisan differences in transgender attitudes occur. Here we present two preregistered studies examining whether transgender knowledge (i.e., knowledge about transgender identities, experiences, causes, and health care) differs in Democrats versus Republicans, and whether knowledge mediates political differences in attitudes and policy support (N= 439, Prolific). Participants completed a transgender quiz, followed by measures of transgender prejudice and support for trans-inclusive policies. Democrats had superior transgender knowledge compared to Republicans (ds > 1.39). Further, as predicted, transgender knowledge significantly mediated political differences in transgender prejudice and policy support. Exploratory analyses found that the predicted mediation effects held when knowledge was operationalized in different ways and after adjusting for demographic covariates. These data suggest that knowledge gaps help to explain political differences in transgender attitudes and may stimulate additional work on how to improve such knowledge.
Since the 1980s, there has been a steady increase in the inequality of health-related quality of life in China. However, there has been no reliable evaluation of recent trends, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. To bridge the knowledge gap, we analyzed current trends in educational inequality in health-related quality of life and explored potential causes. According to the Zhejiang Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Program (n= 55,560) and the Recentered Influence Function decomposition method, we found that although the health-related quality of life has remained relatively stable over the past two decades, health inequality has risen. Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the already existing inequality in mental health has worsened significantly. Further analysis indicated that the group with the lowest education level might contribute to the rapid increase in mental health inequality during the epidemic due to their inability to obtain a relatively stable income. Our study highlights the necessity of social policies to curb the rise of inequality in health-related quality of life.
People tend to be less happy in cities than in rural areas, the so called “urban–rural happiness gradient.” The recent covid19 pandemic allows us to explore one of the disadvantages of large and dense cities: the faster spread of infectious diseases. Using the World Values Survey, we find a large differential, or effect size, pre v during pandemic for cities versus smaller areas—cities became two times less happy during the pandemic versus pre-pandemic compared to smaller areas. In absolute terms, while .2 to .5 difference on a 1–10 SWB scale is not large, given the massive scale of urbanization, the practical effect in the population is large. As in any non-experimental research, causality may not be present. The results from Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Uruguay studied here may not generalize to other countries, especially ones with much different covid19 rates, policy responses, and urbanization patterns.
What is the relationship, indeed what is the interface, between disappearing biological groups of plants and animals and disappearing human cultural groups? Hardly more than a generation ago, the question itself would have been considered academically abstruse, even gauche. Today, in the high era of the Anthropocene with the natural world facing a sixth extinction, and traditional ethno-social groups founded on living relationships to niche eco-systems diminishing before our eyes, the question is more than urgent. This piece explores around the edges of this conundrum, “edges” or more precisely historic “rimlands” comprising a discrete yet “normal” eastern European and Aegean world of rich, ethnographic communities and interactions between communities across thelongue durée, shattered not just by forces of extreme violence but also by a seemingly ineluctable nation-state-driven developmentalism. Might we consider the relentless and ostensibly irresistible “perturbations” of modernity which in the process consigned whole elements of a rich human mosaic to the marginalisation of “minority” status, through the prism of global, omnicidal forces which are bringing the entire biosphere to the brink of catastrophe? If this is the case, the struggle for human difference and biological diversity suggests a common cause, and a common solidarity.
A surge in publications on climate change vulnerability and risk assessments in recent years reflects the escalating impacts of climate change. These assessments are crucial for improving climate change adaptation planning. City-level integrated climate risk and vulnerability assessments (CRVAs) are increasingly relevant, particularly for African cities facing heightened vulnerability from local climate impacts and urbanization. There are several practical challenges in the context of Sub-Saharan African cities: 1) research capacity limitations; 2) the heterogeneity of settlements and their infrastructure; 3) data availability and accessibility; and 4) inclusion of local knowledge in the data collection process. This study aims to address these challenges through an integrated quick-scan CRVA approach. The methodology was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to be conducted on distance with local partners, and tested through an instrumental case study in Kampala, Uganda. The case of Kampala shows the execution and resulting scan, with mapped districts where climate threats are urgent, summarized in so-called ‘neighbourhood profiles’. The method description and its implementation demonstrate that this form of CRVA methodology holds the potential to: (a) expedite city-wide climate assessments; (b) provide a filter procedure and a classification of diverse needs across districts; (c) bring together ‘insider knowledge’ and ‘outsider expertise’ and (d) establish knowledge collaborations across distances and scales. In just a few months’ time, the project team navigated in both informal community systems and formal institutional frameworks. Preferable to the alternative of complete absence of vulnerability assessments, the described ‘quick-scan method’ may be worthwhile for other African cities.
Misogynistic attitudes have surged in the past few years and the “manosphere” – an online milieu promoting toxic and rigid masculinity norms – is often seen as an arena for spreading such ideas. Within the manosphere, manfluencers (i.e., male influencers who espouse misogynistic content and beliefs) are known for trying to persuade men to view women and feminism as a threat to their masculinity and status as men. In this article, we examine how perceived threats to masculine identity as presented by manfluencers affect the formation of young men’s attitudes towards women. In an original survey (N= 2857) with Swedish men, we found that young men who follow more manfluencers are more likely to dehumanize women. In two experiments (N= 597, 630), we presented potentially threatening content from a fictive manfluencer to a group of participants and found that young men exposed to such content were more mistrustful of women and misogynistic, especially if they felt like they had been rejected by women in the past. The results highlight the importance of how social media influencers may increase misogyny among young men. This research has important implications for policymakers and practitioners, who should be made aware of the role manfluencers have in the formation of attitudes toward gender equality.
Marx’s labor theory of value has often been criticized by environmentalists, ecological economists, and even leftist theorists. They argue that Marx infinitely exalts the contribution of labor to value for the purpose of celebrating the working class, without reserving any place for nature in his theory of value and without recognizing the intrinsic value of nature. This critique portrays Marx as an anthropocentrist and a speciesist. In fact, this prejudice against Marx is based on a misunderstanding of his labor theory of value. First, Marx’s labor theory of value reveals the dual properties of value and its various sources; it regards nature and labor (concrete labor) as the source of all wealth. Second, Marx’s labor theory of value reveals how capitalist production causes the dual alienation of man and nature as well as the problem of irreversible environmental degradation. Finally, the labor theory of value helps us understand Marx’s path of ecological liberation aimed at abolishing capitalism’s alienating labor and value system.
Studies of voting behavior in some settings may be hampered by poor data availability or unsuitably large units of aggregation for reported turnout. We propose and demonstrate a practical big-data solution to these kinds of challenges, using fine-grained cell-phone mobility data on millions of GPS locations for more than 300,000 eligible voters in Tokyo. Our approach uses the geolocations of polling stations, combined with GPS data points recorded on election day and a reference day, to measure patterns in individual-level (but anonymized) voting behavior. We first test the validity of the measure by comparing it to official aggregated data on turnout, and then illustrate its substantive utility with an application exploring the well-known relationship between turnout decisions and the cost of voting, proxied by the distance between a voter’s residence and the polling station. Finally, we discuss the potential limitations of the approach and provide step-by-step instructions for other researchers.
BackgroundUnderstanding health-related quality of life (HRQoL) dynamics is essential for assessing and improving treatment experiences; however, clinical and observational studies struggle to capture their full complexity. We use simulation modeling and the case of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy—a type of cancer immunotherapy that can prolong survival, but carries life-threatening risks—to study HRQoL dynamics.MethodsWe developed an exploratory system dynamics model with mathematical equations and parameter values informed by literature and expert insights. We refined its feedback structure and evaluated its dynamic behavior through iterative interviews. Model simulated HRQoL from treatment approval through six months post-infusion. Two strategies—reducing the delay to infusion and enhancing social support—were incorporated into the model. To dynamically evaluate the effect of these strategies, we developed four metrics: post-treatment HRQoL decline, recovery time to pre-treatment HRQoL, post-treatment HRQoL peak, and durability of the peak.ResultsModel captures key interactions within HRQoL, providing a nuanced analysis of its continuous temporal dynamics, particularly physical well-being, psychological well-being, tumor burden, receipt and efficacy of treatment, side effects, and their management. Model analysis shows reducing infusion delays enhanced HRQoL across all four metrics. While enhanced social support improved the first three metrics for patients who received treatment, it did not change durability of the peak.ConclusionsSimulation modeling can help explore the effects of strategies on HRQoL while also demonstrating the dynamic interactions between its key components, offering a powerful tool to investigate aspects of HRQoL that are difficult to assess in real-world settings.
Lifetime gambling activities and behaviors are considered as potentially addictive behaviors that may impact a student’s performance. According to a survey conducted in Tanzanian’s higher training institutions, for example, 37.2% of sports gamblers were students. This study employed an institutional-based cross-sectional survey in a quantitative research approach to study 374 randomly sampled undergraduate students in higher training institutions in Dodoma region, Tanzania from June to July 2023. Students reported their attitudes, practices, and drivers of gambling activities through interviewer-administered structured questionnaires adopted from previous studies. Results indicate that 374 of 583 potential participants were eligible and surveyed for the study with 100% response rate. Participants’ mean age was 24 years ± 2.79 of which, few of them (34%) had age ranging between 25 and 42 years. Male participants accounted for 69.8% (n = 261). 59.1% of the study participants believed that gambling activities were okay to them of which 47.3% of them were lifetime gamblers; 19.2% moderate-risk lifetime gamblers and 2.5% low-risk lifetime gamblers respectively. Online sports betting (44.5%), coin pusher (29.4%), poll tables (8.0%), and slot machines (6.9%) were the most preferred types of gambling games among students. Age between 17 and 24 years; levels three and four classes, being male; living off-campus; drug abuse; mobile smartphone ownership; exposure to social media platforms and high attitude towards gambling activities were associated significantly with undergraduate students’ gambling practices (p< 0.05). Large-scale institutional-based educational programs about the financial and academic ramifications of gambling among students during their studies may be able to moderate their gambling behaviors.
PurposeThis study aimed to examine the trajectory in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during and after hospitalisation for worsening of heart failure (HF) in Malaysia.Methods200 patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) admitted into two hospitals in Malaysia due to worsening of HF were surveyed using the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire. The primary outcomes were utility values at admission, discharge and 1-month post-discharge (1MPD). Secondary outcomes included the visual analogue scores (VAS) and the proportion of patients reporting each EQ-5D-5 L dimension levels. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation, and generalised linear mixed models were fitted.ResultsAt admission, the unadjusted mean utility values and VAS scores for HFrEF patients in Malaysia were as low as 0.150 ± 0.393 and 38.2 ± 20.8, respectively. After a median hospital stay of 4 days, there was a significant improvement in utility values and VAS scores by 0.510 (95% CI: 0.455–0.564) and 28.8 (95% CI: 25.5–32.1), respectively. The utility value and VAS score at 1-month post-discharge were not significantly different from discharge. The proportion of HFrEF patients reporting problems and severe problems in mobility, self-care, usual activities, and anxiety/depression, pain/discomfort reduced at varying degree from admission to discharge and 1MPD.ConclusionHF is a progressive condition with substantial variation in HRQoL during the disease trajectory. During hospitalisation due to worsening of HF, HFrEF population has unfavourable HRQoL. Rapid and significant HRQoL improvement was observed at discharge, which sustained over one month. The study findings can inform future cost-effectiveness analyses and policies.
If we can agree that American democracy is backsliding, the question arises: How do we fix it, or at a minimum, reverse the most deleterious trends that pervade our current political milieu? The American Founders knew that citizens were not naturally imbued with the sensibilities on which democratic republics are based. In particular, the Founders recognized that “the people” could quickly devolve into “the mob,” that demagogues could come to power by exploiting a democratic society’s internal tensions, and that democratic citizens could be fickle and easily distracted. The system of checks and balances was constructed with these challenges in mind. Separating powers across the different branches of government was a deliberate attempt to thwart the worst impulses of demagogues and would-be authoritarians. Their political system is famously slow, messy, and often frustrating, but the Founders hoped these safeguards would prevent American democracy from derailing. The trouble now, however, is that these carefully curated institutions have turned on their host and are empowering and expanding the immoderate and illiberal forces they were intended to sideline. Given the extent of the decay, the kinds of modest institutional changes that generate considerable enthusiasm among democracy advocates and reformers—for instance, ending the Senate filibuster, adding more states to the Union, increasing the size of Congress and the Supreme Court, or term-limiting their members—are unlikely to meet the problem. Tinkering with our institutions distracts from a larger, more fundamental challenge that students of popular regimes have recognized for centuries: without a degree of civic virtue in both the masses and the elites, democracy will not be sustainable. Instead of grasping for institutional tweaks, we first should seek ways to build trust among our fellow citizens and within the political institutions we share. Without a revival of civic virtue to serve as a foundation, institutional reforms are unlikely to relieve what is troubling democracy in America; they may even exacerbate the problem.
PurposeThis study aimed to document utility values and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) with the 5-level version of the EQ-5D questionnaire in a large sample of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).MethodsQALY-MICI was a cross-sectional survey across three sources in France. Data were collected between 2019 and 2022 for patients 18 and over. The EQ-5D-5 L, the EQ-VAS, the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ), the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) for CD, and the Walmsley Index for UC (SCCAI) were collected.ResultsA total of 2,841 patients aged over 18 were recruited (1785 with CD, 1056 with UC). The mean age was 40.2 (SD 14.3). The time since diagnosis was 6 years and over for 61.9% of patients. The most impacted dimensions were usual activities, anxiety/ depression, and pain/ discomfort. The mean utility value was 0.863 (SD 0.172) versus 0.905 (SD 0.158) in the French population (p= 0.007). The mean VAS value was 68 (SD 19.2) versus 73.4 (SD 22.2) in the general population (p= 0.016). Utility values and VAS were similar for CD and UC and higher for men. There was a strong positive correlation between utility values, the VAS, and the SIBDQ score, and a negative correlation between the HBI and the SCCAI. The SIBDQ score and disease activity were the main predictors of utility and VAS.ConclusionThe QALY-MICI is, to our knowledge, the first study documenting utility values and VAS using the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire on a large sample, with a comparison to the general population.
Objectification theory posits that puberty is likely to be a critical stage for experiencing body shame. Past research on experiences during puberty has largely focused on the association between pubertal timing (i.e., the onset of the process of physical maturation and sexual development) and physical and/or psychological health problems among adolescent girls, whereas less research has considered pubertal tempo (i.e., the rate of physical maturation and sexual development during puberty) among girls and boys and its association with body image variables. Using growth curve models, the present study examined whether pubertal tempo and pubertal timing predicted body shame at three equidistant data collection time-points over a two-year period in a sample of 755 early adolescent boys and girls from Spain (377 girls and 378 boys;Mage= 11.49;SD= 0.67 at Time 1). Although participants, particularly boys, showed a decline in body shame in their transition to adolescence, early maturing girls (i.e., body hair, skin changes, breast growth, and menstruation) were especially vulnerable to experiencing body shame. Boys with a slower rate of pubertal change in body hair and facial hair (beard) growth were also vulnerable to experiencing body shame. Findings showed the different role that pubertal timing and tempo appeared to have among boys and girls in predicting body shame and, in line with the gendered deviation hypothesis, suggests important gender differences in experiencing atypical pubertal development for body image.
Should African countries be dependent on imported pandemic policies that are unworkable at the local level? This study delves into the under-researched contradictions in the adoption of foreign pandemic protocols and African peoples’ alternative reliance on Afro-indigenous approaches to pandemic control. The study interrogates imported pandemic control regimes such as free movement restrictions, lockdowns, crowdpolicing, and social distancing policies, and their applicability in Africa. From insights on the COVID-19 real-life experiences, this study challenges Western pandemic measures adopted by African governments for being locally insensitive to the African environment and for perpetuating vaccine inequity. The study rejects Afro-pessimist pandemic narratives and highlights the growing reliance on Afro-indigenous approaches to pandemic control, including the use of traditional/herbal medicines. A mix of global and local alternatives, or pandemic “glocalization,” with rich contents of Africa’s scientific and local knowledge-based contributions, is imperative for pandemic decoloniality and freedom.
Climate change evokes many kinds of feelings, including anxiety, inadequacy, guilt, shame, and despair. Scholars have found that hidden desires for reparation may be found in the midst of these eco-emotions. In pastoral care conversations with students, climate change adds extra pressure to the students’ underlying stress. The chaplains, who often represent “parental qualities” to the students, are challenged to navigate complex and powerful dynamics within pastoral conversations, where the sporadically expressed climate change stressors are entangled in other kinds of challenges in student life. These are experienced through a multiplicity of feelings, relations, values, cultures, views of life, and religious beliefs. Such complexities call for a pastoral care that encounters climate matters, requiring that chaplains be capable of moving between theology and psychology while differentiating between self and other, to process healthy and resilient meaning-making. Based on an ethnographic-theological study of chaplains’ pastoral care with students, this article argues that relief and strength may lie within an often implicit “theology of love” taken as the heart of the pastoral care practice. Using Sallie McFague’s theology on “God as Mother” and Melanie Klein’s psychology on the “love” and “reparation” of the “mother,” this article presents a practice-oriented model that may open up deeper understandings of the stress-relieving function of pastoral care in the era of climate change.
PurposeThe role of qualitative research in response-shift research has not been well characterized. This scoping review summarizes the status of qualitative studies on response shift.MethodsA scoping review of the medical literature was done using the keywords “response shift” and “qualitative” or “interview.” After excluding ineligible works, each retained article was rated by two independent raters according to the modified Critical Appraisal Skill Program (CASP) criteria. A synthesis of adjudicated review results further characterized the articles.ResultsThe search yielded 50 unique articles published from 1991 to 2023, 39 of which were retained after applying exclusion criteria. Most (69%) had the highest possible CASP score. Studies involved a broad range of patients by diagnosis or therapeutic context, caregivers, and healthcare professionals. While studies were often purely descriptive, many addressed components of response-shift theory or assumptions of response-shift methods. Study goals varied by design, time-focus (i.e., retrospective, present-focus or prospective), and by whether response-shift hypotheses were planned or post-hoc. The theoretical value added by the qualitative process involved examining the cognitive/emotional processes underlying quality-of-life ratings and response shifts. The methodological value added by the qualitative process facilitates understanding measurement error and non-responsiveness, and whether the methods used reflect the researchers’ presumptions.ConclusionThe use of qualitative methods in response-shift research yields a nuanced understanding of what response-shift “looks like” in different patient populations, thereby helping to translate results more directly to clinical experience. Studies contributed to response-shift theory or methods in ways not easily captured by purely quantitative research.
Despite its importance and prominence in public debates, including in many social science-related disciplines such as political science, anthropology, geography, and history, climate change has been unevenly addressed within critical sociology. In the tradition of critical theories, a critical sociology approach could contribute to climate science by discussing, for instance, what it means for societies and individuals to live together in times of ecological crisis and how this interplays with other crises and challenges of our time. As we face various transformations caused by climate change, sociology can inquire about social relations in the Anthropocene, including the critique of this concept and its alternatives, such as Capitalocene. This introductory article explores the intersection of sociology and the climate crisis, examining the sociological significance of the latter. It also discusses the importance for sociology, at both theoretical and empirical levels, to climate-related debates. It highlights the need for pluralistic approaches that can contribute to framing and addressing climate change, encompassing diagnosis, alternatives, science, and politics. The papers in this special issue seek to engage with and contribute to the abovementioned debate by covering theoretical and empirical perspectives on climate crisis, drawing attention to themes such as the relationship between critical theory and climate change, theories of modernity, the notion of (post)sustainability, just transitions, the role of media systems in fostering sustainable transformations, and the contribution of social movements to socioecological transformation, with a particular focus on the 'Global South'.
Some religious teachings include negative attitudes towards sexual/affectional minorities (S/AM), and those exposed to these teachings may experience internal conflict between their religious teachings and their own personal beliefs about S/AM. The goal of the current study was to understand how this conflict may interact with education/knowledge relating to S/AM and how this interaction may impact ally identity and activism behavioral intent. Findings from a survey of 1,166 adults from the United States indicate that knowledge about S/AM reduces religious conflict, which in turn reduces hatred towards S/AM. Additionally, more knowledge, reduced religious conflict, and reduced hate lead to increased ally identity and activism behavioral intent. These findings highlight the potential for religious leaders and congregations to reduce the stigma towards and improve the political landscape for S/AM.
Patients with acute psychosis are often confronted with the prejudice that they refuse all treatment due to lack of insight. This study examined and compared the aims and preferences for treatment of patients with acute psychosis and of psychiatric inpatient staff. A total of 142 inpatients being treated for a psychotic disorder on either a locked or an open ward indicated which of a range of symptoms they want to be treated and which of various biopsychosocial treatment options they would like to receive. Staff members from the same wards reported which psychiatric symptoms they deemed relevant in the treatment of psychosis and which treatment options should be offered. Patients assigned the highest treatment need to neurocognitive symptoms, followed by affective and positive symptoms. In contrast, staff assigned the highest treatment need to positive symptoms, followed by neurocognitive and affective symptoms. Patients and staff on open wards expressed more treatment needs overall than did patients and staff on locked wards. Patients’ desire for treatment differed across treatment types. In comparing patients on locked versus open wards, patients on open wards expressed higher approval of medication than patients on locked wards. Even patients with highly acute psychosis being treated on locked psychiatric wards endorsed treatment. Treatment preferences of this group deviated markedly in some instances from staffs’ preferences. Considering their specific needs may contribute to increasing patient self-efficacy, and improving adherence to treatment.
The association between higher education and political attitudes is well-recognized, and research suggests that socialization amongst peers is one of the most probable mechanisms explaining a possible attitudinal change. However, identifying a socialization effect is difficult due to self-selection mechanisms and limitations in data availability. This article empirically investigates the underlying peer socialization by employing a longitudinal network study of undergraduate students in Swedish and Finnish top-ranked business schools (N = 2651). The study tests the hypotheses that (1) attitudes within a cohort converge over time, and (2) socially embedded students experience more attitudinal change during their studies than students who do not engage with their peers. The paper leverages the Covid-19 pandemic as an exogenous shock that severely affected the networking dynamics of specific cohorts since it moved their education off campus. It is thereby among the first studies to directly test the relationship between socializing behaviors within higher education and political attitudes using both subjective and objective measurements. Contrary to previous conjectures, the findings challenge a general socialization mechanism to foster political attitudes. Instead, they point toward the importance of self-selection mechanisms in studies of higher education and for the specific student composition.
The limited existing literature studying the effects of childhood residential mobility suggests that it influences a range of life outcomes, at least in young adulthood. Little is known about how the frequency of moving in childhood is related to later-life demographic behaviour in Europe. Drawing on residential and partnership histories from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), this paper examines whether moving in childhood relates to union dissolution in adulthood. It empirically addresses two theoretical explanations underlying the potential association: First, according to the confounding hypothesis, effects of childhood residential mobility differ by family background and resources. Second, the family stress model suggests that the accumulated stress and conflicts associated with frequent residential mobility disrupt the family and child’s social ties, resulting in worse relationship skills in later life (mediation hypothesis). Applying discrete-time event history analysis to individuals born between 1945 and 1965 in Sweden, Denmark, and Finland, we find a significant association between childhood moves (prior to age 17) and adult union dissolution. The effect’s strength varies based on the number of childhood moves, demonstrating a clear gradient. Notably, adults with three or more childhood moves exhibit a 55% higher likelihood of union dissolution compared to non-movers. These associations persist even after accounting for childhood background factors, while family stress mediates the link partially. Our findings shed light on the role of spatial mobility in shaping demographic outcomes and underscore its potential contribution to the accumulation and reproduction of life disadvantages.
This paper aims to explore, and reframe, the relations between rock ‘n’ roll, leisure, ‘race’ and youth in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1950s, utilizing archival research to question the heritagization of the city’s popular music histories. Specifically drawing upon accounts of radio broadcasting and vinyl records, we offer an archival study of Cleveland, Ohio, a city that claims to be the “birthplace of rock ‘n’ roll” and (since 1986) is the site of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. After contextualizing the 1950s, we conceptualize the recent archival (re)turn in socio-cultural research. Through this methodological lens we overview the special collections, documents and artefacts explored in fieldwork at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s Library and Archives. Then, three counter-stories are presented toward decentring and demythologizing the canonical history of rock ‘n’ roll in Cleveland. Against this canonization, we “change the record” of histories of local radio broadcasting, record stores and eyewitness accounts from Cleveland’s black teenage audiences often absent from many authorized heritage discourses of early rock ‘n’ roll. In deconstructing myths of Cleveland’s musical past, the paper frames archival research as a critical, if under-utilized resource, in leisure research.
This paper considers the parliamentary career of Anthony Giddens, perhaps the most significant contemporary case of a sociologist achieving political office. Despite this, Giddens’ contributions to the House of Lords have been ignored by sociologists who are largely critical of his later political work. Drawing upon literature from the sociology of intellectuals, most notably positioning theory, I seek to understand Giddens’ unique positioning as an ‘intellectual in politics’ tied to a patron, in his case Tony Blair and New Labour. Following a discussion of how Giddens positioned himself to gain a peerage, I show how his spoken contributions to the Lords reflect three themes: (1) The ‘Intellectual in Politics’ positioning, (2) The role of drama and narrative in his performances, (3) The allure of a ‘Professional’ positioning and the turn towards political, rather than intellectual, interventions. I conclude by highlighting key lessons the sociology of intellectuals and sociology more generally can take from Giddens’ time in the Lords.
Many previous studies have shown that public service motivation (PSM) is associated with public sector employment. However, with few exceptions, such studies have focused on unelected positions in public sector bureaucracies, despite many other avenues for public service. Using a nationally representative survey of United States respondents, a survey of federal bureaucrats, and a survey of law students, we show that PSM is associated with ambition for holding elected office, high-level public sector positions, and judicial positions, at least in the United States. Moreover, the results are broadly comparable across different types of ambition (i.e., bureaucratic, electoral, and judicial), suggesting that the PSM dimensions—and especially Attraction to Policy Making (APM)—transcend institutions in explaining individuals’ interest in service in public sector offices of all types.
Legacies of an authoritarian past have enduring effects on voters’ attitudes and behaviors. I argue that authoritarian nostalgia is an important source of group sentiment and voter behavior in post-authoritarian democracies. Voters with nostalgic sentiment construct strong group sentiment based on historical perception and express attachment towards authoritarian successors. I test this argument with a new measure of authoritarian nostalgia. With original data collected from South Korea and Taiwan, I provide evidence that nostalgic voters are likely to exhibit strong group sentiment observable through partisan attachment. Abstracting from the specific cases, I use a randomly assigned candidate comparison analysis to demonstrate that voters high in authoritarian nostalgia are more attracted to hypothetical candidates invoking nostalgia than those with high programmatic or ideological proximity. Overall, the results show how authoritarian nostalgia remains important as a source of group sentiment in maturing democracies.
Parental involvement and teacher support have protective effects on adolescents’ externalizing behaviors. However, few studies investigated their interaction on externalizing behaviors among Chinese adolescents from divorced families. Guided by the stress-buffering theory, this cross-sectional study investigated the interactive effects between parental divorce, parental involvement, and teacher support on adolescents’ externalizing behaviors among Chinese adolescents. Participants were the nationally representative sample of 8218 Chinese students (Mage= 14.51 years,SD= 0.68 years; including 560 students from divorced families and 7658 students from intact families). Parental involvement, teacher support, and externalizing behaviors were primarily measured by related items in a student-reported questionnaire. Results indicated that: (1) adolescents from divorced families had lower levels of parental involvement and higher levels of externalizing behaviors compared with adolescents from intact families; (2) teacher support had stronger protective effect on externalizing behaviors among adolescents from divorced families compared with adolescents from intact families; (3) the interactive effect between parental involvement and teacher support on externalizing behaviors was significant among adolescents from divorced families, but not significant for adolescents from intact families. These findings support the stress-buffering model of social support, and have important practical implications for preventing externalizing behaviors among adolescents from divorced families.
Morten Levin’s work on Action Research (AR) clearly stated that the three pillars participation, action and research was equally important. During his long practice as an AR pioneer, he campaigned for the legitimacy of AR within academia. In this paper we investigate how AR is perceived as sound research within a large and distributed organization. We present a retrospective case study based on a research collaboration between UiT The Artic University of Norway (UiT) and the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Organization (NAV), that fostered an AR project together, ‘Work inclusion, learning and innovation’ (ALIN), but later led to the termination of the collaboration agreement. The ALIN project fulfils all the criteria for being a successful AR project in terms Levin’s action, research and participation criteria. However, external audit and central NAV actors had different expectations of successful institutional research collaboration. Through our case we illustrate several conflict dimensions within the three AR pillars that must be challenged to strengthen the legitimacy of AR. The debate on rigour and relevance should not be limited to academic fields and include various actors and decision makers within large and distributed organizations.
In Spain, unaccompanied migrant minors receive care provision from the government. This article analyzes the experience of unaccompanied young migrants in the protection system of Catalonia (Spain) and their preparation for the transition to independent living. A survey with 90 unaccompanied migrant youths who were about to leave care was conducted. The results show that many of the participants were in non-specific transitional housing placements (67.7%), with scarce opportunities for developing basic independent living skills. Moreover, 29.4% of young people were not aware of the existence of an emancipation plan, and 10.3% felt that they had not received any preparation for independent living. Although only 24.4% had completed secondary education or higher, the majority were enrolled in some form of training (82.2%). Nevertheless, most of the young people had had some paid unskilled work experience (83.3%) in their countries of origin. Despite this, when interviewed, only 10% of the participants were working, and their prospects for emancipation were challenging. Their main concerns were their legal status (40.2%), finding a job (41.4%), and finding a place to live once they reached legal age (34.2%). Moreover, the youths’ social support networks were very precarious: 43.5% could count on only one person or no one at all when they needed material support, and their main source of support was educators. Implications for social work practice are discussed.
In recent years, new data and methods have reinvigorated research on two central elements of elite political behavior: politicians’congruence withandknowledge ofcitizens’ opinions. Here, we survey over 700 elected officials in Canada to investigate and quantify the relationship between congruence (i.e. politicians’ alignment with constituents’ attitudes) and knowledge (i.e. politicians’ accurate perception of constituents’ attitudes) as pathways to substantive representation. We find that they are strongly related: congruent politicians also tend to have accurate perceptions of their constituents’ opinions. Individual and contextual correlates of success on each of the two pathways are very similar, but politicians’ performance varies considerably across policy issues. We discuss three main implications of our findings: congruence and perceptual accuracy as components of a single pathway to substantive representation; the need to better understand variation in congruence and perceptual accuracy across policy issues and policy-related factors; and the quality of substantive representation in contemporary democracies.
The trend towards evidence-based health care challenges chaplains to work with structured—predefined and standardized—interventions that lead to measurable outcomes. However, chaplaincy literature raises various objections against using a structured approach. These include compromising the chaplain-client relationship, standardizing and limiting chaplaincy content, and the instrumentalization of the spiritual dimension. Based on a thematic analysis of 20 interviews and 33 workbooks, the current study investigates the experiences of chaplains in the Netherlands who participated in a structured intervention provided in palliative clients’ homes. The results show that most chaplains did indeed struggle with developing a healing relationship with their clients in which they are attuned to their specific needs. At the same time, the participating chaplains reported that a structured approach enriches and broadens the content of their care, improves the impact on clients, and grasps the spiritual dimension of their work. We found that the chaplains’ experiences differed depending on the professional role they emphasized. When they integrate and balance the roles of companion, counselor, and spiritual guide evenly, a structured approach can complement chaplains’ professional identity.
Previous work has examined the relations between feminism, feminine gender roles, and body image concerns with inconclusive findings. The purpose of this study was to conduct an updated meta-analysis of the relation between feminist identity and negative embodiment, and to conduct new analyses to test how endorsement of femininity relates to negative embodiment. Through the technique of meta-analysis, we analyzed 80 studies (87 samples,N= 24,308) and 217 effect sizes to examine these associations. The predictor variables were measures of feminist identity and endorsement of femininity. The negative embodiment criterion variables were measures of body dissatisfaction, self-objectification, internalization of cultural body ideals, and disordered eating attitudes. Feminist identity was found to be negatively associated with negative embodiment, but only modestly, with small but significant effect sizes across most variables. Endorsement of femininity was found to be positively associated with negative embodiment, with mostly significant effect sizes ranging from small to large. These findings underscore the importance of considering the roles of feminist identity and traditional gender ideology in the etiology and prevention of women’s experiences of negative embodiment.
The cultural construal of leadership as masculine impedes women’s attainment of leader roles. This research examined whether adding feminine demands to a leader role relieved the greater stress experienced by women than men in a job interview for a leadership position and considered the processes that mediated women’s less favourable interview outcomes. In a hiring simulation, management students (N= 209; 112 women, 97 men) interviewed for a leader role framed by either stereotypically feminine or masculine role requirements. As shown by the stress biomarker salivary cortisol, the feminine role framing alleviated women’s, but not men’s, physiological stress response during the interview. However, under both masculine and feminine role framing, women, compared with men, reported lesser fit, expected poorer interview performance, appraised greater threat relative to challenge, and evaluated their performance less favourably, as did external raters. An additional vignette study (N= 305; 189 women, 111 men, 5 diverse) found that the feminine role framing increased the leader role’s communal demands but still conveyed strong agentic demands not different from those of the masculine role. In conclusion, although a feminine role framing alleviated women’s physiological stress response, it did not change their less favourable outcomes, as indicated by participants’ self-reports and others’ reports.
Most mothers recognize potential risks associated with social media and make decisions to promote their family’s safety. Mothers who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV) face unique challenges in maternal decision-making (MDM) about social media, as content can be weaponized by abusive partners to extend abuse and coercive control. While the risk of IPV persists beyond separation from an abusive partner, there is a dearth of literature exploring MDM about social media in post-separation contexts. Accordingly, this study aimed to explore how mothers make decisions about social media after separating from an abusive partner. This exploratory, descriptive case study originated from the broader ACTION project, which investigated IPV and MDM related to partner separation among a sample of Ontario-based mothers. This sub-study involved semi-structured interviews with five mothers. Thorne’s interpretive description was used, revealing three themes: uninhibited social media use, inhibited social media use, and maternal risk mitigation strategies. Most mothers described inhibited social media use post-separation to protect themselves and their children from perceived safety risks; violations of privacy were a commonly described risk. Mothers used various strategies, including active and restrictive mediation, to mitigate risks. This study provides novel, valuable insights into the complexities of MDM about social media after separation from an abusive partner and maternal lived experiences. Future research should aim to identify effective risk mitigation strategies for mothers using social media after separating from an abusive partner, as this knowledge could help social services to develop tailored online safety resources.
Recent research has shown that people who gamble are more likely to have suicidal thoughts and attempts compared to the general population. Despite the advancements made, no study to date has predicted suicide risk factors in people who gamble using machine learning algorithms. Therefore, current study aimed to identify the most critical predictors of suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts among people who gamble using a machine learning approach. An online survey conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 741 people who gamble (mean age: 25.9 ± 5.56). To predict the risk of suicide attempts and ideation, we employed a comprehensive set of 40 biological, psychological, social, and socio-demographic variables. The predictive models were developed using Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF), robust eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and ensemble machine learning algorithms. Data analysis was performed using R-Studio software. Random Forest emerged as the top-performing algorithm for predicting suicidal ideation, with an impressive AUC of 0.934, sensitivity of 0.7514, specificity of 0.9885, PPV of 0.9473, and NPV of 0.9347. Across all models, dissociation, depression, and anxiety symptoms consistently emerged as crucial predictors of suicidal ideation. However, for suicide attempt prediction, all models exhibited weaker performance. XGBoost showed the best performance in this regard, with an AUC of 0.663, sensitivity of 0.78, specificity of 0.8990, PPV of 0.34, NPV of 0.984, and accuracy of 0.8918. Depressive symptoms and rumination severity were highlighted as the most important predictors of suicide attempts according to this model. These findings have important implications for clinical practice and public health interventions. Machine learning could help detect individuals prone to suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among people who gamble, assisting in creating tailored prevention programs to address future suicide risks more effectively.
Protestors recently repurposed the abortion rights’ mantra, “my body, my choice,” to oppose COVID-19 mandates. But do those who oppose public health mandates fully support the right to choose? We answer this question by using exploratory analyses to identify the unique response patterns underlying support for abortion and COVID-19 mandates in random samples from the United States (Study 1;N= 2,331) and New Zealand (Study 2;N= 33,310). Latent profile analyses revealed a small subgroup in both countries (12.6% and 3.4% of the respective samples) who opposed mandates. Yet contrary to the “my body, my choice” rhetoric seen at anti-mandate protests, they also opposed abortion. Across both studies, those in theAnti-Mandateprofile tended to be more religious, conservative, and distrustful of institutions. In Study 2, they were also low on cognitive consistency and high on conspiracy belief. Finally, theAnti-Mandateprofile was opposed to free speech critical of both the United States and religion (Study 1), high on sexual prejudice (both studies), unsupportive of progressive protests (but supportive of reactionary protests; Study 2), and likely to vote for conservative parties (both studies). These results reveal the mobilization potential of the anti-mandate movement, uncover important contradictions within its members, and illustrate the nuanced ways in which opposition to gender policies (i.e., reproductive rights) coalesce with reactionary protests.
The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures changed many aspects of everyday life. Many anecdotal accounts of changes in people’s self-perceptions as they spent more time alone have been reported. To further explore these accounts, the current study investigated potential shifts between pre- and post-pandemic self-perceptions of gender, sexual, and romantic identities among university students and adults in Canada (N= 342;Mage = 22.8,SD= 6.7) during the Summer/Fall 2022. Participants were recruited for a study on changes in self-perceptions, body image, eating pathology, and sexual and gender identities, during the pandemic. Approximately half of participants indicated some change in their identity during the post-pandemic period. Specifically, participants reported changes in their identities related to sexual orientation and romantic attraction orientation, as well as sexual and romantic attraction rated continuously, gender identity, and gender expression. Changes in gender expression and changes in continuously-rated sexual and romantic attraction were more common than changes in identity labels (i.e., sexual and romantic orientation labels and gender identity). Participants also were asked to describe contributors to these changes in an open-text format. Response themes included time to reflect, reduced social interaction, and increased exploration through social media. These findings increase knowledge of the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on self-perceptions and how opportunities for introspection may allow individuals the space to re-conceptualize their gender, sexuality, and romantic identities.
Adolescence is a crucial period for gender socialization. While the theoretical link between parental involvement (i.e., the degree of parental engagement in parenting and child-rearing activities) and adolescents’ gender-typed traits (i.e., masculinity and femininity) is clear, the potential different influences of paternal and maternal involvement on boys and girls have yet to be explored. This study examined the moderating role of adolescents’ gender in the relations between parental involvement and adolescents’ gender-typed traits. A total of 512 Chinese adolescents (40.8% boys;Mage= 15.73 years,SD= 1.50) participated in this study and completed self-report measures of paternal involvement, maternal involvement, masculinity, and femininity. The results indicated that both higher maternal and paternal involvement were significantly associated with higher levels of adolescents’ masculinity in the total sample, but only higher maternal involvement was significantly associated with higher levels of femininity. However, multi-group comparison analysis showed that the association between paternal involvement and masculinity was only significant in boys. There were no significant differences between boys and girls in the association between maternal involvement and adolescent femininity or masculinity, nor in the association between paternal involvement and femininity. These findings challenge the narrow view that links the absence of certain gender-typed traits in adolescents solely to the lack of a certain parental figure. The findings highlight the significance of joint participation between fathers and mothers, emphasizing their crucial roles in fostering balanced development of gender-typed traits among adolescents.
Indigenous people experience health inequalities across the continuum of health services all over the world. A limited number of meta-analyses are available on indigenous wellbeing. This study contributes to the existing literature by exploring the relationship between indigenous wellbeing and health through meta-analysis. A random effect size of 27 independent samples is analyzed. From the 96 effect size, a significant positive relationship is observed between indigenous wellbeing and health (r = 0.07). Moderator analysis showed a significant effect of journal rank, the country's development status, and gender on the relationship between indigenous wellbeing and health. The meta-analysis indicates a significant relationship between indigenous wellbeing and health, migration, education, community, quality of life, and occupation. A definite conclusion on these outcomes is challenging to infer due to limited studies. Limitations include cross-sectional design and disparities in data collection techniques. Research suggests that a strengths-based approach can be a highly effective method for changing narratives of indigenous health. Moreover, it provides an alternative way to deal with health issues affecting indigenous people.
PurposeThis cross-sectional survey study quantified the humanistic burden of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), in terms of physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and work productivity, among adults with primary IgAN and their care-partners.MethodsHRQoL was assessed (01/31/22 − 05/31/23) with validated tools including the KDQoL-36 (with SF-12), GAD-7 (anxiety), PHQ-9 (depression), and WPAI: SHP (work productivity). Participant characteristics and total/domain scores were summarized; selected outcomes were compared to an external, kidney disease-free cohort.Results117 adults with IgAN and their care-partner pairs, and one adult without a care-partner, were included. The mean ages of patients and care-partners were 38.0 (SD: 8.6) and 40.2 (11.8) years, respectively; 55.9% and 43.6% were female. Mean physical and mental SF-12 scores for patients were 46.7 (SD: 8.0) and 41.9 (9.2), respectively, and 50.7 (7.3) and 43.7 (10.24) for care-partners. Both SF-12 components for patients, and the mental component for care-givers, were significantly worse compared to the US general population. Among patients, 27.1% had moderate/severe anxiety and 49.2% reported at least moderate depression. Compared to external controls, patients experienced significantly higher severity of anxiety (6.6 vs. 5.4) and depression (8.1 vs. 6.6; bothp< 0.0001). Among care-partners, 13.7% experienced moderate anxiety and 37.8% experienced moderate/moderately-severe depression. Among employed individuals, both groups reported IgAN-related absenteeism (8.8–9.4%), presenteeism (25.1–25.9%), and overall work impairment (30.4–30.5%).ConclusionUS adults with IgAN and their care partners experience impairments to mental and physical HRQoL and heightened levels of depression and anxiety, underscoring the need for effective IgAN therapies and care-partner support.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lifelong illness that impacts the lungs and digestive system and often results in early death. Anxiety and depression are common amongst individuals with CF and their parents/guardians. While parent/guardian mental health has been shown to be impacted by their child’s CF diagnosis; most mental health supports and recommendations focus solely on people with the diagnosis and not their parents/guardians. The current study investigated the quality of online mental health information for parents/guardians of children with CF. Nineteen CF parent/guardians support-themed websites were coded using standardized criteria. Websites were evaluated for accountability, presentation, alignment with evidence-based practice, readability, and recommendations to seek professional support. Results indicated that very few sites focused on the mental health of parents/guardians of children with CF and the quality of information was generally poor. Most websites met less than half of the standardized criteria and were poorly aligned with evidence-based practice. Increased quantity and quality of mental health information available in accessible forms for this group is needed.
PurposeThe EQ-5D has been used to assess health related quality of life (HRQoL) in respiratory conditions. However, the core descriptive system may not be sensitive to all the HRQoL impacts of these conditions. To increase the sensitivity of the descriptive system, two respiratory specific bolt-ons, have been developed. Psychometric assessment of the bolt-ons in comparison to other validated instruments is required to facilitate their use. Therefore, the aim of this study is to test the psychometric characteristics of the EQ-5D-5L + R using a large dataset collected in Australia.MethodsA cross-sectional online survey was used to recruit adult respondents (≥ 18 years) representative of the Australian population. Descriptive and psychometric analyses were used to understand the performance of the EQ-5D-5L and bolt-ons in comparison to other validated instruments. The construct validity was estimated using correlations. Known-group validity was tested to determine the sensitivity of the instruments to differences across different severity groups.ResultsOverall 10,033 respondents (52% female) completed the survey, of which 300 had a respiratory condition. There were moderate to high correlation between bolt-ons with EQ-5D-5L and WHODAS. The EQ-5D-5L + bolt-ons slightly reduced the ceiling effect in comparison to the EQ-5D-5L. The effect size was larger for people with respiratory conditions than people who did not have a respiratory condition.ConclusionThe results show that adding the respiratory bolt-on to the EQ-5D-5L might slightly improve the instruments descriptive sensitivity. The choice of bolt-on may be driven by whether overall problems or limitations are being measured.
Research examining cognitive models of parenting risk has linked poorer parental executive functioning capacities to increased risk for poor parenting outcomes including use of harsh discipline and problematic patterns of parent-child interaction. To better inform intervention and prevention efforts targeting parenting risk, there is a need to further articulate this association by identifying intermediaries between parents’ executive functioning capacities and parenting behavior. Social-cognitive models of parenting risk suggest that one such intervening factor is parents’ ability to form accurate appraisals during social situations, including accurate appraisals of others’ affect. We tested this assertion by examining the extent to which mothers’ accuracy for recognizing affect, presented in both auditory and visual modalities, explained associations between mothers’ executive functioning capacities and two indicators of parenting risk: maladaptive discipline responses and dyssynchronous patterns of parent-child interaction. Associations were tested among 95 mother-preschooler (48.4% female; average age 4.94 years) dyads, 31 of whom had histories of maternal perpetration of child neglect. Mothers exhibited high levels of social (92.6% non-White; average of 11.51 years of education; 65.3% single parents) and economic disadvantage (median family income of $19,000). Consistent with prior research, we found associations between lower maternal executive functioning capacities and higher levels of parenting risk. Using Hayes’ PROCESS Macro, we found that mothers’ affective misappraisals partially explained these associations although findings differed by sensory modality. Our findings suggest that poorer maternal executive functioning capacities contribute to inaccurate affect identification, which in turn may lead to maladaptive patterns of parent-child interaction and inappropriate discipline responses.
PurposeFor patients with celiac disease (CeD), the only current management option is adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD); however, many patients on a GFD continue to experience symptoms with a significant impact on quality of life. Potential new treatments for CeD are under development and a validated patient-reported outcome measure is required to evaluate their utility in clinical trials. The purpose of this article is to provide a history of the development of the Celiac Disease Symptom Diary (CDSD) 2.1©for use in clinical trials.MethodsQualitative and quantitative studies were conducted from 2010 to 2021, including concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing interviews with adult and adolescent participants with CeD (N= 93) diagnosed via biopsy and/or serology and input from eight interviews with CeD clinical experts. During these studies, different iterations of the CDSD were presented to the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, and modifications were made in line with their feedback.ResultsThese studies ultimately led to the development of CDSD 2.1©, a daily diary which focuses on key symptoms of CeD (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, nausea and tiredness). This patient-reported outcome measure was readily understood by adult and adolescent participants with CeD and content validity was demonstrated in both populations.ConclusionCDSD 2.1©is a content-valid patient-reported outcome measure developed in accordance with best practices and regulatory guidance. A thorough exploration of the psychometric properties of CDSD 2.1©for both adult and adolescent participants with CeD is ongoing to support utilization in clinical trials.
Financial well-being and overall health are significantly linked, especially among those in poverty who have been exposed to violence and suffer from unaddressed trauma. Yet existing public assistance programs fail to address the presence or impact of trauma and adversity. Built specifically for families living in poverty who experience adversity, the Building Wealth and Health Network (the Network) provides a space for families to heal from the effects of trauma while also building social networks and economic security. The sample for this study was primarily Black (91%) women (92%) in Philadelphia with at least one child. A repeated measures linear regression model was performed via a Difference-in-Differences approach to test differences in financial well-being scores between two groups (full participation vs. low/no participation) at two time points (baseline vs 3 months, and baseline vs 6 months). We use this program as a field study to better understand the financial well-being of program participants who took part in fewer or more program sessions. Those who participated in more sessions reported greater increases in two measures of financial well-being at three months and six months post baseline, when compared to those with low or no participation.
Men are reported to prioritise physical attractiveness in potential intimate partners, while women focus on the abilities of potential partners to provide resources. Yet previous research has suggested that these traditional gender differences vary according to national levels of gender equality. Here, we used priming material to manipulate participants’ perceptions of gender equality and examined the effects on self-reported partner preferences, and we also investigated the association between participants’ gender role attitudes and partner preferences. In Study 1 and 2 (n= 224 and 380), participants were presented with priming material that focused on either inequality between the genders in the present day (Inequality Condition) or recent improvements in gender equality (Equality Condition). Contrary to our predictions, the importance that participants placed on the physical traits and resource-gaining potential of partners did not differ between conditions in either study. However, on average, men placed greater emphasis on physical traits and preferred younger partners, and women placed greater emphasis on resource-gaining characteristics and preferred older partners, in line with previous research. In addition, men who reported more positive feminist attitudes placed less emphasis on physical traits, and women who reported more positive feminist attitudes placed greater emphasis on kindness, compared to same-gender participants who scored lower on feminist attitudes. This research suggests that self-reported partner preferences are related to an individual’s feminist attitudes and highlight the challenges of exploring these associations with forced-choice and experimental priming designs.
The goal of the current study is to glean lessons learned from the Fostering Higher Education (FHE) intervention evaluation study to provide concrete strategies for helping other youth-serving organizations overcome barriers to participating in manualized intervention implementation and evaluation. Specifically, this study assesses lessons learned in organizations that serve youth with foster care experience regarding (1) implementing FHE in relation to (a) site preparation, (b) implementation, and (c) pursuing racial equity in practice; and (2) participating in research/evaluation. This study involves qualitative analyses of surveys, emails, and meeting notes from FHE implementation staff, supervisors, administrative staff, and TA providers across three study sites in the United States. Surveys assessed lessons learned by site implementation staff during the FHE implementation and evaluation process, as well as quarterly assessments of the technical assistance for implementation and evaluation provided to FHE implementation sites by the research team. Emails and meeting notes provided insights into sites’ implementation- and research/evaluation-related experiences and challenges as they were happening during the study. Communication/collaboration were key for the success of both implementation and evaluation of FHE, while training and technology were also key for implementation, and project timing and understanding the value of research were important for evaluation participation. Key themes regarding the pursuit of racial equity in FHE practice included the importance of collective learning, independent practice, and client-centered program delivery. A variety of recommendations for other youth-serving organizations interested in implementing and evaluating manualized interventions are provided based on the study’s findings.
ObjectivesThe goal of this research is to investigate the association between online and offline gang conflict. It does this by investigating the magnitude and causal ordering of this association with a case study of Chicago Latino gangs.MethodsChicago Police Department records of gang shootings (N = 566) are combined with 9873 gang confrontations on social media from a Facebook page devoted to Chicago Latino gangs. A bivariate Hawkes point process is then fit to the data to estimate spillover effects from Facebook to Chicago street violence and vice versa.ResultsWe estimate that each shooting causes 0.068 (0.015, 0.182) negative Facebook comments directed towards the victim gang. We estimate that each negative Facebook comment directly causes 0.002 excess shootings, though this effect is not statistically significant. When focusing on the three most active gangs, the measured spillover effects are even larger. We estimate for the three most active gangs, 9% of Facebook comments are caused by shootings and 3% of shootings are caused by negative Facebook comments, however the latter effect is not statistically significant.ConclusionsThe data indicates that most online negative interactions between gangs stay online. Further we find that the only causal relationship the data supports is that offline violence leads to negative interactions online. We did not find statistically significant evidence of a causal relationship in which online interactions lead to offline violence. Finally, the data suggests contextual considerations, such as the size of the gang, need to be considered when assessing such relationships.
This paper examines how Italian visual artists are now structurally encouraged to be proficient in performing activities unrelated to field-specific criteria, or – to use the words of one respondent – why they are supposed to “be good at being incredibly good at doing stuff they don’t know how to do.” Drawing on qualitative data (N= 135), four dimensions of unartistic yet binding concerns are explored: networking relationality, bureaucratic “callification,” systemic politics, and outward visibility. To analyze this dynamic, the concept of “Matryoshka roles” is introduced. Although uncharacteristic of artists’ work and nested inside its surface depiction (Matryoshka), each dimension entails a set of injunctions and sanctioned behavior (roles) that reconfigure the reality of contemporary visual artists and vitiate the separation between internal vs. external principles of hierarchization. Reflecting on the autonomy of the field of visual art as a transitory historical phase, mechanisms of fields’ heteronomization are addressed. By considering a series of factors (e.g., differences among early- and late-career artists, presence on social media, perception of heteronomous practices, most distinctive accomplishments, career junctions), the increasing pressure of meta-fields of economics, power, and state is detailed.
Biodiversity loss, habitat degradation, globalization, and societal transformations are challenging rural, and especially coastal communities in Guinea-Bissau where mangrove-dependent livelihoods are exposed to increased vulnerability. The Diola, traditional farmer-fishermen of the northern island-villages, have witnessed swift societal changes following the country’s economic liberalization, climate change, and youth migration from rural areas. Despite historically being a secondary subsistence activity with more predefined gender roles rooted in tradition, mangrove fishing has become a major source of cash income. Yet, women’s mangrove fishing contributions are still overlooked, resulting in general assumptions of static female fishing identities with limited control over their income. We present three case studies of Diola women’s involvement in mangrove fishing through a mixed method approach that combines qualitative techniques and household surveys conducted between 2017 and 2023. Specifically, we explore: (1) diverging societal coping strategies and livelihood developments in three Diola villages; (2) the primary drivers behind village-specific societal transformations; (3) social dynamics and female roles in mangrove fishing-related activities and village decision-making; and (4) the political ecology of interventions. Our findings underscore the complexity of gender-fluid small-scale fishing strategies as female roles beyond fish trade defy cultural generalizations. Contemporary Diola women make autonomous personal and work choices that meet their current needs and add to their household budget to face new welfare demands. Inclusive resource governance needs more gender-specific data for meaningfully implemented interventions adapted to local circumstances, enabling an active participation of all genders in conservation practices and development.
This study investigates the relationship between ‘household headship and filial expectations’ and ‘risk of mortality’ for widowed women aged 45 years and above in India. The study used the India Human Development Survey (IHDS), a nationally representative longitudinal survey. The results indicate no excess mortality risk for widows compared to married women, where widows or their sons were household heads. On the other hand, when the widows were in households headed by others (viz.brothers, sons-in-law, grandsons, and extended family members), widows had a heightened mortality risk compared to married women. Further, the analysis suggests that despite heading households if widows expected financial support from their sons, they had higher mortality than widows who did not expect financial support from their sons. The main results hold in multiple robustness checks. First, even after adjusting for the endogeneity between household headship and economic status using the instrument variable (IV) regression model, the results indicate that older widows in households headed by themselves had almost a 30% increased mortality risk compared to the rest of the widows. Second, the heterogeneity analysis suggests that household headship was linked with increased odds of mortality in widows if they were heading the household and did have financial expectations from their sons, particularly if they belonged to poor households and living in rural India. Given that the share of widows in the total older population is expected to rise considerably in the future, the findings assume importance for both policy and practice.
On February 6, 2023, two major earthquakes with magnitudes of 7,7 and 7,6 struck the Kahramanmaraş region in Turkey. Over 50.000 people lost their lives and more than half a million buildings were damaged as a result of these earthquakes. Earthquake survivors may develop post-traumatic stress disorder and sleep hygiene problems. This study aims to evaluate the correlation between post-traumatic stress and sleep hygiene among surviving adults six months after the February 6th Kahramanmaraş Earthquakes in Turkey. This study was conducted with 1004 earthquake survivors in 11 provinces influenced by the February 6th Kahramanmaraş earthquakes in Turkey. The data was collected with Personal Information Form, Impact of Events Scale-Revised, and the Sleep Hygiene Index. It has been determined that 54.1% of earthquake survivors scored ≥ 33 on the Impact of Events Scale-Revised. The level of post-traumatic stress disorder was high and their sleep hygiene index level was above average among earthquake survivors. A strongly significant positive correlation was observed between the Impact of Events Scale-Revised and the Sleep Hygiene Index. It is recommended to plan and implement community-based psychological interventions to reduce post-traumatic stress disorder and improve sleep hygiene among survivors after earthquakes.
This essay argues that the ancient practice of “the care of souls” needs to be re-imagined amid a climate crisis that is taking an increasing toll on people’s emotional, psychological, and spiritual health. Drawing on recent work on climate emotions while acknowledging critiques of the seemingly privileged nature of eco-anxiety discourse, the author suggests three dimensions of a re-imagined soul care while suggesting spiritual resources and practices from Christian history that may help people navigate difficult climate-related emotions in ways that move them beyond hopeless despair and debilitated inaction.
Maintaining the parent–child relationship while a parent is incarcerated is critical to the well-being of both parent and child. There is some evidence that video visits can be beneficial when they are used to supplement rather than replace in-person visits. This study explores how video visits support the father–child relationship during parental incarceration. Research was conducted with two public prisons in New South Wales, Australia, during the period of COVID-19 restrictions. Interviews with children’s carers (n= 17) and fathers (n= 27) were analysed to identify the ways fathers engaged with their children and the benefits of the relationship. Three themes were identified:show and tell, which explored how the visual element of video visits contributed to parent–child interactions;part of their world, which identified how video visits became integrated into children’s everyday lives; andalong for the ride, which focused on child-initiated interactions. Challenges of using video visits were also explored in two themes:difficulty engaging, which showed how fathers and children can struggle to communicate and interact, andtiming and transitions, which highlighted how video visits could be difficult or disruptive to children’s mood and routines. Overall, video visits were perceived as enabling interactions that strengthened the engagement and relationship between the father and child.
Consideration of weather and the environment is becoming increasingly prominent in the field of historical demography. Early studies on infant mortality have paved the way for this type of analysis, shedding light on the significant impact of cold weather conditions on child survival. However, recent research on contemporary populations has drawn attention to the increased risk of adverse birth outcomes due to maternal exposure to heat during pregnancy. The present study aims to validate this finding in a pre-transitional population, specifically focusing on its effects on neonatal mortality. To our knowledge, this analysis is being applied to such populations for the first time, with the goal of exploring whether factors other than cold winters may have also influenced mortality mechanisms during this crucial life stage in historical populations. The results show that heat exposure significantly affected early neonatal mortality, and they also reveal that the susceptibility window was limited to the second trimester of gestation. Temperature-related risks of death were influenced by the tie the family had to the land, with sharecroppers being at the lowest risk. This finding was attributed more to cultural elements associated with the value of children within this social group than to purely economic factors related to living conditions.
It is widely acknowledged that parents’ beliefs about their competence to parent (i.e., parental self-efficacy; PSE) influence an array of important outcomes, such as parenting behaviours, and parents’ and children’s psychological functioning. PSE is essential in parental navigation of day-to-day activities, and has thus been studied across multiple domains. One domain which, surprisingly, has received little attention is how competent parents feel to manage their children’s emotions (i.e., emotion socialization-related PSE). To supplement the extant utilization of quantitative methodology, and to investigate PSE in the context of emotion socialization, we qualitatively investigated parents’ beliefs about their competence to teach and handle their children’s emotions. Given that men and women often occupy distinct roles informed by gender differentiated sociocultural norms, we also uniquely examined and compared mothers’ and fathers’ perspectives on emotion socialization-related PSE. Mothers (n= 40) and fathers (n= 42) of children between the ages of 8 to 12 discussed PSE in focus groups. Content analysis explicated the nature of emotion socialization-related PSE as well as six factors that bolster and diminish PSE. Similar categories emerged for mothers and fathers, with some notable gender differences in the extent to which certain facilitators (i.e., emotion skills, resources, social support and the parent-child relationship) and barriers (i.e., inadequate resources) were described as influential in PSE. Findings are discussed in light of their possible clinical utility in tailoring parenting interventions and future research directions.
The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of introductory meetings conducted in preschools on children’s school adjustment and teacher burnout. The study included 110 children in the treatment group and 109 children in the control group. A total of 24 participating teachers, with thirteen in the treatment group and eleven in the control group, were involved in the research. Teachers in the treatment group planned and implemented a one-on-one meeting day with children and parents, lasting approximately half an hour. Six weeks after the schools opened, teachers evaluated the children’s school adjustment levels using the School Adjustment Teacher Rating Scale and assessed teacher burnout using the Teacher Burnout Scale. Additionally, they responded to open-ended survey questions probing the impact of the school adjustment process on children, parents, and teachers. The results indicated that teachers conducting introductory meetings received significantly higher scores in all sub-dimensions of the School Adjustment Scale, including school avoidance, school liking, cooperative participation, and self-directiveness, compared to teachers who did not conduct introductory meetings. There was no significant difference in teacher burnout data between the groups. Open-ended responses data further emphasized that teachers who implemented the practice perceived it as effective in facilitating the school adjustment process.
Leisure activities play a crucial role in promoting physical and mental health, enhancing family cohesion, fostering personal development, and facilitating social interactions, ultimately improving overall quality of life. Education, as a significant determinant of leisure activities, influences individual leisure time through the development of human capital, time management skills, and gender role perceptions. Using data from the first China Time Use Survey (CTUS) of residents of China, this paper systematically investigates the differences in leisure time allocation among working groups aged 25–54 that have different education levels and empirically analyzes the differences in residents’ leisure time and their influence mechanisms using the Tobit model.The study first finds that residents’ leisure patterns are relatively homogeneous, and leisure is dominated by activities that require media. Moreover, education can significantly influence the type of leisure activities in which the population participates, with the higher education group engaging more in active leisure activities, such as using the Internet and reading books. Second, education has a significant positive effect on leisure time: the higher an individual’s level of education, the longer the leisure time. Differences in residents’ leisure time due to education level mainly comes from activities that require media. Third, where education level is the same, residents’ gender difference more significantly impact leisure time, with men having significantly more leisure time than women, and gender differences associated with leisure time become greater as an individual’s education level increases. Based on the above conclusions, this paper proposes policy recommendations from three perspectives: optimizing the diversity of leisure activities for residents, reducing the gender gap in leisure time, and balancing the allocation of leisure resources between urban and rural residents. The recommendations include increasing the number of public cultural facilities such as libraries and museums, implementing parental leave policies, and organizing traditional festivals and folk activities.
Fire is an essential tool enabling tropical subsistence agriculture, but can result in escaped fires when not adequately controlled. We employed agricultural calendars, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews with over 60 farmers over four months of fieldwork to evaluate how agricultural burning is currently conducted in the Peruvian Andes. We found that Quechua farmers use fire for clearing agricultural residue, controlling weeds and shrubs, and preparing new or fallow parcels, with most burns set during the dry season. Quechua farmers employ control burning techniques that reflect an understanding of how fire behavior is influenced by fuel, topography, and weather conditions, a knowledge that aligns closely with Western use of prescribed and controlled burns. We also observed a high incidence of escaped fires, although most were controlled within an hour, and very few required community-wide intervention to extinguish. Our findings have significant policy implications for the safe and effective use of fire in rural agricultural landscapes. Rather than solely impose fire suppression, governments could facilitate access to modern wildfire risk indices and provide technical assistance for controlled burns, compatible with farmers’ existing knowledge of factors influencing fire behavior. These recommendations are part of a worldwide call for collaborative fire management solutions that are reasonable and applicable in diverse settings in the Global South.
This paper investigates the synergy between Levin’s theories on technology transfer as a socio-technical learning and developmental process (TLD process), and what we learnt about socio-technical systems (STS) theories in a case study developing human robot solutions for the construction sector. Levin’s extensive work highlights the significance of technology transfer as a means for organizational development. His TLD process emphasizes the intricate interplay between technology, organizational change, and learning and highlights the importance of incorporating cultural knowledge and skills into the technological transfer process. Contemporary STS views developed through our own work are introduced to complement and extend Levin’s theories by providing a systemic lens to understand the broader socio-technical context in which technology transfer occurs. To illustrate the synergies and potential challenges from Levin’s theories of technology transfer with contemporary STS concepts, we use a qualitative study of a unique case about the design and development of human-robot teams (HRTs) for construction tasks. Our findings reveal that while Levin’s theories provide a valuable foundation for understanding technology transfer and organizational change, contemporary socio-technical systems face unique challenges in the context of AI-driven human-robot teams, where intelligent robots also contribute to the socio-technical learning process. Moreover, the rapidly evolving nature of technology and innovations could exponentially impact on multidisciplinary design teams, stakeholder participation and inter-organizational dynamics. The discussions suggest an extension of co-generative learning to incorporate ‘collaborative intelligence’ between human-robot teams enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, we suggest that Levin’s theories of technology transfer, developed before the rapid application of AI, may not have fully considered further social challenges caused by the introduction of autonomous systems such as AI-driven HRT systems. We extend Levin’s important work by suggesting that addressing such challenges requires ongoing dialogue and collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with different disciplinary backgrounds to develop robust and reliable socio-technical systems frameworks to navigate the complexities of robotics and AI in today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape.
Cultivating positive psychological qualities in college students is one of the goals of mental health education for college students in China, and how to integrate mental health education with subject teaching is a new issue in higher education. This study takes XX University’s social work internship course as an example, and explores effective ways to organically combine students’ professional identity, professional competence, and psychological quality enhancement through the use of service learning project. Employing a meticulously crafted quasi-experimental design, this study conducts a comprehensive comparison between two distinct internship modes: service learning and agency internships. The primary objective centers on assessing their differential impact on college students’ positive psychological qualities. The unequivocal findings unveil that engagement in service learning engenders a remarkable enhancement in the positive psychological qualities of college students upon completion of the internship period. Conversely, no discernible disparity is observed in the positive psychological qualities of college students who partook in agency internships before and after the internship. This striking discrepancy accentuates the vastly superior efficacy of service learning in augmenting the positive psychological qualities of college students when juxtaposed with agency internships. These consequential findings underscore the profound significance of various elements, encompassing the service scene, the beneficiaries of service, grassroots workers, and the students’ subjective experiences, in fostering positive psychological qualities among college students. Additionally, they illuminate the pivotal role played by educators in providing guidance and encouragement, as well as the influential impact of peers and emotional support. Collectively, these factors culminate in the resounding success of the service learning model, facilitating transformative psychological growth and development among college students.
As images of international mobility circulate quickly and widely through digital and social media, they form a fundamental part of the discursive formations around border policies and material migration practices. Through a multi-modal visual analysis of the Twitter images accompanying the post of the four major migration institutions in the EU and Canada, this article explores in a comparative perspective how their visual narratives interact with the broader migration narrative across the two contexts. The study findings show that EUAA, FRONTEX, CBSA, and IRCC participate in the border spectacle as leading actors, and their visual communication while allows them to reinforce some of their respective migration governance key messages and display their multiple organizational identities at the same time enables the concealment of some of the critical themes of the EU and Canada migration governance.
This study aimed to estimate the percentage of child RTCs utilizing seclusion and restraint (S/R) practices and examine predictors associated with increased likelihood of S/R use between 2010 and 2020. A secondary analysis of the National Mental Health Services Survey was conducted (n-range = 580–781). Facility-level client demographics and facility characteristics were examined using multi-level logistic regression. One-way ANOVA indicated that the percentage of child RTCs using S/R significantly decreased between 2010 and 2020 [F(4, 58074) = 75.62,p<.001]. Apost-hocBonferroni test found that the percentage of facilities reporting the use of SR in 2010 was significantly higher than in 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020 (allp<.001). Multi-level logistic regression analysis found that facility-level client demographics (percent male, white, and involuntarily committed) did not significantly predict facility use of SR in 2010, 2014, or 2016. However, facility-level characteristics of SED program (allp<.01), use of psychotropic medication (allp<.001), and facility size as measured by number of mental health beds (allp<.01) consistently predicted usage of SR in 2010 [F(11) = 68.38,p<.001], 2014 [F(12) = 74.25,p<.001], and 2016 [F(12) = 74.48,p<.001]. Facility ownership and accepting Medicare payments did not significantly predict facility usage of SR. Use of SR within child RTCs significantly declined between 2010 and 2020. Larger facilities, facilities with an SED program, and facilities that used psychotropic medications with clients were more likely to use SR practices between 2010 and 2016. More high-quality, publicly available data for monitoring S/R use in mental health services within the United States is needed.
We recorded local knowledge of wild food plants (WFPs) among the Palula minority in the Chitral region of northwest Pakistan through semi-structured interviews with 25 elderly participants. Data were compared with the previously published food ethnobotanical studies conducted in NW Pakistan. A total of 45 plant taxa were recorded, mainly used as cooked vegetables and raw snacks. A cross-cultural comparison of the foraging practices among the different ethnolinguistic groups revealed that the Palula shared more than two-thirds of the recorded WFPs with the other groups. This homogeneity may suggest that ecocultural homogenization occurred after the group migrated into the study area many decades ago and adapted to the more common and dominant socioecological patterns characterizing the Chitral area of the Hindukush region. We found that the original WFP nomenclature and reports among the Palula were likely affected by Kho and Pashto cultures, whose languages are widely spoken aslingua francasin Chitral. Thus, Palula foraging heritage might have been blended and osmotically mixed with that of the majority groups. The current study underscores the urgent need for policymakers to pay more attention to protecting ecocultural diversity and promoting the resilience of minority groups.
The concept of happiness is becoming an increasingly significant area of focus in the evaluation of overall quality of life. This research examines the impact of migration on the well-being of women who remain in their place of residence following the migration of their family members. The study employs data from the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (2017–2018) in Punjab, Pakistan, and addresses sample selection bias through Propensity Score Matching (PSM). Moreover, as the dependent variable is ordinal, the study employed ordered logistic regression to examine the correlation between migration and happiness, taking into account migration status and other variables. The findings indicate that women from migrant backgrounds tend to benefit from migrating, primarily in terms of enhanced financial resources. In order to gain insight into the varying effects of migration on women’s happiness, the study employed heterogeneity analysis, which revealed that the influence of migration on women’s happiness differs across various areas. In conclusion, the combination of propensity score matching (PSM) with ordered logistic regression and heterogeneity analysis represents a robust methodology for evaluating the impact of migration on women’s perceptions of happiness. The study demonstrates that migration has the potential to improve the quality of life of women who remain in their home countries, particularly those residing in financially disadvantaged households.
The contribution of Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) to natural resource management has recently gained increasing prominence in academia, policymaking, and civil society. However, persistent knowledge gaps concerning the contribution of ILK to sustainable landscape management remain. We investigate existing local knowledge and practices of the Tonga of Kalomo District, Zambia, and their contribution to sustainable landscape management by combining walking interviews with photovoice. Especially Tonga women and youth are important knowledge holders for land management, agricultural practices, and tree conservation. We found that local knowledge is often ‘hybridised’ with ‘external knowledge’ when local knowledge alone is deemed insufficient. In some cases, introduced ‘external knowledges’ are simply reconstituted long-standing local practices. Nevertheless, local communities often perceive external knowledge holders as “knowing better.” Finally, we show how local knowledge and associated practices have been simultaneously eroded and lost and describe those that have remained resilient to provide insights into the complexity of hybridisation processes where different knowledge systems interact.
The accelerating convergence of digitization and sustainability has given rise to the digital sustainability concept, emphasizing responsible and sustainable use of digital technologies to pursue a systemic sustainable development involving the triple dimension of economy, society, and environment. Despite the growing interest in digital sustainability, existing analyses remain fragmented and lack a holistic perspective on the multifaceted outcomes of digital transformation. This study aims to address this research gap by comprehensively investigating the impact of digital technologies on the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of digital development in European countries. By adopting a quantitative aggregative approach, this study constructs an index, the Digital Development Index (DDI), to measure and compare the three dimensions of digital sustainable development across the European countries (EU27). The index was based on 227 indicators from the Eurostat database. The results show advanced digital development in Western and Northern Europe, while disparities persist in Southern, Central, and Eastern European countries. In addition, correlation analysis shows that higher GDP per capita enables more effective digital development across the three dimensions, facilitating technology adoption, innovation, digital education, and fortifying digital foundations. Our study contributes to the literature by providing a new index to understand the factors influencing digital sustainability in the European context, highlighting established trends and dynamics. Furthermore, the paper offers multiple implications for managers and policymakers to identify the most appropriate policies and strategies for the joint development of the three spheres of sustainable development.
Educational pathways present a new avenue for refugee resettlement, offering opportunities for academic advancement and integration. This paper departs from the academic papers in this special issue to offer the perspective of Emanuel, a refugee from Eritrea, and his personal experience navigating the University Corridors for Refugees (UNICORE) project in Italy. UNICORE, facilitated by collaborative effects between Italian universities and refugee support organisations, provides select African students the chance to pursue a Master’s degree in Emanuel’s initial excitement after being accepted into the scheme was tempered by isolation after his studies coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic though he found support through university staff and the volunteer network of Caritas. However, challenges emerged regarding his refugee status and documentation, leading to a protracted process of seeking international protection, adversely impacting Emanuel’s mental health and academic focus. Despite his own resilience, Emanuel struggled with the limited opportunities after graduation, due to his unresolved legal status. In this piece, Emanuel’s experience underscores the transformative potential of educational pathways for refugee students, whilst highlighting the systematic gaps in long-term integration and employment prospects for refugee students. More collaborative efforts between universities, refugee support organisations and immigration departments are essential to address these barriers effectively and provide students with the opportunity to build successful lives in Italy.
Fatigue is one of the most common health complaints, yet assessing it can be difficult when perceptions of others’ fatigue are distorted by gender bias. This research is the first to examine whether such a bias is present in the perception of men’s and women’s fatigue. Across two studies (totalN= 201), perceivers viewed silent videoclips of men and women targets in a social interaction and were asked to estimate each targets’ fatigue. While women reported more fatigue than men, across both studies perceivers rated women as significantly less fatigued than men. Results from Study 2 further suggested that women’s fatigue was significantly underestimated in comparison to their own self-reports of fatigue while men’s fatigue was significantly overestimated in comparison to their own self-reports. To explore whether any differences in ratings of targets’ fatigue were due to targets’ own behavior, we also coded each target for various nonverbal cues that could be associated with fatigue. An examination of these nonverbal cues did not reveal any significant relationships with self-reported fatigue for either men or women targets. However, the more nonverbally expressive/attentive targets were, the less likely they were to be judged as fatigued by perceivers and women targets displayed more expressiveness/attentiveness than men targets, explaining some of the variance in why women’s fatigue was underestimated more than men’s. The current work is the first to document the robust existence of gender bias in the perception of others’ fatigue and points towards interventions to help mitigate these biases in practice.
It is generally assumed that our advanced, technological civilization will find a way to surmount our planet’s multifaceted climate and ecological crisis. In everyday thinking, it is virtually unthinkable to assume that our environmental situation could lead to a catastrophic outcome in which our civilization collapses and the planet becomes uninhabitable for humans. Of course, no one knows what the future holds, and humanity may yet find creative ways to surmount the crisis. But there are powerful political, economic, and cultural forces clearly putting us on a catastrophic trajectory unless fundamental (and increasingly difficult and improbable) changes are made. If we were, however, to contemplate, as one possibility, a truly worse-case scenario, it would seem important for religious persons to ask how religion and theology might function under such extreme conditions. Two fundamental questions might then arise: (1) From a practical perspective, how might religious faith be best practiced as conditions radically worsen? (2) And how might religion and theology best interpret such a fateful trajectory of decline and destruction? The author proposes a practice-oriented concept of practical theology, and certain related revisions of traditional Christian theological teachings, that may be helpful in answering such questions.
The Covid-19 pandemic had a disproportionate impact on the vulnerable sections of society, including children. While fall in nutritional status and gap in education are well-recorded, the heighted risk of exploitation faced by children is less researched. This article traces the impact of the pandemic on child trafficking in India. The domains that were explored were if there had been a rise in child trafficking due to the pandemic, what were the forms of exploitation witnessed, if any new strategies of recruitment had been created by the pandemic and the measures taken by the state during the period. The methodology was content analysis and thematic analysis of articles in national dailies in English in India from March 2020 when a lockdown was imposed to October 2021 when schools finally reopened. The study found that the period saw a surge in child trafficking as evidenced by rescues. Labour trafficking emerged as the dominant form as compared to trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation and sale of babies. There was a surge in bride trafficking too. Two new forms of exploitation that were witnessed were auctioning of Covid orphans and induction of very young children into crime. Traditional recruitment methods such as word of mouth reference continued but technology in the form of social media platforms emerged as new pathways of recruitment. Disaster relief to affected communities was also adopted by traffickers to gain the trust of vulnerable families with targeted children. The state issued advisories to law enforcement for rescue and to local governments for prevention measures. Content analysis revealed these trends while latent thematic analysis gave information about the network structure of the trafficking business, evidence of presence of organized crime in some forms of exploitation and the embeddedness of the trafficking business in the legal economy.
Township tourism has evolved as a niche tourism offering in South Africa with the potential to create economic opportunities in townships. The experiences of tourists as expressed on online platforms are important barometers of what tourist offerings are working or not. This study analyses the star ratings of and written feedback about tourist attractions in Langa and Gugulethu in Cape Town, as posted on Google Reviews. A quantitative analysis of 9124 Google Review star ratings to ascertain the general ratings of 81 tourist attractions in the study areas yielded results of 3.9 and 4 out of five in Langa and Gugulethu, respectively. A content analysis was performed of 3340 written reviews on the online platform. The nine themes that emerged are discussed in the paper, namely overall experience; importance of history, culture and heritage; infrastructure concerns; safety issues; gastronomic experience; venue aesthetics; customer service; entertainment offerings; and community service and development. The study confirms that reviews from online platforms have the potential to improve the township tourism offering.
This study examines the dynamics of networks among informal recyclers in Fietas, Johannesburg, South Africa, focussing on how these networks embody their struggle for the "Right to the City." By observing informal recycling activities across various Johannesburg suburbs, the study highlights how recycling not only provides livelihoods for the unemployed but also allows marginalised groups to assert their presence and rights within the cityscape. Building upon Adama's (2012) analysis of urban livelihoods and social networks, this research explores the interactions and spatial practices of informal recyclers in Johannesburg. Informal recyclers develop connections with city stakeholders that demonstrate interdependencies crucial for their survival and claiming space within the city. These networks are vital for accessing resources such as recyclable waste, which provides essential needs like food and shelter. These everyday practices underscore the importance of social connections in building networks that sustain livelihoods and assert a right to belong in the city. The nature of these networks varies by location, policies, and social relations. Some are shaped by power dynamics and monopolies, while others reflect interdependence and mutual support. This paper argues that recognising these diverse networks is key to understanding how informal recyclers navigate the urban landscape. In line with Harvey's (2003) "Right to the City," these networks reflect efforts to reshape urban spaces to meet recyclers' needs, despite structural challenges. As Sung (2021) shows, hierarchies and power dynamics influence access to resources, highlighting the contested nature of urban life for informal recyclers.
Equity-denied families report barriers to accessing parenting supports, and online programs have the potential to improve accessibility. First Pathways is a digital parenting program designed to promote parent-child interactions and children’s development by sharing parent-child interactive activity ideas and knowledge of how these activities support children’s brain development. We recruited equity-denied families from community organizations and via snowball sampling to investigate the effect of playing First Pathways on parent-child interactions and child development for parents and their children aged 3–36 months. We also examined predictors of game play. Parent-child dyads participated in a 2-month randomized controlled trial pilot study. The First Pathways group received daily reminders encouraging game utilization for one month. Parent-child interactions and children’s development were reassessed at 1- and 2-months. Although no significant group differences were found between the First Pathways and waitlist control group, the quartile of dyads who played First Pathways the most (n= 13) demonstrated significantly greater improvements in parent-child interactions compared to dyads (n= 12) who played the least. Moreover, total game play over the 2-month study was significantly correlated with improvements in parent-child interactions. Dyads were significantly more likely to play First Pathways while receiving reminders, and early play predicted later play. Dyads who showed the greatest reciprocity in their interactions (i.e., balanced back and forth serve and return exchanges) at baseline were most likely to have greater game play. Online programs have potential to support parent-child interactions and child development for equity-denied families; additional research is needed to understand facilitators/barriers to early engagement.
The subjective happiness scale (SHS) is a brief instrument used to measure global subjective happiness that has been translated from its original English to many other languages. To date, there is no reported translation of this scale into Malayalam, a language spoken by over 32 million people especially in the southern state of Kerala, India. In the present study, 656 community-dwelling older adults participating in the Kerala Einstein study (KES) completed the Malayalam version of the SHS. The Malayalam version demonstrated high internal consistency and good convergent validity, as assessed by comparison to measures of depression and anxiety. We also used factor analysis to determine that the Malayalam version of the SHS has a unidimensional structure, akin to the original English as well as other language adaptations. Our study adds to the repertoire of tools to measure happiness in non-English-speaking populations, enabling future research to explore the foundations of well-being across diverse cultures.
Little is known about differences in child developmental vulnerability before school entry according to maternal birthplace and sex. Official immigration records were linked with the Early Development Instrument assessments among children in kindergarten in the province of Manitoba, Canada (2005–2017). Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of vulnerability in five developmental domains associated with maternal birthplace and child sex. Children of immigrant mothers from most birthplaces had higher adjusted odds of developmental vulnerability than non-immigrants in domains related to language and communication skills, except those of the rest of North America & Oceania. Children of Sub-Saharan African mothers were more vulnerable in four domains. Boys were consistently more vulnerable than girls across domains and maternal birthplaces. Children of immigrant mothers exhibited higher developmental vulnerability than non-immigrants in domains related to language and communication skills, potentially reflecting exposure to English and French as second languages.
PurposeArthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) describes a heterogeneous group of rare congenital conditions. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) may be reduced in AMC due to broadly heterogeneous physical impairments and participation limitations. This study described HRQL in children and youth with AMC, compared HRQL between child self- and parent-proxy reports, and identified factors associated with better/worse HRQL.MethodsData on 205 children with AMC (age 8–21 years) from a North American AMC registry across eight hospital sites was used. HRQL was assessed cross-sectionally using the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-Youth-3 Levels (EQ-5D-Y-3 L) by self-report, parent proxy-report or both.ResultsMean child-reported PROMIS T-scores were significantly lower than the normal mean for the Upper Extremity (mean = 33.0) and Mobility (mean = 37.2) but in the normal range for Pain Interference (mean = 46.6) and Peer Relationships (mean = 51.7). A lot of problems in EQ-5D-Y-3 L was reported by 37% in Feeling Worried/ Sad/ Unhappy, 46% in Having Pain/Discomfort, 50% in Doing Usual Activities, 56% in Mobility, and 57% in Looking After Myself. Compared to child-report, parents reported significantly worse PROMIS T-scores and higher problems in EQ-5D domains. Wheelchair use, being small for gestational age, prolonged hospitalization after birth, increased number of orthopedic surgeries, and caregiver’s stress were associated with lower HRQL scores.ConclusionFindings indicate the importance of considering both the child’s and parents’ reports of HRQL, and to provide multimodal interventions that focus on the effect of childhood and parental characteristics to promote HRQL among children with AMC.
Evidence-based early intervention programs for children at risk of developing psychological problems after exposure to armed conflict have been recommended as a major component in the treatment of psychosocial problems. This study examines the efficacy of a pilot school-based mindfulness intervention (SMI) and its impact on the social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes of war-affected refugee preschool children living in a refugee camp in Türkiye. A single-blind randomized controlled trial with pre-test and post-test design was employed. A total of 76 participants (born in 2013) were randomized by the school into the 6-week intervention (n= 38) or the control group (n= 38). Measures included the State Self-Esteem Scale, Early Childhood Social Skill Measure, and the Child and Youth Resilience Measure-Revised. GLM repeated-measures ANOVA (p< 0,05) analysis showed positive effects of SMI on social skills (F = 126.06,p< 0.05, η2 = 0.63), self-esteem (F = 72.08,p< 0.05, η2 = 0.49) and resilience (F = 4.33,p< 0.05, η2 = 0.05) over time for the intervention group as compared to controls. Significant reductions in social and emotional problems were found for children who reported high levels of introversion in the pre-test. Pilot study results support SMI as a promising intervention for psychosocial problems that can reduce stress and anxiety symptoms among children exposed to armed conflict and forced migration.
This research explores the relationship between personal belief in a just world (PBJW), gratitude, and forgiveness within the context of middle-aged adults in India. While prior research has established links between PBJW and forgiveness, this investigation delves deeper, examining how gratitude moderates these relationships. The primary objective is to unveil how gratitude moderates the connection between PBJW and forgiveness, filling a significant research gap within the Indian context. The researchers collected data from 386 middle-aged Indian adults through online and offline surveys. The study reveals a positive but weak correlation between PBJW and forgiveness. Gratitude significantly moderates this relationship, amplifying the impact of PBJW on forgiveness. These discoveries offer fresh insights into the complex dynamics underlying forgiveness processes among middle-aged adults in India, addressing a critical gap in the existing research landscape within this cultural context. Practical implications are drawn for counselors and formators that support efforts to promote forgiveness and enhance interpersonal harmony and psychological health.
Sexual satisfaction, adjustment to aging, and satisfaction with life are relevant dimensions of overall well-being across the life cycle. Through cluster analysis procedures, this study aims to describe the specific profile of adjustment to aging, sexual satisfaction and satisfaction with life of adults across the life span. This cross-sectional study involved a community-based sample of 619 Portuguese individuals, aged between 18 and 92 years old (M= 47.53SD= 18.34) evaluated using a two-step cluster analysis. Fours clusters emerged. Themost adjustedparticipants were mostly of a younger age, women and had a high education. Theleast adjustedparticipants globally presented low education, poor perceived health, and poor engagement in leisure activities.Well-being focusedparticipants were mostly women of older age, with high education and spirituality. Finally,moderately satisfiedparticipants were mostly men of older age, had a lower education, and presented poor reported health. Complementary comparative analysis among the identified subgroups was performed. Themost adjustedparticipants had the highest perceived overall sexual well-being, sexual attractiveness, sexual openness and communication, and sexual satisfaction. These data characterize the profile of this population and can be used as the basis for developing efficient strategies aimed a combining adjustment to aging, satisfaction with life and sexual satisfaction for tailored interventions to the specific needs of populations across the lifespan.
This study examines the relationships of financial decision-making power, spousal relative resources, and personal financial characteristics with financial satisfaction. Using a sample of young American women with lower income who were married or cohabiting (N = 303), we found that women with higher financial decision-making power in savings and investments as well as in managing regular bills than their spouses were more likely to have higher financial satisfaction compared to women with spouses having higher financial decision-making power. These associations were derived from married women, rather than cohabiting women. Interestingly, women with higher incomes than their spouses reported a lower level of financial satisfaction compared to women with spouses having a higher income. The same pattern was observed for spousal relative education. Subjective financial knowledge had a positive association with financial satisfaction. We also examined potential moderating roles of education, which suggests that women with higher education had a more pronounced association between financial decision-making power in savings and investments and higher financial satisfaction. Our findings provide implications for policymakers, financial service providers, and family life practitioners to potentially reduce gender inequality in intrahousehold financial decision-making, which ultimately benefits financially vulnerable women’s financial satisfaction.
This article analyzes the phenomenon of “attacking”, a slang term referring to a common Israeli heterosexual script for casual sexual interactions in youth nightclubs, in order to reveal different affective relations that inform young women’s intensified vulnerability and sexual expression. Based on the theory of vulnerability and the theory of affect, it applies the relational standpoint to suggest the ambiguity of the affective atmosphere as a path to rethinking young women’s sexual expression in youth leisure spaces. Based on 39 semi-structured interviews with young women aged 18–23, this framework uses a wide range of affective responses as epistemic resources. The findings show how the affective atmosphere in “attacking” spaces reflects blurred social boundaries, intensified vulnerability, and affective relations, all of which inform young women’s sexual expression. They demonstrate the manifestations of the gender role division but also show how young women’s vulnerability serves as an affective resource for subjectification. The findings contribute to theorizing young women’s vulnerability as ambiguous, revealing how the leisure space offers different affective experiences – some deconstruct the subject, while others allow relational subjectification.
Place attachment is the cognitive-emotional bond individuals develop for physical locations. It can develop toward residential settings and is often associated with positive emotions and psychological and physical comfort. Literature in social work, and other social sciences, lack an exploration of the physical features that contribute to the development of place attachment toward residences for children in foster care. Using a retrospective mixed-methods design, this study examines the physical attributes of North American foster care environments that did—or did not—encourage place attachment in foster children between the ages of 7–12. Participants recalled a low level of place attachment toward their foster residences; place attachment and participants’ ease of recall of a foster residence were positively correlated. Perceived impact of the physical environment on sense of comfort in a foster home was neutral. Three open-ended items revealed themes concerned with "furniture,” “entertainment,” specific “structural features,” and “outdoor attributes” contributed to the development of place attachment toward past residences, while “inadequate space,” “aesthetics and ambience,” and “lack of cleanliness and organization” did not contribute to place attachment. “Outdoor attributes,” “adequate space,” and “entertainment” were noted as desirable in foster residences to facilitate the development of place attachment. This study may guide social workers and government administrators in understanding links between the physical attributes of foster homes and children’s psychoemotional responses. It adds to a small but growing number of studies at the intersection of social work and environmental psychology that may improve quality of life for children in foster care.
Rural governance is crucial for sustainable development but often faces challenges like limited resources, geographic isolation, and diverse stakeholder interests. This research addresses the gap in integrating collaborative governance frameworks within rural settings by applying Soft System Methodology (SSM) and Textual Network Analysis (TNA) to enhance governance strategies. Combining SSM, a methodology designed for complex problems, with TNA, the research identifies key factors such as inclusivity, communication, and capacity building as essential for effective stakeholder engagement in rural governance. This integrated approach ensures that governance strategies remain adaptable to evolving challenges. The findings demonstrate that applying SSM and collaborative governance frameworks improves rural governance practices by creating more participatory and responsive systems that better meet the needs of rural communities. This contribution provides a practical solution to enhancing governance in rural areas, leading to sustainable improvements.
Low plant awareness has been described for the general public, academics, and students from elementary to university level. Here we describe the proportion of plants in biodiversity inventories conducted by 110 undergraduate students enrolled in animal-related degrees at a rural Brazilian university. Observations were collected during three practical courses and were submitted to a global citizen-science platform. Students collected a predetermined number of observations in three months, which probably contributed to the similar temporal patterns of animal and plant observations. In total, plants represented 60% of observations and plants-to-animals ratio per student was not affected by gender. While plants were better represented, most observations depicted planted urban trees and other cultivated or potted plants. Being sessile, plants are easier to observe and photograph than animals. Using a citizen-science platform can increase perception of plants as an essential part of local biodiversity, building a better ground for global plant conservation.
At key moments in history, political understanding and action are irrevocably transformed. What makes such moments of transformation possible? This article examines the emergence of African nationalism in South Africa, following the multivocal appeal to African nationhood made by proto-nationalist leaders and intellectuals. In doing so I examine how new political imagination can reconfigure the structure of political relations and create powerful new possibilities for political organizing and action. African proto-nationalist leaders were ‘intermediary intellectuals’ who used African nationhood to speak to three different political logics of their key audiences: a ‘progressive nationhood’ to their white colonial audience, a ‘unifying nationhood’ to their missionary-educated African audience, and a ‘traditional nationhood’ to their rural African audience. African nationhood thus had a multivocal appeal which allowed proto-nationalist leaders to bring otherwise divided audiences to support a common political project. By bridging these divided communities, proto-nationalist leaders were able to combine resources and strategies from once separated domains into novel forms of political power. Transformation in political understanding was thus a critical enabler of innovation in organization and action because it built a political project where new connections between African and colonial worlds were made politically ‘thinkable’. Speaking to the scholarship on political repertoires and the sociology of anti-colonial intellectuals, this study has broader implications for the role political ideas play in political transformation.
There is a heightened concern for young children’s excessive use of screen devices and the need to understand its antecedents. This study aimed to examine mothers’ beliefs about the risks and benefits of using screen devices and how these beliefs, along with mothers’ own entertainment screen time, relate to preschool children’s screen time. The sample included 196 mothers of 2.5–4.5-year-old children in Estonia. Mothers reported their beliefs regarding children’s use of screen devices as well as their own and children’s screen time. The findings showed that mothers considered the use of screen devices most beneficial for children’s knowledge acquisition, math skills, and speaking skills, and most harmful to children’s sleep and physical activity. Higher socioeconomic status predicted mothers’ less positive views about screen devices and mothers’ and children’s lower screen time. The less mothers used screen devices for entertainment at the weekend and the less positive views they had about screen device use, the lower was their children’s screen time on weekdays and weekend days.
Interventions targeting nutrition and physical activity levels of pre-schoolers through early childhood education and care (ECEC) increasingly aim to involve families and the home setting. How to optimise the reach and adoption of interventions by parents remains an important question. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a take-home kit to promote nutrition and physical activity (PA) of pre-schoolers at home, while exploring the participatory approach of its development, implementation and evaluation. Three successive versions of the take-home kit were developed and distributed among 21 ECEC centres and 199 families in South-Limburg, the Netherlands. Acceptability and feasibility of the kit were monitored and acted upon throughout the research period. The take-home kit included a stuffed toy, PA and nutrition cards with simple activities, a journal in which parents were asked to record their activities, and written instructions. One kit per ECEC centre rotated between families. Thirty-seven parents participated in open-ended questionnaires, and ECEC teachers from six centres and five implementers participated in interviews. Both questionnaires and interviews included questions about the acceptability (i.e. content, design), feasibility and self-reported impact of the take-home kit. Parents appreciated the tangible and practical aspects of the materials. Using children’s play experience and clear instructions from ECEC teachers facilitated implementation at home. Both implementers and ECEC teachers needed room for contextualised solutions to barriers to implementing the take-home kit in practice. Based on the present study, we conclude that take-home kits can be a valuable tool for ECEC to reach and support parents in adopting healthy energy balance-related behaviours at home.
Math language plays a crucial role in early math skill development. However, previous studies have measured math language using children’s knowledge or the environmental input of mathematical language, often limiting the scope to specific types of mathematical language. This study examined both numerical (e.g., number-related) and non-numerical (e.g., geometry, measurement, and spatial relations) mathematical expressions used by parents and young children during play and explored how combinations of these math language types related to early math skills. Fifty-eight children aged four to six years and their parents participated in laboratory-based tasks, including a 15-minute play session and a standardized math assessment. The results showed that numerical and non-numerical expressions were used at similar frequencies, and there were strong correlations between parents’ and children’s math language across various types. Mediation analyses revealed that children’s use of math language mediated the relation between the mathematical input they received and their early math skills, but this effect emerged only when advanced numerical and geometry language was considered. These findings emphasize the significance of children’s active use of math language and highlight the need to integrate numerical and non-numerical content in research on early mathematical development.
Despite the well-established significance of positive paternal involvement in coparenting for the well-being of children and mothers, father involvement in coparenting tends to be significantly lower than that of the mothers. Additionally, there is a lack of empirical studies on Chinese migrant fathers and their participation in coparenting, and the specific manifestations and underlying causes of reported lower parental coparenting by mothers remain unclear. Given the importance of parental coparenting, this qualitative study aimed to investigate maternal perceptions regarding paternal involvement in coparenting, and examine specific parental practices related to coparenting in daily life within migrant families in a natural and dynamic context. Informed by thematic analysis, semi-structured, one-on-one interviews were held with 16 migrant mothers in China. Two major themes were identified: (1) the meaning of paternal coparenting (e.g., meaning for mothers and meaning for children), and (2) the practice of paternal coparenting (e.g., labour division, cooperation, conflict). The variation in coparenting behaviors exhibited by fathers can be attributed to the alignment of their parenting concepts with those of mothers, as well as the effectiveness of negotiation between them. The findings highlight the importance of considering parental involvement and collaboration with mothers when studying coparenting dynamics in migrant families. These insights can serve as a valuable reference for service providers and policymakers involved in supporting parents of migrant children to enhance their collaborative coparenting.
ObjectiveTo investigate the reliability of parental recall of birth weight, birth length and gestational age several years after birth.MethodsParentally recalled birth parameters were obtained from the European multicentric cohort study IDEFICS (Identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants) and compared to the corresponding data externally recorded in the child’s medical check-up booklet. The agreement between the two sources was examined using Bland–Altman plots, intraclass correlation coefficients and Cohen’s kappa for clinically relevant categories. Additionally, logistic regression models were used to identify factors related to parental recall accuracy.ResultsA total of 4930 children aged 2 to 11 years were included. Accuracy of birth weight within 100 g was 88%, 94% of the recalled birth length was within 2 cm, and 99% of the parents could recall with 2 weeks accuracy how many weeks their child was delivered preterm. Discrepancies of more than two weeks or more than 100 g were more likely in parents of low or medium socioeconomic status. Non-biological parents were 3.4 times more likely to have a discrepancy of more than 100 g compared to biological mothers (95% CI 1.7–6.7). Moreover, parents were less likely to accurately recall their child’s birth parameters with increasing number of children within a family.Conclusions for Practice.In general, parents’ information matched well with the medical check-up booklet. However, accuracy varied among different groups which should be taken into consideration when using birth data recalled by parents in studies of child health.
In Ghana, the artisanal or small-scale fishing community observes an annual closed season in July, while industrial trawl vessels observe theirs in August. To ascertain how the closed season affects operations, livelihood, and coping strategies of small-scale fishers, we conducted a study in four fishing communities: James Town and Chorkor in the Greater Accra Region and New Takoradi and Nkotompo in the Western Region. We administered a structured questionnaire to gather information on fishers’ socio-economic characteristics and coping strategies during the closed season, their familiarity with the ban, their degree of compliance, the availability of economic relief or government support, and issues related to difficulties in adhering to the annual closed season and the ban’s effects on catch characteristics (based on prior experience). We used STATA 17 software, an extended linear regression model (ERM), descriptive statistics as well as correlation matrix to analyze the data obtained from the questionnaire. Our results indicate that fishers’ coping strategies during the closed season include reliance on savings (96.50%), reduction in expenses (88.50%), and asking relatives for help (72.50%). Lower income (91.50%), high expenses (76.00%), and inability to pay bills (68.50%) are the top three challenges faced by fishers during the closed season. According to the outcome equation, Chorkor’s pre-ban and post-ban catch will likely be higher than Jamestown, New Takoradi, and Nkontompo’s. However, pre-ban and post-ban income is likely lower in Chorkor than in James Town, Takoradi, and Nkontompo. Fishers who catch 100–199 kg of fish per trip are likely to see an increase in the capture, while those who capture less than 100 kg are likely to capture less after the ban, although it is not significant.
This research examines the connection between cultural attachment within Canada’s Indigenous population and the job satisfaction of employed adults. Using the 2017 Aboriginal Peoples Survey, we explore the influence of their cultural attachment on job satisfaction for four generations and across First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Indigenous identities. The cultural attachment social indicator was first created with an index based on four belonging questions and then adjusted for measurement errors. Findings show a positive relationship between cultural attachment and job satisfaction, with the probability of job satisfaction increasing as cultural attachment increases, especially for those who have a high level of cultural attachment with their community. Analysis by age group finds a robust association between cultural attachment and job satisfaction for the four generations: Boomers, Generation X, Y, and Z. The study finds an association between cultural attachment and job satisfaction for all three Indigenous subgroups. The Inuit have the largest cultural attachment effect, followed by First Nations and then Métis. The results emphasize the significance of diversity in organizational settings and the role of cultural attachment within communities in promoting organizational job satisfaction. The findings suggest that policies and practices promoting culture bonding may improve job satisfaction and, thus, performance.
Unfortunately, the retention rate of foster parents is low, and multiple challenges exist for agencies in maintaining long-term foster parents. Research examining perceptions of recruiting and licensing foster parents may provide some insight into supporting future foster parent recruitment and training for child welfare professionals. This study utilized administrative data from the state of Florida to examine and compare the perspectives of foster parents and child welfare workers regarding the recruitment and licensing of foster homes. This cross-sectional administrative survey included a total of 1,249 foster parents and child welfare workers in the state of Florida. Descriptive statistics and Mann-WhitneyUtests were used to examine the perspectives of foster parents and child welfare workers across multiple questions related to the need for foster homes and recruitment and licensing processes. Results indicate that caseworkers and foster parents in this sample generally held different perspectives across most of the questions related to the need for foster homes, recruitment and licensing practices. Implications for recruiting and licensing foster homes and the need for consistent and accurate messaging to both foster parents and child welfare workers are discussed. More research is needed to explore recruitment and licensing processes, particularly research-supported strategies that have not been well-tested among foster care samples.
PurposeA substantial number of people experience a persisting impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after COVID-19. The current study aims to identify different trajectories of physical and mental HRQoL, fatigue severity, and dyspnoea severity following hospitalisation with COVID-19, and associated factors of these trajectories.Methods500 patients with COVID-19 were followed for one year in a longitudinal cohort study. Self-reported outcomes were measured at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after hospitalisation. Distinct trajectories were characterised using Growth Mixture Modelling. Sociodemographic and clinical correlates of trajectories were investigated using multivariable (multinomial) logistic regression analyses.ResultsThree trajectories (‘stable high’ (16%), ‘improving’ (40%), and ‘stable low’ (44%)) were found for physical HRQoL, and four (‘stable high’ (43%), ‘improving’ (14%), ‘middle declining’ (17%), and ‘low’ (26%)) for mental HRQoL. Older age, overweight and obesity, lower education, and comorbidities were associated with ‘low’ physical HRQoL. Younger age was associated with ‘low’ mental HRQoL. Four fatigue trajectories (‘no fatigue’ (15%), ‘improving’ (40%), ‘low-severe’ (27%), and ‘high-severe’ (18%)) were found. Participants either experienced almost never (‘no dyspnoea’, 75%) or almost always (‘severe’, 25%) dyspnoea. High co-occurrences between low HRQoL and severe fatigue and dyspnoea symptom trajectories were found.ConclusionA substantial number of COVID-19 survivors continue to struggle with reduced HRQoL over time. However, large variations in these physical and mental HRQoL trajectories exist, and trajectories are associated with persisting COVID-19-related symptoms or pre-hospitalised health status. Regular measurement of HRQoL and post-COVID symptoms may help identify those that may benefit from timely interventions.
In 2016, the United States Army removed its ban on women working in combat roles in previously reserved jobs for men. This policy change included a concerted effort by Army leadership to ensure women felt included in their new roles. Nevertheless, the immediate response to the policy changes led to mixed results in translating and implementing these new policies. This study takes qualitative data from a study on diversity and inclusion policy and practices to investigate women’s experiences working in various roles in 2019. We collected qualitative data from 19 focus groups and 120 soldiers in 2019 from four Army installations across the United States. An inductive analysis of focus group interviews revealed three major themes: social exclusion due to gender, updated policies to include women, sexism, and gender harassment. Since inclusion is an interpersonal experience, the themes were analyzed through an intersectional template to see if race and rank also played a role in women's experiences in combat roles. These findings provide a more nuanced and lived experience perspective on being a woman serving in combat in the United States Army.
PurposeFamily caregivers of care-dependent patients experience a decline in their Quality of Life (QoL). However, the determinants contributing to this decrease in QoL are still not fully understood. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate prospectively the determinants contributing to decreased QoL among family caregivers of care-dependent patients.MethodsThis longitudinal study involved 135 family caregivers in Brazil. Data were collected at baseline from October 2016 to August 2017, and at follow-up from December 2021 to July 2022. During both periods, we administered a questionnaire that covered sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle characteristics of the participants; the Barthel Index to assess the dependency level of the patients; and the WHOQOL-bref to assess the caregivers’ QoL.ResultsBoth caregivers and care-dependent patients were more frequently elderly (44.4%versus74.6%), female (79.3%versus61.5%), and had non-communicable disease (60.0%versus94.3%) at baseline. Most patients experienced a worsening in their level of dependency (59.8%), while over a third of family caregivers (34.8%) reported a decline in their General Quality of Life Index. Eight determinants of decreased QoL were identified: four protective factors (religious faith, physical activity, sharing caregiving responsibilities, and sufficient sleep) and four risk factors (patient hospitalization in the past year, patient increased care dependency, older family caregiver age, and longer caregiving duration).ConclusionMany factors influencing caregiver QoL are modifiable through intervention, underscoring the need for public policies to support family caregivers. Healthcare professionals can play a vital role in promoting protective factors and addressing risk factors to enhance caregiver QoL.
Young people today are expected to navigate their precarious careers in an entrepreneurial way. Self-employment is gaining ground on wage labour as one attractive strategy for winning the battle with precariousness. From Granovetter’s studies to the present day, one of the most prolific lines of research on the factors influencing the strategies of job insertion emphasises the key importance of personal networks. Based on social capital theory, this article tests (1) whether the composition of young people’s personal networks is associated with their desire to move towards independent careers; and (2) whether, among the mechanisms associated with this orientation, there is the ability to mobilise contacts’ resources, for example, avoiding conflict and exploiting different forms of social support. Analysing data on the personal networks of a sample of 7827 young people in Switzerland, our results show that the orientation towards self-employment is more likely for those who access contacts with an unfavourable position in the labour market, such as people with lower educational levels and a foreign background. Although receiving social support plays a role, our results show that, for young people wishing to become self-employed, an even more important predictor is the presence of conflicts in their networks. In the context of the precarization of young people’s labour pathways, these results suggest that self-employment can serve as a coping strategy for the most vulnerable, as well as an escape from difficult relationships.
This study investigates translation strategies that enhance idea generation and linguistic construction in early childhood composing, focusing on high language-growth prekindergarten to first-grade classrooms. Our sample included 28 teachers from two under-resourced districts in the Northeastern United States, serving 324 children. Using an exploratory sequential mixed-method approach, we analyzed 28 video recordings of small group composing sessions to identify specific strategies employed by teachers. We found teachers’ use of strategies for idea generation and language construction were positively associated with children's receptive vocabulary growth. Teachers in high language-growth classrooms were approximately three and half times more likely to use translation strategies than teachers in low language-growth classrooms. Five strategies emerged that facilitate memory retrieval, comparative thinking, and idea synthesis related to idea generation. Additionally, five strategies related to language construction emerged for transitioning children’s language from contextualized to decontextualized forms, enhancing vocabulary, and constructing more complex sentences. These insights provide a framework for teachers to support early writing development through targeted and intentional instructional strategies to facilitate the idea-language translation process, thereby promoting significant gains in children's language skills.
To date, little is known about body image and eating concerns among men in midlife. To bridge this gap in the literature, this study tested an adapted and integrated sociocultural model of body image and eating concerns among men in midlife. A sample of men (N= 213) between the ages of 45 and 60 years living in the United States completed an online survey and reported on sociocultural pressures from media, friends, family and partners, body image in younger years, internalization of a youthful lean and muscular ideal, appearance comparison, sexual objectification, body dissatisfaction, attitudes towards muscularity, drive for leanness and thinness, participation in muscularity-oriented behaviors, and restrictive eating. After modification, the final model revealed good fit to the data. Although not all predicted pathways were supported, overall, interpersonal and media pressures were related to internalization of ideals and appearance comparison. In turn, internalization and comparison were related to higher body dissatisfaction, drive for leanness and muscularity, and engagement in muscularity-oriented behaviors and restrictive eating. Findings support the usefulness of an adapted and integrated sociocultural model of body image and eating concerns in midlife men. The model suggests that the pressures that may increase body image and eating concerns in younger men may also be relevant in midlife men. Findings also highlight the usefulness of considering age-specific body-change behaviors and disordered eating in midlife men.
Drawing upon the refined version of identity theory, this study examined whether the indirect path from father role identity salience (FRIS) to paternal psychological well-being via father involvement would differ depending on within- and outside-family contexts (i.e., the presence of preschool-aged child[ren] and work-to-family conflict [WFC]). To examine the moderated mediation hypothesis, multigroup path analysis with the bootstrapping method was conducted using self-reports of working fathers with a child[ren] under 18 years old (N= 244). Results revealed that the direct association between greater FRIS and better paternal psychological well-being was significant regardless of the presence of preschool children or levels of WFC. The indirect association through father involvement was 1) significant for fathers both with and without preschool-aged children, but significantly greater for fathers with preschoolers, and 2) only significant for fathers with low WFC. To enhance fathers’ well-being, more efforts are necessary to support the enactment of father identity and to create father-friendly workplaces.
ObjectivesAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with biological, multicausal and polygenic origins. The true prevalence of ASD has not been clearly established. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of ASD in children aged 3 to 14 years in Spain and to analyze the factors associated with it.MethodsA cross-sectional observational study using data from the 2017 National Survey of Health in Minors in Spain. Primary outcome was the diagnosis of ASD, and sociodemographic, behavioral, health-related, the use of health services, household and medication use variables was analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression model with a correction for modelling rare events was fitted. Complex sampling was undertaken, using the survey elevation factor in the analysis.ResultsA total of 4409 children were included, and there were 26 children with ASD, for a prevalence of 0.59%, representing 29,143 children with ASD. Factors significantly associated were male sex, having visited a psychologist, and/or a speech therapist in the past year, presenting probable problems with peers, antisocial behavior, taking antibiotics and taking other medications.ConclusionThe findings of this study may be useful to inform health policies and develop strategic plans to identify and address the needs of children with ASD.
Researchers can unintentionally reinforce societal prejudice against minoritized populations through the false assumption that psychological measurements are generalizable across identities. Recently, researchers have posited that gender and sexually diverse (GSD) people could feel excluded or confused by the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) due to its overtly heteronormative statements like “A man is incomplete without the love of a woman.” Yet, the ASI is used for indexing the endorsement of sexism in GSD samples and across diverse populations. An ideal test of these experiences is to directly consult GSD participants for their reactions. In the current study, we report a reflexive thematic analysis of lesbian women and gay men’s (N= 744) feedback immediately after completing the ASI. Four themes characterized participants’ reactions to the ASI:Exclusion: Heteronormative items erase diverse genders and sexualities,Confusion: Inability to meaningfully respond due to heteronormativity,Hope: Exclusion understood as a necessary sacrifice toward progress, andDistress: Exclusion inflicts distress by reflecting societal prejudice. The themes captured the experience that many participants found heteronormative assumptions salient in the ASI and had varied reactions to the heteronormativity. Our results extend prior research that questions the generalizability of results drawn from the ASI, especially studies including GSD participants. We discuss the implications of the continued use of the ASI and encourage researchers to critically evaluate underlying theories and assumptions to ensure participants can engage with measures as intended.
In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of resilience or public service motivation (PSM) on firefighters’ work engagement during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We conducted an online survey with 304 firefighters assigned to Gyeonggi-do between October 27 and 28, 2022, and collected their demographic information; work-related data; mood, anxiety and insomnia symptoms; and work-related attitudes. The leading causes of firefighters’ stress were physical and mental health decline due to heavy workloads (46.4%), verbal abuse and assault from civilians (33.9%), conflict with coworkers (18.4%), and death of colleagues (13.2%). The results of the logistic regression analysis revealed that high levels of resilience (OR = 1.28,p< 0.001), service motivation (OR = 1.17,p< 0.001), and non-exposure to death (OR = 0.33,p= 0.005) led to high work engagement. Mediation analysis showed that resilience and PSM mediated the influence of depression on work engagement. The work engagement of firefighters is influenced by resilience, PSM, and exposure to death.
Postmaterialism has long been considered an expressive value embraced by certain cohorts who grew up in a relatively wealthy environment. This study challenges this generational replacement hypothesis and suggests that value shifts in a population often can be attributed to period effects. By simultaneously observing the changing value trends of the US, Japan, Türkiye and China over 20 years on the basis of the data of the World Values Survey, this study performs an age-period-cohort analysis to effectively differentiate the otherwise knotted effects of age, period and cohort in contexts of different income levels and cultural backgrounds. The results show that cohort characteristics are less obvious than the influences brought about by specific period factors. Additionally, religion appear to be highly influential. Two important contributions are noted. First, more effective estimation of age, period and cohort effects is a necessity for advancing strong evidence-based arguments to understand value shifts toward postmaterialism. Second, subscribing to a new, different value position at a societal level can happen in a short duration with observable cross-sectional differences whose underlying logics need more research attention.
The lack of a cohesive, stakeholder-informed refugee health research agenda has been a barrier to promoting, funding, and conducting health research with refugee populations in North America. A cross-sectional study was conducted among individuals working in refugee health in North America (N= 93) to describe major domains within the field of refugee health research and to develop refugee health research priorities. Open-ended survey questions included: (1) What research topics specific to refugee research would you like to see in an international research agenda? (2) Please describe current and important gaps that you believe exist in refugee research and why? Overarching themes focused on the need for the development of research partnerships with refugee communities that are intentional, effective, and driven by the needs of refugee communities. The survey also identified a need for best practices in creating sustainable, community-based research partnerships (effective models and evidence-based strategies) that translate across 12 domains. The refugee health research priorities for North America described in this manuscript should continue to be modified over time as political, economic, social, and medical contexts change.
ObjectivesDevelopment and validation of risk prediction models at mid-pregnancy and delivery to predict admission to the neonatal care unit.MethodsWe used data from all singleton deliveries at Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH), Ireland during 2019. Admission to the neonatal care unit was assumed if length of stay in the unit was > 24 h. Multivariable logistic regression with backward stepwise selection was used to develop the models. Discrimination was assessed using the ROC curve C-statistic, and internal validation was assessed using bootstrapping techniques. We conducted temporal external validation using data from all singleton deliveries at CUMH during 2020.ResultsOut of 6,077 women, 5,809 (95.6%) with complete data were included in the analyses. A total of 612 infants (10.54%) were admitted to the neonatal care unit for > 24 hours. Six variables were informative at mid-pregnancy: male infants, maternal smoking, advancing maternal age, maternal overweight/obesity, nulliparity and history of gestational diabetes (C-statistic: 0.600, 95% CI: 0.567, 0.614). Seven variables were informative at delivery: male infants, nulliparity, public antenatal care, gestational age < 39 weeks’, non-spontaneous vaginal delivery, premature rupture of membranes and time of birth between 17:01–07.59 h (C-statistic: 0.738, 95% CI: 0.715, 0.760). Using these predictors, we developed nomograms to calculate individualised risk of neonatal care unit admission. Bootstrapping indicated good internal performance and external validation suggested good reproducibility.DiscussionOur nomograms allow the user to quickly estimate individualised risk of neonatal care unit admission. Future research should aim to improve accuracy in early pregnancy to better assist counselling of parents.
PurposeMaxillofacial reconstruction with dental implants in microvascular tissue flaps aims to improve mastication. However, the quality of life (QoL) impact of this intervention is yet to be determined. This systematic review assessed the QoL impact of maxillofacial reconstruction with implant-supported teeth compared to no dental rehabilitation, removable dentures, and obturator (modified denture). Additionally, we examined instruments applied to measure QoL in maxillofacial reconstruction.MethodsDatabases Ovid Medline and Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Handle on QoL were searched. Cohort, case–control and randomized controlled trials (RCT) were narratively synthesized for QoL captured through validated instruments. Study methodological quality was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized studies of Exposure. Instruments underwent COSMIN content validity analysis.ResultsOf a total of 2735 studies screened, the three included studies (two cohort and one RCT) showed improved QoL with maxillofacial reconstruction compared to obturator and no dental rehabilitation. However, these studies have high risk of bias due to confounding. None of the instruments achieved a sufficient relevance rating for maxillofacial reconstruction, having been designed for other target populations and there is no evidence on their content validity for this population, but the EORTC QLQ30 H&N35 satisfied more COSMIN criteria than the UW-QOL and OHIP-14.ConclusionAlthough studies showed favourable QoL with maxillofacial reconstruction involving dental implants, these have high risk of bias and further studies are needed to establish the impact. Existing QoL instruments lack content validity and tailored instruments are needed for QoL evaluation in maxillofacial reconstruction.
Although Systemic Family Therapy (SFT) is an evidence-based approach for adolescent behavior problems, manualized SFT models have not been widely adopted in usual care due to the training and implementation resources required. This article presents a core competencies framework for offering SFT to adolescents and their families. It begins by discussing challenges to implementing SFT in routine care and presents the core elements strategy. It then describes the rationale and procedures for developing competency guidelines for SFT. It then describes a paradigm shift that undergirds SFT and articulates two categories of competencies: Systemic Stance and Systemic Skills. The Systemic Stance competencies described are Collaborative and Empowering, Nonjudgmental Curiosity, Respect for Complexity, Maintain a Relational Focus, Focus on Process, Conscious of Similarities and Differences, and Critical Consciousness. The Systemic Skills competencies described are Systemic Assessment, Construct a Relational Cycle, Problem Formulation, Broaden the Map, Goal Formulation, Maintain Balance among Family Members, and Putting Forth and Drawing Forth. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for implementation, practice, and future research.
High levels of parenting stress, defined as a caregiver or parent feeling stress or aggravation from parenting, has been previously shown to be associated with an increased likelihood of neglect, child maltreatment, and household dysfunction: adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Despite the potential mitigation of positive childhood experiences (PCEs) on ACEs, prior studies on the increased likelihood of a child experiencing ACEs due to parenting stress have left a critical question unanswered: whether high parenting stress may decrease a child’s likelihood of experiencing PCEs. We analyzed the 2019–2020 National Survey of Children’s Health to examine whether higher levels of parenting stress are associated with the lower likelihood of experiencing PCEs among children. Children with caregivers experiencing high parenting stress had a lower odds of experiencing many types of PCEs, including after school activities (aOR 0.48; 95% CI 0.38–0.57), community volunteer (aOR 0.63; 95% CI 0.52–0.77), and guiding mentor (aOR 0.65; 95% CI 0.50–0.85). Lowering parenting stress through economic supports and parenting programs/interventions could increase the likelihood that a child experiences PCEs.
This qualitative study aimed to capture community perspectives of the risks and protective factors for social emotional development and mental health of young children in low-income South Africa settings, and was conducted as one component of a larger study with the ultimate aim of co-designing theMazi Umntanakho(‘know your child’) digital tool. Twenty focus group discussions (n = 154, 97% female) were held with staff of community-based organisations (CBOs) and community health worker (CHW) programmes in urban and rural sites from four geographical regions. Data were analysed thematically, and grouped according to components of nurturing care (responsive caregiving, safety and security, good health, adequate nutrition, opportunities for early learning) and risk and protective factors. Risks reported by participants far outweighed protective factors, and the most dominant theme identified was risks associated with responsive caregiving from CBO and CHW perspectives. These related to participants’ perceptions of caregivers’ attitudes, knowledge, beliefs, behaviours, and challenges not conducive to the provision of responsive caregiving. The most commonly perceived risks to safety and security were substance abuse, along with economic challenges, neglect, abuse and violence. Basic needs not being met was reported as the main risk to adequate nutrition and good health, followed by insufficient services. Limited resources and caregivers’ limited education and literacy were perceived to be risks to early learning. These findings highlight the urgent need to mitigate risks and amplify protective factors for the social emotional development and mental health of young children in South Africa. It is critical that these are considered within the contextual realities of low-income communities.
Differentiated instruction (DI) is a teaching philosophy which addresses the learning needs of individual children. This multiple case study aimed to investigate the extent preschool teachers differentiated content, process, assessment, and learning environment within multicultural classrooms. Four early childhood teachers’ experiences were examined through observations, interviews, photographs, and field notes. It was found teachers used multiple strategies to differentiate their instructional process and content. Strategies of demonstration, providing physical support, peer observation, or repeating directions were prominent for concrete learning. Also, it was determined that teachers implemented several strategies such as using visual materials and activities, and/or diversifying the types of activities for similar topics to differentiate educational content in multicultural classrooms. Moreover, teachers used a limited number of strategies including managing time and resources flexibly as a means of differentiating the learning environment. Similarly, they rarely reported, nor were observed to differentiate assessment. Thus, teachers’ differentiated practices, especially those based on learning environment and assessment, should be developed with effective educational policies. Overall, the value of this study is undeniable in terms of providing a perspective to be able to handle these challenges of educators in implementing culturally responsive education in different countries.
There is evidence of an overall decline in women’s mental health, particularly those with young children, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, research has also found heterogeneity in women’s mental health responses. This longitudinal study sampled low-income women with young children by recruiting from the government’s child care financial subsidy waitlist. To examine heterogeneity in women’s mental health responses to COVID-19, a latent transition analysis was employed to identify profiles of anxiety, depression, and stress among 289 low-income mothers. Using these identified profiles, we examined the transitional patterns between profiles before and during COVID-19 and the sociodemographic and familial factors related to these profiles. A three-profile solution was identified prior to COVID-19 and a four-profile solution during COVID-19, with some profiles exhibiting qualitatively different defining characteristics. Latent transition analyses found diverse patterns of mental health changes after the onset of COVID-19. Mothers with better mental health prior to COVID-19 tended to have the most stable mental health during COVID-19. In contrast, mothers who were highly stressed prior to COVID-19 were equally likely to improve or decline after the onset of the pandemic. In addition, the relationships between race, parenting practices, child temperament, and child mental health were significantly related to mothers’ mental health profiles. These findings describe mothers’ experiences and areas where policymakers and practitioners can tailor support to low-income women with young children.
PurposeHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Patients are often diagnosed with advanced disease, in which systemic and locoregional therapies are commonly used as first-line treatment. Such treatments can cause adverse events (AEs) that negatively affect quality of life (QoL), which is particularly undesirable where prognosis is poor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of common AEs on QoL in patients with HCC.MethodsData from the SARAH randomized controlled trial (RCT) were analyzed. Given the large number of distinct AEs that occurred in the trial, AEs were grouped as in the SARAH trial and prioritized using principal component analysis (PCA). Linear mixed-effects models were then applied with age, ECOG status, and AEs as predictors of the QoL change as measured with the EORTC Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30).ResultsThe PCA resulted in the selection of 28 AEs for inclusion in the linear mixed-effects models. Of the 28 AEs, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (hand-foot syndrome) were significant drivers of reductions in QoL as measured using the QLQ-C30 global health status scale. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hand-foot syndrome were also significant drivers of reduced QoL outcomes.ConclusionThe present analysis showed that diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were significantly associated with reduced QoL in patients with unresectable HCC. Reducing the incidence and/or severity of these AEs should therefore be a key focus when selecting the optimal treatments for these patients.
Trans subjectivities continue to be included in major compendia of mental illness, despite recent moves to depathologize “cross-gender identification.” Regardless, the inclusion of “gender dysphoria” is often framed as a formal mechanism to support access to gender affirming care as transgender subjectivities are re-conceptualized as part of sex/gender diversity and away from madness. The latter permits trans individuals to evade sanist oppressions. However, moves to disassociate from mad individuals also often serve to condone sanism. For instance, a contemporary policy landscape often sees transgender advocates arguing for the “medical necessity” of gender affirming care for gender dysphoria as a “recognized medical condition,” thereby skirting the inclusion of gender dysphoria as apsychiatriccondition and implying that gender dysphoria carries a special ontological status that separates it from madness (reified as “mental illness”). More though, this framework endorses material violences toward mad individuals that are often advanced via the workings of the state to consign marginalized constituents to death by withholding the means of life, i.e., necropolitics. In the following, I argue that trans disassociations from madness often endorses or assents to mad necropolitics. Drawing from Mbembe’s (Necropolitics. Duke University Press, Durham, 2019) framework, I suggest that medicalizing trans narratives, despite being used to object to anti-trans laws in contemporary context, ideologically support mad “death worlds” organized through the U.S.A. welfare state and prison industrial complex. However, I also suggest alternative strategies, i.e., intersectional collaboration, that may uplift mad and/or trans communities.
The Norwegian/Danish word «samskaping” is today one of the most frequently used terms or concepts in the public discourse of development and change. Scholars familiar with the work of Morten Levin and Max Elden will recognize “samskaping” as a short translation of their model of “cogenerative learning”, originating from the discussion in the 80’s and 90’ on participative action research processes. However, there is no simple line of transfer of ideas from “cogenerative learning” in action research to “samskaping” in public sector today. Rather, three concepts from different disciplines all ended up being translated into or strongly associated with the newly constructed and popular Norwegian word “samskaping”, and Morten Levin’s “cogenerative learning” is one of the three. The two others are co-production and co-creation, which originates from fields of innovation research in private and public sector. Seen from the position of action research and the heritage from Morten Levin, this means that although his (and Max Eldens) concept (in the Norwegian translation) appears to have gained a strong impact Norway the last decade, the meaning and importance of the concept is partially lost to many of its later users. This article will track the main roots of “samskaping” as it has found its way in the everyday language of change and development in Norway, and will in particular try to reclaim for the term or concept, some of the main themes that shaped the discussion and the design of the co-generative learning model in PAR, in particular participation, power and social change.
Climate change can contribute to the increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) diseases, the leading cause of global deaths. Accordingly, many big cities are interested in increasing their residents’ resilience against heat waves. With these issues in mind, the aim of our study was to identify salient features of urban areas and to analyze the effect of such features on population vulnerability to heat (VtoH) as it relates to CV health. This approach was developed and tested in the city of Milan, Italy, considering the summer periods (May–September) of 2017–2022. Milan was divided into 86 districts and 11 features were considered. K-means was applied for clustering, and both spatial and non-spatial regression were used to study the VtoH, defined as the percentage of CV emergencies on a given heat day and on the day after, compared to the total number of CV emergencies. Socio-urban features were spatially non-stationary and three different clusters of districts were identified. In the whole city, regression analysis depicted a spatial relationship between the focal features and the VtoH, with the model estimating a significant effect in five variables: mean summer temperature, density of drinking water fountains and percentages of elderly, female and graduate residents. Three additional features were found to be significant in only some of the cities’ clusters. Our spatial analysis of CV health emergencies applied to the entire geographical area, rather than at the patient level, represents a relatively underexplored approach in public health-related research. The results of our study and future research taking this approach can inform solutions to equitably protect cities’ residents, which is important in the context of ongoing urbanization and climate change.
This paper addresses the heterogeneity of the digital divide and internet use among citizens in the 28 European Union (EU) countries (at the time of the survey). Drawing from the Eurobarometer Surveys, three indicators of the digital divide are used to define the groups: frequency of internet access, means of internet access, and online activities. The categorical clustering algorithm identifies six groups of internet users:Non-Users,Basic Users, Information Exchangers,Instrumental Users, Socializers,andAdvanced Users, each with distinct socio-demographic profiles. The study reveals significant socio-economic and demographic profiling variables characterizing these patterns, including age, education, gender, occupation, type of community and geographic location. A major digital divide is detected in many countries; Notably, Romania, Greece, and Bulgaria have the largest proportion ofNon-Users, emphasizing the need for targeted policy interventions. These results provide crucial insights for the European Commission’s digitization strategy, suggesting that more nuanced and targeted measures are needed to ensure equitable digital access across the EU.
This study examines the relationship between neighborhood adversity, educational opportunities, and externalizing problems in early adolescents using baseline data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Participants were aged 9 to 10 years (M = 9 years, 11 months), with 52.7 percent male; 60.58 percent racialized as White (N= 5577), 16.21% as Black (N= 1492), and 23.21% as Hispanic/Latinx (N= 2137). Descriptive statistics provided mean-level differences in exposure to neighborhood adversity and access to educational opportunities among the different groups. Regression models assessed the main and interactive effects of adversity and educational opportunities on externalizing problems, controlling for material hardship, parent education, sex, and age. Neighborhood disadvantage contributed to externalizing problems across groups, and there was some evidence that educational opportunities buffered the impact of adversity for all groups, but the interactions differed in their strengths based on other considerations. These findings suggest that educational opportunities and adversity interact differently across racialized groups, highlighting the need for policies that account for these nuanced experiences.
Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBC) and high-risk individuals are advised to discuss participation with their doctor and not to participate in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Yet a substantial proportion still participate in the Danish faecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening and have a higher positive FIT rate than the average-risk population. We estimated the risk of false-positive screening among individuals with inflammatory bowel disease and high-risk individuals to improve recommendations regarding screening participation. We included 71,871 FIT-positive participants (2014–2017) who had a subsequent colonoscopy within 3 months. Screening outcome within 180 days was established by using registers. We determined that 26,591 of the included participants had a false-positive screening. Participants with IBC or high CRC risk had a significantly higher risk of getting a false-positive screening than the average risk population, resulting in too many screening-related colonoscopies being performed among these individuals, indicating a need to update the screening protocols.
The nature of the relationship between adolescents’ use of smartphones and their well-being over a longer period is still an open question. By using data collected from 284 Croatian adolescents (10 to 15 years old; mean age in 2021 = 12.23; 40.2% boys) in a 4-wave longitudinal study (2021–2023), the paper wanted to fill the gap and explore longitudinal associations among problematic smartphone use (PSU), internalizing problems (IP) and adolescents’ well-being (WB). Adolescents completed the Smartphone Addiction Scale (Kwon et al.,PloS One,8(2), e56936. 2013a) at wave 1 and 4, the Social Skills Improvement System Rating Scales (SSIS; Gresham & Elliott,Social skills improvement system: Rating scales. Bloomington, MN: Pearson Assessments. 2008) at wave 3 and 4, the PANAS scale (Mackinnon et al.Personality and Individual Differences, 27, 405–416. 1999), and the Brief Multidimensional Students’ Life Satisfaction Scale (BMSLSS; Seligson et al.Social Indicators Research, 61, 121–145. 2003) at wave1 and 4. The results showed a small direct longitudinal association of PSU and negative affect (NA). A small indirect association of PSU with NA and life satisfaction (LS) was found via IP. Namely, higher PSU was related to more NA and lower LS, through its association with more IP. The results showed bidirectional association of PSU and IP. The findings imply that over a longer time interval, PSU can negatively affect adolescent WB, and that screening procedures should be developed for discovering vulnerable children in early adolescence.
In this paper, we propose a new method for dynamic discrete choice logit models with panel data, which capture both unobserved individual heterogeneities and the state dependence on purchase behaviors. The consistency and asymptotic normality of this estimators are studied in detail. Comparing with the estimators developed by Honore and Kyriazidou (Econometrica 68:839–874, 2000), the pseudo conditional likelihood estimators proposed by Bartolucci and Nigro (J Econom 170:102–116, 2012) and the modified profile likelihood estimators given by Bartolucci et al. (Economet Rev 35:1271–1289, 2016), simulations show the proposed estimators have some advantages on the mean bias and root mean squared error. As a byproduct, another estimator for static logit models is given and comparable with that developed by Chamberlain (in: Griliches Z, Intrilligator MD (eds), Handbook of econometrics, vol 2. North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1984). Last, the proposed approach is applied to the panel data on household detergent purchases and concludes that there exists significant dynamic relationship on household detergent purchases.
PurposePatient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly used in oncology care, but pharmacists providing direct patient care have been overlooked. We engaged pharmacists and adults receiving oral oncolytics (chemotherapy medication taken by mouth) to develop a SmartForm© in the electronic health record (EHR) for PROM monitoring. Pharmacists verbally ask the patient side effect questions during routine telehealth encounters and enter responses in real time.MethodsOur development process was guided by the Knowledge to Action Framework. In phase 1 (Knowledge Inquiry), we prioritized side effects to assess in the EHR SmartForm© via interviews with patients and a Delphi panel with pharmacists. Adults receiving oral oncolytics for breast (n = 12), thoracic (n = 12), or hematological (n = 12) cancer were interviewed, with purposeful sampling for adults who were aged 65 + years or Black. Interviews were coded with content analysis. We conducted three Delphi rounds, with 11/19, 13/19, and 19/19 pharmacists, respectively. In phase 2 (Knowledge Synthesis), PROM items were selected and the EHR SmartForm© programmed. In phase 3 (Knowledge Tailoring), we conducted usability testing with pharmacists.ResultsPharmacists and patients were consistent in prioritizing side effects of oral oncolytics and 10 were retained. Patients advocated asking whether they can do their usual activities, while pharmacists added medication adherence. Usability testing yielded suggestions to simplify the SmartForm©.ConclusionBy presenting screenshots of our SmartForm©, our findings are useful to other healthcare systems looking for a PROM solution integrated in the EHR, with a reasonable pharmacist/clinician workload, and no requirement for patients to have internet access/comfort.
Implementation gaps in the areas of naturalization and immigrant regularization emerge through a mismatch between the documents a residence country requires, and the documents that refugees and migrants can realistically provide. Those caught in this gap may live undocumented or risk statelessness. Residence countries can close such paperwork gaps by adapting legal interpretations and easing administrative requirements. When Colombia faced large-scale international displacement from Venezuela, state actors identified documentation-based implementation gaps in its nationality law and regularization procedures; they then took an innovative – yet not faultless – approach by adapting its citizenship and immigration regimes to accommodate displaced Venezuelans. These changes strengthened access to essential rights and increased the well-being of many. In this article, we develop the concepts ofpaperwork gapsandpaper bridgesand discuss the actors, impact, and limitations of Colombia’s policy innovations in the areas of nationality by birth, naturalization, and regularization based on research conducted from 2020 to 2023. The study advances the literature on government learning regarding policies within citizenship and immigration regimes that target internationally displaced populations.
Fear and threats during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have caused stigma, but COVID-19-related stigma among children has not been well studied. We examined children’s COVID-19-related stigma among children and related factors to mitigate stigmatizing perceptions. We utilized a dataset of 1500 households from a nationwide postal survey of randomly selected children in fifth and eighth grade in Japan in December 2020. Children responded to the frequency of their caregivers’ and teachers’ communicative support (i.e., asking or accepting one’s thoughts) and three types of stigmas (self-stigma, stereotype and discrimination as public stigma) toward COVID-19. A total of 772 dyads of children and caregivers responded to the survey, and the analytic sample consisted of 768 dyads (51.2% of the target sample) after excluding missing data for the stigma variable. A multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear analysis was performed to examine the association between child stigma and communicative support from caregivers and teachers, adjusting for sampling weights. Self-stigma was the most common type of stigma among children. Both communicative support from caregivers and teachers were significantly associated with lower perceptions of discrimination. Higher support from teachers was associated with lower self-stigma among children in eighth grade and lower stereotypes among children in fifth grade. This study highlights the presence of self-stigma related to COVID-19 in middle childhood and adolescence. Communicative support from caregivers and teachers is essential to listen to children’s beliefs about COVID-19, to provide emotional safety, and to mitigate stigma during difficult times.
This article identifies the dynamics of the refugee rights movements that have emerged in the wake of the 2015 “summer of welcome.” Building upon “New Social Movements” research and fieldwork in Berlin, the research traces these movements’ motivations/aims, social composition/profile, mobilization strategies/repertories of action, and social location. In line with critical urban studies, the article also reflects on how specific urban space and existing political dynamics inform and structure refugee rights movements. Finally, this research seeks to provide insights into our understanding of the New Social Movements in general and refugee rights movements in particular.
We explore whether expectations, quantified by GDP changes, explain period fertility patterns observed in post-recession spells. Negative expectations emerge with economic recessions and prevail quickly. They fade away slowly as the economy rebounds. That slow reduction in negative expectations may warrant the continuation of the fertility decline during the recovery years. Differences in fertility between countries may be attributed to the severity of the recession (negative expectations) and the subsequent rates of economic growth (positive expectations). Through a cross-country analysis in 35 OECD countries and a regional analysis across 25 European countries, we found that the higher the increase in GDP per capita between 2010 and 2019, the less the decline in period fertility rates.
An enduring theory of the jury is that the institution is a tool the people can use against elites. The jury can be a sword, to give elites their just desserts. Or it can be a shield, to protect defendants against elite judges and prosecutors. Another possibility is that elites can use the jury to attack each other. As certain trials in ancient Athens and the trial of Donald Trump suggest, the jury can be weaponized in inter-elite warfare. Juries are especially useful in such battles, as they can help to cloak the power of judges, prosecutors, and other elites in instigating and driving the case. Montesquieu pointed to the ability of juries to cloak the power of elite judges, although he hoped judges would use their power to promote liberty. The legal system in the United States is particularly suited for the weaponization of juries; that of England and Wales, less so. An even better system may be the mixed panel of professional judges and lay jurors sitting together, in effect a microcosm of the Aristotelian mixed regime.
This paper contributes to the development of a problem-structuring method for exploring sustainability opportunities in systems. It presents a case of designing the plane while flying it, using an action research methodology to develop the Sustainability Opportunity Study over a period of 2 years. The problem-structuring method was applied and developed in the context of a research and development network for improving sustainability of housing in East Africa through alternative binders in block-based building. The resulting method consists of the three main stages Diagnosing, Analysing, Solving, where activities are informed by critical systems thinking and insights derived from experience and reflections from the case. The method uses different types of workshops to derive specific project proposals for further implementation and realisation of the identified sustainability opportunities. Results also suggest four types of evaluation of the Sustainability Opportunity Study based on the main focus of the intervention: Focus on effectiveness (number of relevant project proposals), focus on creating shared understanding (perceived learning among participants), focus on ensuring fairness (level of engagement among marginalized stakeholders), or focus on commitment to Critical Systems Thinking (breadth and depth in Diagnosing, Analysing and Solving).
While the history of urban sociology features myriad detailed descriptions of neighborhood life reflecting various theoretical, political, and practical purposes, the field lacks general templates for conducting in-depth neighborhood research and comparison. In this paper, as a remedy, we propose a Goffmanian framework for qualitative neighborhood description and analysis which we call "neighborhood as theater." While revisiting previous ethnographic research of two neighborhoods in Hollywood, Los Angeles, conducted in the late 1990s, we argue that local social life operates along three main dramaturgical axes—sets, characters, and performances—each divided into several subcategories. These three focal points reveal observable, yet easily overlooked, key elements of neighborhood life besides illuminating broader, structural aspects and connections. We argue that conceptualizing neighborhoods “as theater" offers a general template for ethnographic urban research that can advance comparative and critical spatial analysis while remaining grounded in meaning-centered, embodied experiences of mundane local life.
In this paper we take inspiration from Levin’s (2003) provocation “can universities ever become a greenhouse for education in action research?” His assertion that creating action research learning opportunities within universities is possible becomes particularly relevant in the context of a changing Higher Degree Research (HDR) landscape, notably in Australia. The increasing emphasis on industry-focused doctorates and the demand for post-doctoral career pathways beyond academia necessitates a deeper understanding of supporting engaged and impact-oriented research training. To address these challenges, we present a reflexive discussion centred around the HDR Participatory Action Research (PAR) Collaborative—a year-long peer-learning initiative designed to cultivate a community of practice on transdisciplinary participatory research among graduate researchers at the University of Technology Sydney. This was conducted as a participatory action research project, with a systems-thinking orientation. We articulate lessons learned around the blockers and enablers for training HDR candidates engaged in participatory research to tackle wicked problems and ways to enhance HDR researcher development in this area, including the prototyping of new peer learning and mentoring approaches. By aligning with Levin’s emphasis on practical and useful knowledge, we highlight the importance of curriculum design for synchronous and asynchronous hybrid delivery, collective peer learning practices, and transdisciplinary orientations to research as crucial factors for success in action research programs within the academic context. By addressing the evolving needs of HDR training and research cultures, our study contributes to the ongoing dialogue on holistic and integrative research approaches and ways to support them within higher education.
In 2020-21 the Victorian state government in Australia imposed 262 days of sustained lockdown on Melbourne’s population in a bid to contain the COVID pandemic. These lockdowns, among the longest in the world, affected young people especially. Children were subjected to months of curfews, home schooling using digital platforms and severe travel. Nonetheless some children engaged repeatedly in autonomous and well co-ordinated efforts to construct dirt jumps and ride their bikes in urban public parklands in eastern Melbourne. This article is mindful of a long tradition of scholarly work tracing the ways young people have used public space, and contested ‘adultist’ representations of them and regulations affecting the use of public space. We address three questions: Why and how did children design, construct and use dirt bike jumps during the COVID pandemic in public parklands? How did Victorian local councils and others like police, older residents and mainstream media respond to children’s construction of DIY dirt jumps? How were these spontaneous DIY dirt jumps understood by Victorian local councils? Adopting a composite case study method and employing a relational perspective, we draw on images, participant observation, field notes, documents and webpage analysis to answer the research questions. We document how children used urban parklands to hang out, to onstruct and use bike jumps during the lockdowns. We show how they challenged adult representations of themselves and public space which depicted their bike riding and the jump making as anti-social and illegal. Meanwhile local governments continued through the COVID-19 pandemic to proclaim the value of ‘youth participation.’ When that youth participation involved young people initiating and managing projects themselves, their conduct was deemed unlawful as councils continued denying them any meaningful opportunities to exercise autonomy, or have say in important policy decisions. In the final section of the article say why providing insider accounts of what happens is useful for good policy-making and professional practice.
ObjectiveTo assess effects of Healthy Change intervention on maternal perception of her child’s body weight (MPCW), maternal feeding style, and obesogenic home environment.MethodsA randomized control trial was conducted, consisting of two arms: the intervention group received the Healthy Change program, and the control group received the Hygiene and Accident Prevention program. A total of 356 mother-preschool child dyads participated, 182 in the intervention group and 174 in the control group, residing in Mexico and the United States. Data were collected at baseline and after the program through self-administered questionnaires completed by mothers and child anthropometric measurements.ResultsAlthough no significant between-group difference in pre- and post-intervention change of MPCW was found, sub-analyses revealed that a higher proportion of mothers in the intervention group accurately perceived their child’s body weight at the study endpoint using categorical (67% vs. 57.1%,p< 0.005) and visual scales (48.9% vs. 41.8%,p< 0.015). Additionally, more mothers of overweight children in the intervention group accurately perceived their children’s overweight and obese status compared to those in the control group (29.8% vs. 10.3%,X2= 4.26,df= 1,p< 0.039). The intervention group also displayed a higher proportion of mothers with authoritative feeding style (26.4% vs. 16.5%,p< 0.036) and significantly higher family nutrition and physical activity scores (29.1 vs. 28.0,p< 0.000) at the study endpoint.Conclusions for practiceHealthy Change Intervention led to improved accuracy of MPCW, a shift toward maternal authoritative feeding styles, and positive changes in obesogenic home environments.
This paper provides an analytical framework for the study of spatial income dynamics using the classical measures of\(\sigma\)-convergence (reduction in dispersion) and\(\beta\)-convergence (poor areas grow more quickly than rich ones) linked by a re-ranking metric and reinterpreted based on the ‘leave no one behind’ principle. Our approach allows identifying the contribution of each territorial unit to each of the three facets of distributional change (\(\sigma\)-convergence,\(\beta\)-convergence, and re-ranking), as well as gauging the part of each component of distributional change that corresponds to geographically neighbouring and non-neighbouring units. We illustrate our proposal by examining convergence across the census tracts of Malaga – the sixth most populated city of Spain – before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that while income convergence across Malaga’s census tracts tended to improve over the period 2015–2019, this process was interrupted during the first year of the pandemic, affecting some specific census tracts. We examine our outcomes by grouping the results into deciles and districts made up of specific census tracts. Finally, we analyse the impact of neighbours on regional convergence and each of its components. This spatial decomposition highlights the crucial role of the spatial component in the convergence process.
The ageing population and increasing life expectancy in Italy, and in other developed countries, leads to an increasing number of elderly people suffering from loss of autonomy and dangers due to frailty. As a consequence, elderly patients usually suffer from chronic diseases which require long term care, with increasing healthcare needs and costs. Therefore, services provided by home care, day centers and residential services are necessary; their primary objective being to maximize patient well-being and satisfaction. Patient satisfaction is a key indicator of the quality of care and is an important outcome of care in its own right. This study aimed to develop two generic instruments to elicit patients’ satisfaction in residential care and in home care with a rigorous and systematic methodology. The two instruments were tested for psychometric performance with face-to-face interviews and applied to a Local Health District of the Marche Region. Furthermore, due to physical and mentally frailty, many elderly patients in residential homes or receiving home care, are unable to participate in studies on satisfaction with care services, while their carers/partners can often provide relevant information. Therefore, another aim of this study was to measure patients’ and carers’/partners’ agreement on patient satisfaction in the two services investigated. Finally, the principal factors influencing patient satisfaction in the two services investigated were investigated using logistic regression analysis.
A growing number of early childhood education (ECE) programs are using trauma-informed trainings to support teachers in better managing children’s trauma-related challenging behaviors. However, there is not a great deal of research on how effective these programs are for improving children’s school-related outcomes. This study examines whether a 6-hour trauma-informed training provided to preschool teachers was related to children’s child expulsion risk, teacher perception of child behavior, and student-teacher relationships. Seventy-four teachers from 7 elementary schools in the Mountain West region received a six-hour trauma-informed training over three months. Children’s school-related outcomes were collected through teacher report in pre- and post-training surveys. Linear growth modeling was used to estimate change in children’s outcomes over time, adjusting for child gender and student-teacher racial/ethnic match. There were significant decreases in child disruption, a subscale of expulsion risk, and improvements in student-teacher closeness following training; no other child outcomes changed significantly. More evidence-based research is needed to support or refute whether trauma-informed training is effective and promotes positive child outcomes.
PurposeMeaningful score differences (MSDs), as defined by recent FDA guidance, can improve the interpretation of outcome measure scores and score changes. Well-accepted methods for estimating MSDs typically rely on external anchor variables, but the applications of these methods are limited in children and adolescents with rheumatic diseases. This project explored multiple candidate anchors for the PROMIS®Pediatric measures of Physical Activity, Fatigue, Pain Interference, and Mobility for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).MethodsLongitudinal data were extracted from the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Registry. Candidate anchors included patient-reported domain-specific global impressions of change (GIC) along with other parent- and clinician-reported variables. Prior to MSD estimation, the quality of the anchors was assessed using a priori criteria (correlation ≥0.30, n≥10, <10% missing). Anchors meeting criteria were used to calculate MSDs.ResultsAmong 289 children with JIA and 47 with SLE, the GIC did not meet criteria inhalf of the scenarios. Other candidate anchors performed slightly better. The calculated MSDs varied by external anchor across measures, diagnoses, and direction of change (better vs worse).ConclusionsMany of the candidate external anchoring variables did not meet pre-specified criteria for calculating MSDs. Even for those that did, the choice of anchoring variable had a strong impact on the estimated MSD value and were different from other published values. As in adults, establishing pediatric MSDs requires selection of high-quality anchors, as changes in the variables used as anchors can impact MSD values and any subsequent score interpretations.
PurposeDespite advancements in antiretroviral therapy (ART) that extend life expectancy, older adults with HIV (OAHIV) face elevated cardiovascular disease risks. This study examines the impact of arterial stiffness on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among OAHIV in rural Northern Thailand.MethodsWe conducted a 5-year prospective cohort study from 2015, including 338 OAHIV aged ≥ 50 without prior cardiovascular disease who received ART in 12 community hospitals in Chiang Mai. Arterial stiffness was assessed using Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI), with values ≥ 8 indicating significant stiffness. HRQoL was measured using the MOS-HIV Health Survey at baseline, one year, and five years. Analysis adjusted for HIV/AIDS severity, cardiovascular comorbidities, and socioeconomic factors.ResultsElevated CAVI (≥ 8) was associated with lower HRQoL scores. The elevated CAVI group showed lower physical health summary scores (average difference:− 2.2 points, 95%CI: − 3.5 to − 0.9) and mental health summary scores (average difference: − 1.2 points, 95%CI: − 2.2 to − 0.3) compared to the normal CAVI group (CAVI < 8).ConclusionFindings highlight the importance of routine screening for arterial stiffness and support the implementation of comprehensive care strategies that incorporate cardiovascular risk management. Such approaches could guide public health interventions and clinical practices to enhance the overall health and well-being of OAHIV, potentially through targeted cardiovascular risk reduction programs and personalized care plans. However, the study’s regional focus in rural Northern Thailand and participant attrition over the five-year period limit the generalizability of the findings. Future research in diverse settings with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm these results.
The article explores the Filipino concept ofDalamhatias an expression of the praxis of love within environmental activism.Dalamhatiemphasizes a mutual relationship with the natural world, rejects the idea of human dominance, recognizes negative emotions, and addresses feelings of despair and hopelessness that beset environmental activists dealing with unrelenting ecological loss due to climate change.Dalamhati,in Filipino, describes profound grief and sorrow, including sadness, anguish, and lamentation. It is from two Malay-based words:hati, meaning “liver,” traditionally considered the seat of emotions for many Philippine ethnolinguistic groups, anddalam, meaning “deep or within.” Poetically,Dalamhatirefers to a liver-splitting or heart-rending emotion.Dalamhati, with its attributes ofpighati(lamentation or sorrow),lunggati(yearning or earnest desire),andluwalhati(joyful exuberance), serves as a foundation for developing more effective and action-oriented care ethics in environmental activism. This article draws on reflections on the real-life experiences of three Catholic priests who are environmental advocates in the Southern Philippines.
Social safety is a crucial metric for assessing social stability and progress. Since the housing system reform in 1998, housing prices in Chinese cities have surged for over two decades. Excessively high housing prices have garnered scholarly attention regarding their impact on social safety. However, most existing research explores this impact through a linear perspective. To more comprehensively identify the impact of housing prices on individuals' perceptions of social safety and provide valuable references for formulating scientific and reasonable housing and social policies, this study employs the China Family Panel Studies data and an ordered probit model. Based on the cognition-affective system theory, we empirically examine the impact of housing price increases on individuals' perceptions of social safety and its mechanisms. The findings indicate that rising housing prices initially enhance individuals' perceptions of social safety, but beyond a certain threshold, they diminish this perception, forming an inverted U-shaped relationship. Heterogeneity analysis reveals varying responses among different groups: The older generation and locals exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship in their perceptions of social safety in response to rising housing prices, while the younger generation and nonlocals do not. Additionally, differences in housing ownership, region, gender, and household income contribute to varying perceptions of social safety. Further analysis suggests that improvements in public services and the living environment can enhance individuals' perceptions of social safety. Conversely, high housing prices heighten competition for housing and undermine confidence in future stability, thereby negatively impacting the perception of social safety.
PurposeThe relationship between quality of life (QoL) and frailty has previously been investigated cross-sectionally and longitudinally as unidirectional where QoL depends upon frailty and where frailty depends on QoL. Here a bidirectional relationship is examined.MethodsThis work uses a latent curve model with structured residuals to address the bidirectional association between QoL and frailty in older English people considering within-person and group levels. The study measures frailty using a functional frailty measure and quality of life using CASP-12. The sample size is 17,529.ResultsThere is a strong relationship between QoL (Quality of Life) and frailty, which is almost linear and inversely proportional over time. Although the cross-lagged coefficients from QoL to frailty and vice versa showed statistical significance, the impact was found to be minimal. The time between assessments (which are two years apart) and/or the few observations available per individual may have impacted the effect of this relationship. When accounting for gender, age, net wealth, and multimorbidity, some variations in the results were observed at the group level but not at the within-person level.ConclusionThe study provides empirical evidence that supports a bidirectional association between QoL and frailty in older individuals who reside at home. These results offer valuable insights for healthcare providers, as participants did not exhibit an advanced need for health services. Additionally, involving participants in evaluating and assessing these services enhances their effectiveness and overall benefit.
Using the administrative records of the Spanish Public Employment Service for the period 2018–2019, we analysed the impact of participation in job search assistance and training programmes on the chances of unemployed jobseekers finding employment, as well as the quality of the job obtained. Propensity score matching techniques were used to evaluate the effectiveness of these programmes. We found that participation exerted a positive and significant differential effect on the probability of transition from unemployment to employment and on the probability of finding a job of intermediate quality compared to non-participation. This positive impact was largely due to the effect of training programmes, the magnitude of which persisted even as the period elapsed between participation and exit towards employment increased, whereas job search assistance was less effective over time. The positive influence of participation appeared to be more intense for specific socioeconomic groups.
PurposeThe purpose of this study was to use qualitative interviews to understand the experiences of adult women with sickle cell disease (SCD) through daily life and navigating the healthcare system.MethodsWe conducted semi-structured interviews with reproductive-aged women with SCD and performed thematic analysis.ResultsWe analyzed interviews from 20 participants. Our data demonstrated three overarching themes: perceptions of disease, transitions of care, and stigma and bias. Participants identified feelings of both empowerment and powerlessness from SCD that evolved over time and globally impacted their lives. The transition from pediatric to adult care was a vulnerable period, both surrounding changes in disease character and challenges transitioning healthcare systems. Finally, participants faced discrimination and prejudice within SCD care, which manifested as disvaluing of their own disease expertise or perpetuation of a “drug-seeking” stereotype. In the context of this bias, some participants prioritized seeking same-race providers.ConclusionExperiences with SCD contribute significantly to daily quality of life in women with SCD, and ongoing care gaps exist in relation to their disease. Within our population, SCD as a physical and mental stressor requiring interdisciplinary support should not be underestimated. More robust systems to support the transition from pediatric to adult care are also necessary, both on a healthcare institution level and to support patients’ engagement in their care. Finally, provider education and training on anti-racist practice and both recognizing and eliminating bias are essential to improving care of SCD patients. Possible interactions between sex, gender, and race in the experience of SCD warrant further exploration.
Research on cultural production has recognized that artistic creation, especially fandom subcultures, depends on social interaction within artworlds. Yet less research has examined how creative production functions when exogenous social forces disrupt key forms of interaction. This study leverages the case of Chinese fanfiction writers’ response when state censorship interrupts and threatens fanfiction writing to better understand the vulnerability of creative communities. Based on interviews with Chinese fanfiction writers who experienced an unexpected intensification of online censorship in 2020, and following fandom studies in understanding fanfiction as rooted in a gift economy, I show how censorship discouraged writing by destabilizing interaction and interfering with gift exchanges. I find that censorship transformed cultural production by (1) reorganizing and fragmenting networks, (2) reshaping the meaning of visibility, and (3) opening up new opportunities in a disintegrated community. As this study argues, we need to go beyond asking whether censorship is effectively destructive or not. While creative communities are vulnerable to outside disruption, especially in online space, the pressure of censorship leads to new conventions, networks, and fields for artistic creation as censorship does not simply strangle creativity.
Previous studies about intergenerational mobility for the Portuguese economy find that education and income persistence is very high in comparison with other developed economies. We construct relative, absolute, global and local measures of mobility for Portugal, comparing them with existing evidence for this and other countries. These are the intergenerational income elasticity (computed using the two-sample two-stage least squares method), income correlation, rank-rank slope, bottom to top income level probability, the share of individuals earning more than their fathers and also the intergenerational education correlation, the low to high education level probability, and the share of individuals with a higher education level than their fathers. We consider the 1968–1988 cohorts and the 1995 and 2019 waves of the European Community Household Panel and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, respectively. Overall, based on the point estimates, women seem to present more mobility in income. Upward income mobility is verified at the bottom while persistence exists at the top. Women present a greater absolute educational mobility. More than 80% of individuals have a higher education than their fathers and full upward education mobility exists for children of low-educated fathers. Mobility in education is higher for the offspring of medium–high-income fathers. Individuals with a high education level, in the medium–high income level or with occupations requiring a higher education level show higher mobility.
Recently, Europe, including Poland, witnessed several events that encouraged prosocial behaviors toward various actors in social life, including people and organizations. However, are the tendencies to support others changing over the post-COVID-19 yearly period and does that change depend on the target of donations? Based on social support mobilization and deterioration theory and construal level theory, in the current study, we aimed to test the change in the willingness to give money (operationalized as fictitious coins) or time to various targets in need over time. Poles from the general population (N= 566) participated in a 2-wave longitudinal study (first wave conducted in May 2022; second in late April/May 2023). Results showed a drop in the general prosocial giving tendencies of both coins and money over time, which confirms the social support mobilization and deterioration theory. In particular, the willingness to give coins to a Ukrainian refugee and time to Ukrainian and Middle Eastern refugees, as well as a local organization operating for pro-environmental issues and a global organization operating for a better quality of life in the world decreased. Most coins and time were intended to be given to family, a friend, a neighbor, and a Ukrainian refugee, confirming the role of psychological proximity in helping intentions. We provide interpretations of the discovered patterns in the light of previous data. Our analysis may be useful in predicting prosocial giving tendencies, especially for researchers of prosociality, charity organizations, and policymakers.
This essay honors the accomplishments of Morten Levin both by analyzing some of the key innovative educational programs he created and by extending the elements of that analysis to two other cases, that of Aker Solutions and the Mondragon Cooperatives. We acknowledge that the relationship between higher education institutions and manufacturing-service-public sector organizations is multiplex and has undergone multiple transformations over the decades. It is also affected by the national political economy and the scope and diversity of the higher education sector itself. Creating sustained and yet dynamic relations among these actors in service of both higher education and the efficacy and innovativeness of worklife organizations is a significant challenge which all the cases we present have addressed with some success. What the efforts have in common is a democratizing action research built on an ethos and worldview of the benefits of collaboration and co-creation, and organizational capabilities built on Actor Network strategies to promote collaboration and innovation as a way of adapting to the rapidly changing world conditions effectively. We argue that there are many more such examples in existence and that a key role for action research is to document them, show how more collaborative and adaptive organizational processes are possible and show how neoliberal New Public Management is an authoritarian “wrong turn” with dire consequences. Ultimately, this essay is an argument against the “iron cage” view of bureaucracy as always coercive and stultifying and show that it is not bureaucracy but the authoritarian approaches to creating coercive bureaucracies that destroy organizational collaborations and innovation.
Complex posttraumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) encompasses a set of symptoms associated with prolonged or chronic trauma exposure. Because it is a relatively new diagnosis, the healing or recovery process is not yet well understood. Very few studies have examined the unique elements of healing from C-PTSD, and theoretical models surrounding the process are lacking. The current study utilizes grounded theory methodology to investigate how individuals describe their recovery from self-diagnosed C-PTSD. Reddit (a popular social media platform) was used to gather narratives from individuals who identify with the C-PTSD diagnosis. Grounded theory analysis of these data suggested that recovery from self-diagnosed C-PTSD is a long-term recursive process with foundational pieces of initiating recovery and developing emotional regulation skills. In addition, therapy intervention and social support can act as scaffolding for a cyclical inner process that assists those recovering from self-diagnosed C-PTSD as they develop skills and explore emotional, cognitive, and spiritual parts of the self. Through exploration of the inner self, those with self-diagnosed C-PTSD navigate an iterative process of relearning skills and taking accountability to help integrate a positive self-concept and a sense of self-efficacy. These findings provide further insight into the recovery process for those who identify with C-PTSD symptomology. Additionally, implications for treatment and diagnostic considerations are discussed.
Young people in the United States foster care system face unique challenges related to their involvement in the system, often stemming from placement instability, disconnected policy and action, and an overburdened child welfare system. These experiences often result in limited opportunities for self-advocacy and change, difficulties forming quality relationships with peers and important adults, and barriers to academic and independent living success. There is a dire need for theoretically grounded, empirical work that can guide lawmakers, social workers, clinicians, foster/kinship parents, and youth in foster care themselves towards more positive, self-determined experiences within and beyond the system. This review advances Self-Determination Theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, Deci and Ryan, The Journal of Mind and Behavior 1:33–43, 1980) as an under-utilized yet particularly well-suited theoretical framework to guide research that will achieve these aims. After introducing the SDT framework and its clear relevance to critical issues in foster care research, this review articulates an SDT-guided research agenda centered on advancing youths’ well-being, specifically by promoting the achievement of SDT’s three core psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This review also identifies future directions for research applying the SDT framework as a means to better understand and advance the “best interests” of young people in the foster care system.
The widespread adoption of information and communication technologies, along with the digital shift, predominantly relies on the practical application of novel methods that shape the essence of innovation. While literature highlights the swift pace of digitalization, it also encourages us to consider the notion of “disruption” within the framework of sustainability. This paper aims to examine the disruptions in the innovation of processes associated with sustainable development. We present a rigorous (quantitative) analysis of relevant literature spanning from 1995 to 2023, focusing on three research directions: (1) establishing a recursive thematic structure to categorize periods in the literature; (2) identifying defining topics; and (3) determining lexical units that serve as connectors between thematic groups. Through the application of natural language processing and a social network approach, the results reveal consistent topics across years rather than time-specific patterns, with processes and impact evaluation emerging as central junction points.
Despite the considerable growth and advancement in fatherhood research, relatively little is known about the effects of father–child relationship quality on social functioning among children who experience child maltreatment. Applying the strengths-based perspective, the current study sought to examine the association between father–child relationship quality and social functioning (social competence and positive peer relationships) among at-risk children, and to determine whether these associations are moderated by perpetrator type. This study included a sample of 681 US children (age 12 years) drawn from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect. We conducted a series of ordinary least squares multiple regression analyses. Higher-quality father–child relationships were associated with higher levels of social competence (B= 0.19,SE= 0.06,p= .002) and positive peer relationships (B= 0.05,SE= 0.02,p= .005). Significant interaction effects were found. The positive association between father–child relationships and peer relationships was significantly stronger among children with a history of maltreatment perpetrated by fathers with or without mothers (B= 0.16,SE= 0.05,p= .002). Findings highlight the importance of positive father–child relationships in building social resilience among children who experience maltreatment. Practitioners working with youth who are at risk for maltreatment should consider engaging fathers in services to support the development of strong father–child relationships.
Youth of color residing in urban areas face elevated risks of vicarious police contact which can intensify feelings of fear, anger, and cynicism toward law enforcement. However, little is known as to how vicarious police stops are patterned across youths’ social circles and how these diverse vicarious exposures shape youths’ attitudes toward and stress about police. The current study analyzed data from the Survey of Police-Adolescent Contact Experiences, a cross-sectional survey of Black youth aged 12–21 in Baltimore City, Maryland (n= 345). Youth self-reported whether they knew anyone who has been stopped by police and selected their relation to who was stopped. They also reported how often they, themselves, engaged in efforts to avoid police, how stressed they were about police violence in their community, and their attitudes of policy legitimacy. The study used descriptive statistics, OLS regression, and ancillary attenuation analyses using the Karlson-Holm-Breen method. Results showed that over 50% of youth knew someone stopped by police, with 12% reporting four or more known persons. Analyses indicated that knowing more individuals stopped by police was associated with increased avoidance and stress while being linked to decreased perceptions of police legitimacy – findings particularly salient for those with four or more known persons stopped by police. Additionally, knowing a friend stopped by police significantly increased both police avoidance and stress levels. These findings underscore the importance of understanding vicarious police contact patterns within youths’ social circles and their implications for stress and attitudes about the police, emphasizing the need to foster positive police-youth relationships and address stress-related outcomes.
Participatory sense-making is already an established concept within enactivism. It is used to define the participatory nature of cognitive relations, designating that humans and other organisms make sense of their surrounding environments not just on their own. They build cooperative networks, working together, to create ways of making sense of the world. However, so far little attention has been paid to how enactive concepts, such as participatory sense-making, may apply to the field of bioethics, understood here as health care ethics. In this paper, I examine health care practices cases of participatory sense-making. The paper aims to show that relations between patients and health care providers (HCPs) can be understood as participatory sense-making relations. To make my case, I discuss the so-called phenomenological interview, as proposed technique in health care. I argue that this interview technique has essential features that can be viewed also as features of participatory sense-making. More specifically, the phenomenological interview is an open-minded, a critical, and pro-active dialogue between patient and health care provider that is meant for the patient to raise self-awareness of their body and medical condition, as well as of the social conditions that may affect that experience and condition. I will argue that phenomenological interviews are exemplary cases of patient-health care provider relations in which both parties actively work together to make sense of what the patient is going through and to find adequate medical responses to that experience. I will conclude by proposing normative guidance based on my analysis of health care practice as participatory sense-making. I argue that viewing patient-HCP relations as participatory sense-making may be helpful for both patients and health care providers in that it shows that health care practice is not just a technical exercise or routine task, but essentially relational and patient-oriented.
PurposeThe Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is widely used to screen for depression in clinical practice and to assess symptoms of depression in research about older adults. To determine whether the 15-item GDS can be used in adults with dementia, this study investigated whether item- or test-level bias in the GDS-15 is associated with the respondent’s level of cognitive impairment.MethodsUsing a large U.S. sample of 24,674 adults, we first conducted sample matching procedures between the five groups defined by CDR® Dementia Staging Instrument scores to control for potential confounding effects of common demographic variables. Then, we employed confirmatory factor analysis (for single-group and configural-invariance models only) and item response theory models to test potential differential item/test functioning effects associated with the GDS-15 across the five CDR groups. Practical consequences of the identified biases were quantified using sample-based Cohen’s d effect sizes and misclassification rates.ResultsIn general, people with higher CDR scores were older and had fewer years of education. In comparison to the normal cognition group (CDR–0), negligible biases in GDS-15 scores were found for the groups with questionable, mild, or moderate cognitive impairment (CDR–0.5/1/2). For individuals with severe cognitive impairment (CDR–3), their responses were inconsistent with the normal cognition group and their depression scores were significantly biased with a small-to-medium effect size.ConclusionsThe GDS-15 can be used to assess depression in individuals with mild or moderate cognitive impairment, but not in individuals with severe cognitive impairment.
The aims of this study were to explore the influence of shift working nursing professionals’ psychological inflexibility on their level of insomnia. Additionally, we investigated the mediation effect of depression and sleep-related cognitions on this association. An online survey was conducted among 202 nursing professionals at Asan Medical Center from July to August, 2023. Participants responded to questionnaires including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II), Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep − 16 (DBAS-16), Glasgow Sleep Effort Scale (GSES), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9), and the Discrepancy between desired time in bed and desired total sleep time index (DBST index). Pearson’s correlation and linear regression were performed to explore the factors predicting ISI scores. Mediation analysis was implemented. Linear regression revealed that insomnia severity was predicted by DBAS-16 (β = 0.15,p= 0.008), GSES (β = 0.48,p< 0.001), and PHQ-9 (β = 0.26,p< 0.001). Mediation analysis showed that the relationship between the psychological inflexibility of shift-working nursing professionals’ and insomnia severity was fully mediated by depression, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep effort. Psychological inflexibility does not directly influence insomnia severity, but depression, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep effort fully mediate the relationship.
This paper examines the lived experiences of LGBTQ+ displaced individuals in Kakuma refugee camp, Kenya. Drawing on situated knowledge and relational agency, it delves into how queer people experience the humanitarian-aid system on-site, what risks they encounter, and how they exert agency to cope with the prevalent challenges of day to day life. Findings reveal that, in a country context where same-sex relations are illegalized and queer people criminalized, those displaced face heightened risks. They are confronted with the heteronormative paradigms inherent to the humanitarian-aid system, ones resulting in their neglect and denied access to much-needed assistance and protection. Structural and physical violence such as discrimination, exclusion, harassment and threats of murder exacerbate unrelenting fears and tangible risks in the camp. To navigate these challenges, they employ diverse individual and especially collective coping strategies, creating safe spaces for mutual support, exchange and hope.
In this paper I introduce and explicate the concept of “class blindness,” and show how it works to obscure and justify class inequality even in a small community in which social divisions are well recognized. Similar to the concept of color-blind racism, class blindness is a discursive strategy to erase and minimize class privilege and the social processes by which class inequality is created and perpetuated. Denial of these processes, and the social-structural roots of class advantage and disadvantage, undermines efforts to effectively address societal problems born of social class inequality. I show how class blindness allows those with privilege to police their social positions and secure resource hoarding within a community while holding the disadvantaged personally responsible for their struggles. I further describe how class blindness allows advantaged individuals to express concern about social problems including poverty and inequality in the abstract, while acting in ways that contribute to its perpetuation on the micro and the macro levels. This qualitative case study, based in 84 interviews and 10 months of participant observation with individuals across the class spectrum, illustrates the processes that contribute to the reproduction of social inequality even among those whose ideological stances include commitment to its reduction.
The current study explores how organizational dimensions relate to and impact organizational commitment, comparing staff in academic positions with staff in professional services roles. Data was collected from 281 academic and 294 professional services staff within university environments who completed extensive questionnaires. Overall academics manifested lower levels of emotional attachment to, and perceived obligation to remain in their university, felt less safe to take interpersonal risks, to speak up and lower support for their work-life balance than their professional services colleagues. The perception of procedural fairness and discrimination impacted academics loyalty and felt obligation to remain and reciprocate organizational investments to a higher extent. Psychological safety positively influenced staff’s commitment. Emotional and obligation-based types of commitment were more strongly affected by psychological safety among academics than professional services staff. Finally, work-life balance support positively influenced staff’s commitment, appearing to be an equally important dimension to drive emotional and obligation-based types of commitment from both academics and professional services staff. This study brings important contributions to research on the working environment of academics and professional services staff and indicates that development of clear policies to promote and maintain fairness, psychological safety and work-life balance, together with active monitoring and evaluation of their impact, should be a key focus for higher education institutions.
Drawing on a study of how young people in Switzerland appropriate urban public space, this article explores what we term “regimes of self-presentation” among youth in both online and offline spaces. We address issues of privacy and power that help shape such regimes by applying an expanded notion of street credibility that encompasses digital practices. Our concept of “digital street credibility” recognizes how, in today’s world, any social or cultural practices engaged in by youth have two potential types of audiences. One is physically present, consisting of other users of urban public space. The second audience is media-based, consisting of people with access to live or prerecorded digital content captured on smartphones and shared on social networks. This situation has forced young people to develop new and specific social conventions governing self-presentation. The article highlights the complex and perilous nature of visibility management. Where privacy and power relations are concerned, a very thin line separates behavior that enhances an individual’s social status from actions considered “embarrassing” or “cringe.” Our results show how, in the streets as well as online, acceptable forms of visibility are determined on the basis of digital street credibility. These findings suggest a need to reconsider young people’s understanding of privacy, as it relates to their leisure activities in urban and digital spaces.
While conventional literature on intergenerational mobility emphasizes parental investment as the main driver of children’s human capital, recent studies highlight the role of neighborhood effects. This paper aims to characterize neighborhood human capital (the average educational levels within neighborhoods) to clarify its impact on intergenerational educational mobility. Using data from China’s 1% population survey, we uncover a positive and statistically significant correlation between neighborhood human capital and rank-based intergenerational mobility in education. Moreover, by exploiting the address code to identify varying scales of neighborhoods, from the narrowest communities to the broadest provinces, we construct a comprehensive understanding of neighborhood human capital. Specifically, we find that neighborhood human capital at the community level has the greatest impact on mobility, followed by the street, district, county, and province levels, respectively. Our results are robust to a series of concerns such as endogeneity issues and sample selection problems. Further investigations confirm that residential segregation may distort the relationship between neighborhood human capital and intergenerational mobility. Specifically, stratified neighborhoods are likely to persist and reinforce disparities in educational attainment and intergenerational mobility. While acknowledging its significance at narrower scales, this study suggests that policymakers focus more on neighborhood capital’s spillover effects at broader levels. Such a focus has the potential to promote greater equity in access to high-quality public education, alleviate the adverse effects of residential segregation, and improve intergenerational mobility.
Despite the common premise of the link between childhood exposure to gender-based violence (GBV) and future adult victimization or perpetration, the literature concerning this association is not entirely consistent. Different studies have reported no significant associations. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of GBV exposure during childhood on the presence of GBV during adulthood. A survey with 32 questions distributed in 8 blocks was administered to 1541 Spaniards over 18 years of age. The results show that people whose mothers were victims of GBV have constructed an identity positioned against GBV to a greater extent than the general population. This identity is evident through their social activism in the fight against GBV and their tendency to help when they witness or become aware of situations of GBV. In turn, they have acquired more knowledge about what to do and/or how to intervene in cases of GBV. On the other hand, 70% of Spanish women who have suffered GBV in their lifetime affirm that their mothers did not suffer from GBV when they were young. In Spain, exposure to GBV during childhood does not necessarily lead to the reproduction of such violence in future intimate partner relationships. We thus question the intergenerational transmission of violence in the case of both victims and perpetrators.
The debates on durable solutions for refugees takes place in the absence of well-designed measures for monitoring and assessing integration processes in protracted displacement contexts. Addressing this gap, this study develops a multidimensional measure of refugee integration by introducing conceptual modifications to the key components of immigrant integration framework offered by Ager and Strang. Leveraging survey data from 1630 Syrian refugees in Turkey, a typical forced migration context in the Global South, this study employs a structural equation modeling approach to capture the multifaceted refugee integration process. The proposed multidimensional construct contributes to research into immigrant integration in two significant ways. Firstly, the proposed measurement model overcomes the limitations of aggregative/compensative models commonly used to assess integration outcomes by also enabling the examination of relationships between various domains of integration. Secondly, by acknowledging the precarity inherent in forced migration contexts in the Global South, the multidimentional measure facilitates the monitoring and assessment of refugee integration in protracted displacement contexts. The proposed measurement model facilitates a nuanced understanding of the relationships among conceptual dimensions of the multifaceted integration process and offers a methodologically sound tool for comparison of integration outcomes across refugee groups and over time in protracted displacement contexts of the Global South.
This article explores the practice of a distinct ‘gaze’ present in creative urban youth subcultures. We focus on sticker artists in St. Petersburg and graffiti writers in Helsinki while exploring how this subcultural gaze is formed and enacted among subcultural youth in different socio-political contexts. The idea of this article emerged, when we noticed that we have through our case studies learned different subcultural ways of looking at ‘spots’ in urban space. Spots can be understood as distinct subcultural places in the city space, that reveal communication and control of unauthorised youth practices. We use examples from the respective ethnographic fieldworks and complement them with photographs taken from spots in the field. Drawing from our fieldwork in these two cities, we further illustrate how youth within these subcultures reinterpret and visualize urban spaces through their unique subcultural lens. Both recognition and control in the city space serve as dynamic forces shaping this gaze in a creative interplay in urban environments.
This study explores the emerging socio-cultural trends and digital influences among Chinese youth engaging in ecotourism, against the backdrop of increasing discontent with capitalist modernity and hyper-competition. Drawing on fieldwork and social media analysis, the research examines how platforms like Xiaohongshu shape travel behaviors and endorse sustainable practices. The study focuses on the “lying flat” movement, a reaction against relentless societal pressures, and its role in propelling young people towards nature-based tourism. It investigates the dual nature of ecotourism as both an escape from and a reinforcement of capitalist dynamics, highlighting the performative role of digital content in constructing travel aspirations. By employing Karen Barad’s agential realism and Robert Fletcher’s critique of ecotourism, the paper situates these trends within China’s socio-economic landscape and global neoliberal patterns. The findings reveal a complex interplay where ecotourism fosters individual fulfilment and community building while potentially contributing to the homogenization of cultural and natural landscapes. This study underscores the importance of critically examining how digital media and socio-economic factors co-create new forms of environmental engagement, influencing both the preservation and commodification of ecological and cultural diversity. Future research should address the broader implications of these dynamics, aiming to promote more inclusive and sustainable tourism practices that respect local diversities in an increasingly interconnected world.
Resettlement to a third country offers a durable solution for refugees who cannot integrate into their asylum or transit countries. While most studies focus on the experiences of refugees after their arrival in resettlement countries or on the political aspects of resettlement, fewer studies explore refugees’ perspectives prior to resettlement. This paper examines how Rohingyas in Malaysia view their resettlement opportunities. We collected qualitative micronarratives from 56 adult Rohingyas living in Malaysia between March and September 2019, to explore the complexities of their decision-making processes. The findings indicate that most Rohingyas aspire to resettle in another country to gain legal status or citizenship, providing a better future for their children, including access to education and healthcare. However, preferences among Rohingyas vary: while some are eager to resettle, others express a strong desire to return to their home country in Myanmar. Still, others wish to reunite with family in Myanmar or Bangladesh, and a significant minority are reluctant to resettle in non-Islamic countries, reflecting broader concerns about cultural and religious compatibility. This study highlights the varied resettlement preferences among Rohingyas, underscoring the need for resettlement policies to consider these diverse priorities to enhance the effectiveness of resettlement programs.
Questions are an essential aspect of decision-making by families and early educators in a range of contexts, and are particularly important during the informal assessment and collaborative planning that characterize home visits. Yet recommendations for questions tend to focus on form alone, such as encouragement to ask open- rather than closed-ended questions. These recommendations have limited practical application because they frame language as decontextualized and power-free, which can contribute to marginalizing families. Instead, when early educators conceptualize questions as part of discourse—rooted in context and imbued with power—they can better understand nuances of questions and ultimately enact shared decision-making with families. This conceptual paper illustrates the potential of discourse theory as a framework to explore questions and their consequences for decision-making power. Linguistic features of questions are presented along with discursive tools adapted from Gee (2014) that researchers and early educators can use to examine how questions contribute to sharing power or maintaining professional control of decisions. Transcripts from previously conducted, ethically approved investigations using discourse analysis exemplify how the tools can be used to examine how questions function in real conversations between families of infants and toddlers and home visitors. The selected transcripts represent four different home visiting programs in the United States and depict how questions played in role in decision-making about how to support children’s development.
The sacred physical landscape is significant in evoking emotions and experiencing an intense embodied connection specific to a place. In South Asia, widowhood has evolved from long-standing social inequalities; it is a performance and a life stage as well as a focal point of ambivalent intergenerational relations at the cusp of adaptation and disenfranchisement. The collision between gender and caste hinders Hindu widows from retaining assets, leaving them in financial distress. This paper weighs the continuities and discontinuities in dignified living in the backdrop of the ‘sacred geography’ of Nabadwip. Situated in eastern India, Nabadwip is revered as a pilgrim site. This sacred element aside, Nabadwip is also home to ageing widows abandoned by their adult children. They flank the temple gates and wait for alms while dabbingchandan(sandalwood) on their foreheads, immersed in thekirtan(devotional music) on the temple premises. The congregation of older widows, residents, and pilgrims shapes the layered geography of Nabadwip. Sifting through in-depth qualitative interviews and ethnographic findings, this paper frames arguments through the prisms of feminist geography, life course approach, and care poverty. Disruptions across the life course due to rifts with adult children emerge as the paramount reason for widows fleeing to Nabadwip. However, the grid of gender, age, and poverty worsens the widowhood penalty, thus leading to a descent into lifelong suffering. Although women are encultured to be the primary caregivers and kinkeepers, the lack of access to care and dignity for Nabadwip’s widows borders on the abject and calls for social concern.
The social construction of pregnancy emphasizes the mother’s responsibility for the developing fetus. Hence, certain activities, such as participation in competitive sport, are often constructed as inappropriate during pregnancy. While expert opinion tends to stress caution, the diversity of athlete mothers’ experiences challenge these dominant discourses. Less is known about how peers and other stakeholders in sport view the participation of pregnant athletes. Knowledge of such attitudes is essential to understanding the position of women in a specific society and the barriers to their autonomy. Hence, we examined survey responses from different sport stakeholders (N= 540) in Finland. Drawing on relational dialectics theory (Baxter, L. A. (2011).Voicing relationships. Sage.), we used contrapuntal analysis to identify different discourses on the compatibility of pregnancy and sport, and their interplay. Three discourses were identified: an equality discourse, which emphasizes that sport belongs to everyone, and that pregnant people should be accepted and supported in sporting environments; a responsibility discourse, which constructs pregnancy as fragility and sport as potentially dangerous for the athlete and the fetus; and an incompatibility discourse, which constructs pregnancy as a disease and unacceptable in sporting environments. Our analysis shows that medicalized, authoritative knowledge is the master strategy used to keep women out of male social spaces during pregnancy. The findings of our study highlight the ongoing struggle for reproductive justice in a patriarchal world order. To advance women’s position in society and support the autonomy of all individuals, viable professional guidelines and organizational policies must be formulated and applied.
A dominant narrative among men’s rights activists (MRAs) is that rape culture does not exist. Despite statistical evidence that men are more likely to be sexually assaulted than wrongfully accused of assault, false rape allegations are the most frequently discussed topic on MRA forums and websites. In this study, we analyzed comments about false rape allegations posted to r/MensRights, a popular MRA forum. Just as the larger MRA movement emerged as a reactionary counterbalance to a feminist movement that MRAs believe has purportedly achieved equality, we found that MRAs construct a culture of false rape allegations to counterbalance a purportedly non-existent rape culture. Using a grounded theory approach to examine the narratives deployed by MRAs, we discovered that these men construct what we call a “compensatory culture of injury.” We found that MRAs are driven by “aspirational oppression,”which we theorize as a sense of grievance surrounding a group’s diminishing privilege and desire to achieve the guise of subjugation that warrants reparations to restore the status quo in the ostensible pursuit of fairness and equality. This co-optation of victimhood may be challenged by structural conversations about gender as well as the explicit identification of the misogynistic nature of MRA narratives.
PurposeYoung people in youth residential care report high rates of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), e.g., abuse and neglect in their families. Various studies show ACEs to impair social participation and mental health, whereas less is known about how ACEs are associated with quality of life (QoL). The aim of the current study is to (1) evaluate the association between ACEs and psychological, physical, social, and environmental QoL in young adult care leavers, and (2) to examine how self-efficacy and self-directedness mediate this association.Methods179 formerly out-of-home placed young adults (Mage= 26.5, 33.4% women, response rate = 30.3%) were queried at baseline with the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory Revised (JTCI 12-18-R) and at a 10-year follow-up with the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) and the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (WHOQoL-BREF).ResultsPrevalence rates for ACEs were high, with 87.2% of participants experiencing at least one type of ACE. Cumulative ACEs were associated with lower QoL in all four domains. Self-efficacy (β = -0.111, [-0.187, -0.044]) and self-directedness (β = -0.052, [-0.123, -0.004]) partially mediated the association between severity of ACEs and overall QoL.ConclusionsACEs increase the risk for a lower QoL of young adult care leavers. Results underline the importance of prevention and early intervention efforts for troubled young people and their families, as well as the importance of pedagogical work during residential care. Additional to research on functional outcomes, studies investigating well-being and quality of life in this at-risk populations are needed.
Existing studies have explored gender representation in reality shows, and the influence of such representations on viewers. In this study, I engage how female participants in romantic relationships on theBig Brother Nigeriareality show propagate and contest gender stereotypes. I answer the question: how have the propagation and contestation of extant gender ideologies been used to achieve fame and popularity on and beyond the show? I undertake a close reading of selected videos and comments from theBig BrotherYouTube Channel across three editions of the show. I focus on the influence of showmance on the show’s competitors and how the female participants utilise their sexuality, gender identities, and gender stereotypes. I apply Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of agency towards analysing how female agency is negotiated within a space where men and women contest for fame and popularity. The analysis reveals that BBN is a field of cultural production where women’s choices are effectively intentional and strategic in their contestation for fame and success.
Union dissolution has severe consequences for women’s economic well-being. Theoretical work links these consequences to ethnic inequality. Ethnic groups vary in terms of separation rates, female employment, repartnering trajectories, kin support, and reliance on welfare benefits. The current study examines whether ethnicity moderates the dissolution penalty. To do so, the authors draw on register data, covering women from five major ethnic groups in the Netherlands: Dutch, Antillean, Surinamese, Moroccan, and Turkish. The authors describe women’s income trajectories from 1 year before to 5 years after union dissolution. Using decomposition techniques, changes in household income are decomposed into changes in six underlying income sources (i.e., earnings, benefits, alimony, partner income, and coresident family income). The results show that ethnicity moderates the dissolution penalty and, especially, the contribution of the various income sources when recovering from dissolution.
The importance of safe spaces for LGBTQ + folks cannot be understated, especially as these safe spaces are becoming more limited due to discrimination against and hostility towards the LGBTQ + community. This is especially true for LGBTQ + individuals and couples living in difficult political climates, where there is egregious anti-LGBTQ + rhetoric and blatant legal attacks on this minoritized population. Compounded trauma, influenced by the intersection of many identities held, manifests in adverse individual and relational effects. The present study explores a Queer couple’s experience living in a difficult political climate and their experience in therapy. Systemic therapists have made great strides in validating and centering sexual and gender minority identities and experiences, however there is less research into the impact of discrimination on a relational level for Queer couples in therapy. The themes from this qualitative case study highlight the individual and couple level impacts of larger systems. Implications and suggestions for systemic therapists working with LGBTQ + clients are presented using an intersectional and trauma-informed lens.
When preschool teachers attempt to initiate play-responsive science teaching, opportunities arise to develop or challenge the play further, for example, by introducing or focusing on science content. The aim of this article is to generate knowledge about how projected images and videos can be used in attempted play-responsive science teaching and what they can contribute to. Eleven preschool teachers participated in a Continuous Professional Development project about play-responsive teaching and science. Participating preschool teachers’ discussions about using projected images or videos in attempted play-responsive science teaching was thematically analysed. Three main themes have been developed: content of the projected image or video, different ways of using projected images or videos, and reasons for using a projected image or video in attempted play-responsive science teaching. Results show that projections could be used as support in play, e.g., when imagining being in another place, like under the surface of the ocean or as a way of introducing science concepts in play. Play-responsive science teaching with support of projected images and videos is found to be a threefold challenge for the preschool teachers, encompassing knowledge about play, science, and digital tools. The important role of preschool teachers in making the projections become a part of play-responsive science teaching is discussed.
Little is known concerning the association between community care services availability and quality of life. The objective of the present paper is to examine the association between community care services availability and quality of life. The data were sourced from 2018 wave of Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Ordered logit regression models were applied to examine the correlation of community care services availability and quality of life. Both binary logit regression models and generalized random forest models were used for robustness checks. There is a strong positive relationship of community care services availability and quality of life (coefficient = 0.3103,p< 0.01). Robustness checks using binary logit regression models and generalized random forest models report similar results. Heterogeneity analysis results reveal that the relationship of community care services availability and quality of life differs by age, gender, and residency area. Impact channel analysis results show that social participation is a channel involving the association of community care services availability and quality of life. It is of great significance for Chinese government to improve community care services availability.
Scholars draw increasing attention to the importance of belonging for young refugees’ and migrants’ well-being, indicating the need to develop an in-depth understanding of their experiences seeking to belong in resettlement. For refugee and migrant newcomers, schools might constitute particularly significant spaces in their negotiation of belonging, due to being a central developmental and acculturative context in resettlement, and a context where newcomers are situated within interpersonal and cultural positions of their families, home, and host society. Rooted in a conceptualization of belonging as a dynamic, plural, and relationally negotiated experience, this study explores how young newcomers’ negotiation of belonging takes shape within the school context and how their experiences seeking to belong relate to their well-being. To that, the study engages with the qualitative inquiry of 163 newcomers’ (age 11–24) experiences through focus groups conducted in Belgium, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Cross-national, joint thematic analysis resulted in two themes: 1. Ambivalences shaping belonging; and 2. Challenging barriers to belonging. Our findings suggest that, in school, newcomers meet opportunities and barriers in their negotiation of belonging that takes shape at the intersection of family, transnational, and host society relations. Schools furthermore seem central spaces for newcomers to exercise agency and creativity in their search for belonging in resettlement. Our findings spark thought on belonging as a reconstructive process in coping with migration and have implications for how schools can support belonging and well-being, through engaging with life stories of migration and the plurality of meanings encroaching upon newcomers’ school trajectories.
This paper considers the development of new clinical and medical practices in the early 2000s in France, after the adoption of legal reforms aiming at the prevention of sexual infractions and the protection of minors. The paper explains how the reform led to the creation of a new form of punishment for sexual offenders, l’obligation de soin(therapeutic obligation), which can be described as long-term mandatory therapeutic monitoring. This paper offers an analysis of the implementation of this measure from the standpoint of the specialized mental health care unit which were entrusted the mission of caring for the new group of convicted patients, i.e., patients sentenced to undergo mandatory therapy, after this legal reform. In the new regime these mandatory therapies created, clinicians are tasked to combine their conventional mission of care for the patient in the present, with the judicial mandate of detecting and preventing the patient’s relapse qua recidivism in the future. Mobilizing ethnographic examples that evidence the way clinical care comes to encompass a penal mandate of long-term surveillance of convicted patients, I argue that the dual injunction of procuring care while preventing relapse-recidivism constrains the psychodynamic forms of clinical intervention deployed by French clinicians, realigns both psychiatric and clinical interventions along penal lines, and revives interest in some of the diagnostic categories and aims of criminal psychiatry which were important for the development of psychiatry in France.
To examine the risks of long-term de novo psychiatric disease in women with primary infertiltiy compared to age-matched referrent women. Retrospective, population-based cohort of 1,001 women with primary infertility and 1,001 age-matched (± 1 year) referent women aged 18–50. The “index date” was date of first clinical note for infertility and included visits fromJanuary 1, 1980 to December 31, 1999. Baseline characteristics were collected by chart review. Outcome data was evaluated through December 31, 2020. Primary outcomes were baseline prevalence and de novo rates of subsequent psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, suicidality, and somatization evaluated by Cox proportional hazards modeling. Among women with primary infertility and referent women, the median duration of follow-up was 23.7 years. The risk of de novo psychiatric disorders was not significantly different between groups. Additionally, the risk of de novo psychiatric disorders did not significantly differ between those with isolated male factor versus isolated female factor infertility. Among women with primary infertility, the cumulative incidence of de novo depression and anxiety was significantly higher among women diagnosed with primary infertility in the 1990s compared to the 1980s. Women with primary infertility, in a historical population-based cohort, do not have a significantly different long-term risk of de novo psychiatric diagnoses compared to age-matched referent women. Our findings support the notion that infertility diagnosis and treatment present an acute period of stress and for some psychologic distress, neither of which persist or increase the risk for development of future psychiatric disease.
Migration forecasts are crucial for proactive immigration and integration management. While the demand for accurate migration forecasts continues to grow, the current state of migration forecasting is still unsatisfactory, because they tend to lack precision. We introduce an alternative method to forecast migration movements: prediction markets. While prediction markets are mainly unknown in migration studies, they are established in the political economy of forecasting election outcomes. For its application to a complex phenomenon in a more constrained information environment such as migration movements, we argue that prediction markets allow to balance complementarities of current qualitative and quantitative approaches if they provide solutions to avoid thin trading and integrate expert knowledge into the market. We apply the prediction market to forecast immigration in four West European countries in 2020 and find encouraging results. We discuss the strengths and limitations of prediction markets to migration forecasting, including ethical considerations, and guide its future application.
PurposeDetermining if group-level differences in health outcomes are meaningful has recently been neglected in favour of determining if individuals have experienced a meaningful change. We explore interpretation of a meaningful between-group difference (MBGD) in clinical outcome assessment scores, primarily in the context of randomized clinical trials.MethodsWe constructed a series of possible ‘viewpoints’ on how to conceptualize MBGD thresholds. Each viewpoint is discussed critically in terms of potential advantages and disadvantages, with simulated data to facilitate their consideration.ResultsFive viewpoints are presented and discussed. The first considers whether thresholds for meaningful within-individual change over time can be equally applied at the group-level, which is shown to be untenable. Viewpoints 2-4 consider what would have to be observed in treatment groups to conclude a meaningful between-group difference has occurred, framed in terms of the proportion of patients perceiving that they had meaningfully improved. The final viewpoint considers an alternative framework where stakeholders are directly questioned on the meaningfulness of varying magnitudes of between-group differences. The choice of a single threshold versus general interpretative guidelines is discussed.ConclusionThere does not appear to be a single method with clear face validity for determining MBGD thresholds. Additionally, the notion that such thresholds can be purely data-driven is challenged, where a degree of subjective stakeholder judgement is likely required. Areas for future research are proposed, to move towards robust method development.
PurposeTo assess the association between professional reintegration and mental health, quality of life (QoL) and community reintegration of stroke survivors.MethodsUsing a cross-sectional study design, a structured questionnaire was administered to previously working stroke survivors, 18–24 months post-stroke. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, professional reintegration (prevalence of return to work (RTW), period of RTW, job placement, function at work, reintegration support, association of stroke with work and number of working hours), mental health (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire), QoL (Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale) and community integration (Community Integration Questionnaire) were reported by 553 stroke survivors.ResultsTwenty months after stroke, 313 (56.6%; 95%CI 52.4–60.8) stroke survivors had return to work. RTW was positively associated with both global and sub-domains scores of Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) (global CIQ β = 3.50; 95%CI 3.30–3.79) and with depressive symptomatology (β = 0.63; 95%CI 0.20–1.46) measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. No significant differences were found regarding QoL, according to RTW status. For those who RTW, no significant associations were found between any of the professional reintegration determinants assessed and mental health, QoL and community integration scores.ConclusionsRTW seems to be associated to better community integration after stroke, but appears to be negatively associated to stroke survivor’s mental health, namely considering depression symptoms. Future studies should explore the barriers to stroke survivors’ RTW and the challenges and strategies used to overcome them, to allow the development of professional reintegration policies.
In this phenomenological study, we explored the play perceptions of parents with young children from low-income households in Türkiye. Data were collected through individual semi-structured interviews with 36 parents (18 mothers and 18 fathers), all of whom have children in their early childhood years. We transcribed the interviews and conducted a thematic analysis. The findings illuminate the diverse perceptions of children’s play among parents in low-income households, highlighting a shared recognition of play as a social activity and a source of joy, while also revealing differing views. Parents in the study generally value studying, health, and familial love and respect above play. Their control over children’s playtime is significantly influenced by concerns over academic performance and safety. Mothers are typically the primary participants in children’s play due to their increased presence at home, while fathers’ participation is significantly limited by work obligations and exhaustion.
Forgiveness is associated with one’s health and well-being as well as one’s religious beliefs. However, an instrument for measuring forgiveness has not been validated among Moroccans. The Enright Forgiveness Inventory–30 (EFI-30) is one of the most used instruments to measure interpersonal forgiveness and has been validated and adapted across various countries and languages. To validate the EFI-30 in the Moroccan context, we translated the original English EFI-30 into Arabic. A self-report measure of religiosity was also included. A sample of 709 adult Moroccans (75.2% women) was obtained. Confirmatory factor analysis showed good fit indices for the original six-factor structure (positive affect, negative affect, positive behavior, negative behavior, positive cognition, and negative cognition) of the EFI-30. The results on the relationship between religion (between Muslim and Christian participants), age and gender, and the forgiveness process are presented. The Arabic EFI-30 has been found to be a valid measure for forgiveness among Moroccans, serving as a useful tool for future research. Moreover, counselors could adopt the EFI-30 to screen clients and evaluate therapy outcomes.
ObjectivesThis study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated stay-at-home orders on the breastfeeding experiences of U.S. people a identify facilitators and barriers to breastfeeding during this period, and to assess the effects of maternal stress and misinformation on breastfeeding practices.MethodsU.S. women with infants were selected through purposive and convenience sampling. An online survey, distributed during summer 2020, measured changes in infant feeding practices, maternal stress levels, use of lactation support resources, and the influence of misinformation on feeding decisions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative responses underwent thematic analysis.ResultsOur sample (n = 1,861) revealed that 34% of U.S. women realized the pandemic affected their feeding practices, 544 women provided qualitative data. Major themes from qualitative analysis included ease of breastfeeding at home, bonding, increased breastfeeding duration, and challenges like limited access to lactation support. Logistic regressions highlighted demographic influences on breastfeeding practices, with no significant effects found related to the child's age or women's income on changes in feeding practices.Conclusions for PracticeThe COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted breastfeeding experiences of U.S. women, yielding insights for future policy and healthcare practices. The findings underscore the potential benefits of telehealth lactation support services and flexible remote work environments for breastfeeding people. Clear and scientifically-grounded communication regarding breastfeeding, mental health support, and policy development, are essential to promote equitable and flexible work and maternity leave options for breastfeeding people especially during global health crises.
Self-stigma is a major barrier to personal and clinical recovery in people with mental illness. Although psychosocial interventions have been developed to reduce self-stigma, the exploration of group CBT-based interventions for hospitalised patients are less represented. The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness of a group CBT-based intervention aiming to reduce self-stigma and improve recovery-related outcomes such as self-esteem, stigma resistance and sense of coherence, which comes down to saying, “I am what I am”. A total of 104 patients admitted to the inpatient therapy were recruited to participate in a randomised controlled clinical trial, and 77 participants (46 in the intervention group and 31 in the control group) completed the trial. Constructs of interest were measured before and after the intervention. The results showed that the evaluated intervention was effective in improving sense of coherence and stigma resistance, compared to treatment as usual (TAU). The level of self-stigma significantly decreased in both the intervention and control groups, but no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups. The limitations of the study include: the lack of assessment of the sustainability of the effects of therapy (follow-up), the presence of intensive interventions of the ward’s programme and patients pre-qualified for the ward based on admission criteria. The intervention “I am what I am,” has proven to be effective, especially in increasing the level of personal resources needed to build clinical and personal recovery and to counteract the negative consequences of self-stigma.
We explore the relationship between global zoonotic disease incidents and international wildlife trade in Ghana and provide an in-depth analysis of taxon trade trends from 1975 to 2018 by combining zoonotic disease data (published sources) with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) database. Trends over this period show that reptiles (Pythonidae) were the most frequently traded, followed by birds (Psittacidae), mammals (Cercopithecidae) (classified under CITES Appendix 1), and amphibians (Dendrobatidae). Overall trade (export/import) did not differ significantly among the four periods: 1975–1985, 1986–1996, 1997–2007, and 2008–2018 (H = 4.99,p= 0.166). Most countries that export wildlife to Ghana are in Africa, and those countries that import wildlife from Ghana are in Europe and the USA. Trade of reptiles and birds, especially endangered pythons andPsittacusspecies, could lead to their extinction in the wild. Our study model reveals that the higher the incidence of zoonotic diseases, the higher the incidence of exports of reptiles (coeff. = 0.30,p< 0.001) and birds (coeff. = 0.49,p< 0.001) but the lower incidence of mammalian exports (coeff. = -0.45,p< 0.001), suggesting a relationship between the incidence of zoonotic diseases and a decrease in mammal specimen trade. Early detection of zoonotic diseases and the adoption of an expanded education module to avoid risks in bushmeat utilization will also help reduce wildlife trade.
The entrance into the Anthropocene Epoch has pushed historians and social scientists to reconsider human history through new lenses and along an entirely different timeline. For historians, the notion of the Anthropocene can be seen as an overarching category superimposed on the usual chronological divisions into ancient, medieval, modern, and contemporary history. In social sciences in general, the notion of the Anthropocene has been embraced, often critically, by enlarging its semantic field through a series of neologisms, which this article aims to analyze and contribute to. Originating from within stratigraphy and geology, the new coining for a (not yet official) epoch acts as a tectonic shift by bringing geology into history, as well as into humanities and social sciences. Paradoxically, it could be said that humans are being “ejected from history” just as geology enriches itself with a human-centered eponym, Anthropocene, that is, when specific actions carried out by a single biological species,homo sapiens, have spawned consequences so deep and everlasting that an imprint upon the Earth’s stratigraphy has been impressed forever. These specific actions can be encapsulated in a single term: overconsumption, possibly accompanied by its twin dimension, overexploitation (of resources). This article sets out to identify the period and sequence of events leading to the shift from consumption to overconsumption and from exploitation to overexploitation. Identifying the moment these transitions occurred is essential, as the double excess of “over” patterns has characterized what is commonly understood as the Anthropocene Epoch.
Though ADHD is the most common pediatric diagnosis in community mental health clinics (CMHCs), little is known about its diagnostic accuracy in these settings. We characterize CMHC diagnostic patterns for ADHD and common comorbidities with attention to gender and racial/ethnic disparities and the impact of misdiagnosis on evidence-based treatment implementation. Culturally diverse adolescents with a primary diagnosis of ADHD (N=278) completed comprehensive research team diagnostic assessments. Concurrently, they were assessed at one of four CMHCs in a large United States city. CMHC psychiatric diagnoses were obtained from electronic health records and compared to best practices research diagnoses. Mixed methods analyses characterized diagnostic agreement, racial/ethnic and gender disparities, and the effect of missed ADHD diagnoses on treatment implementation, as well as agency staff perceptions of barriers and facilitators to accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic agreement was unacceptable for all diagnoses (k=.02 to .19). CMHCs provided an ADHD diagnosis to 65.4% of best practices diagnosed participants. Female gender and White race were associated with missed ADHD diagnoses (often in favor of depressive or adjustment disorders) and CMHCs demonstrated overdiagnosis of conduct disorder (CD) in African American youth. Missed ADHD diagnoses predicted clinician deviation from evidence-based treatment for ADHD. Agency stakeholders noted systemic barriers and clinician beliefs and biases that may contribute to diagnostic inaccuracy and made suggestions for future practice. CMHCs might review their ADHD diagnostic practices to identify contributors to misdiagnosis, such as racial and gender biases, clinician inexperience, and systemic disincentives for careful diagnosis. Adopting systematic diagnostic practices such as pursuing parent and teacher ratings, consulting the DSM when diagnosing, and integrating supervisors into diagnostic process may be helpful.
Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we assessed the degree of poverty and disability among the elderly by a multidimensional indicator system and estimated the effects of disability on the incidence, depth, and duration of poverty, as well as Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI)’s effectiveness on poverty alleviating. Our results revealed that there was a significant correlation between the degree of disability and multidimensional poverty; with increasing levels of disability, there was a corresponding increase in probability from non-poor to poor status, severity, and duration of multidimensional poverty. As a protective policy for elderly individuals with disabilities, LTCI did not reduce the degree of disability of the disabled elderly while significantly contributing to the substantive care services enjoyed by them and also was not effective in eradicating multidimensional poverty suffered by disabled elderly due to the combination of its crowding-out effect on intergenerational economic support and family care, and its limited ability to improve objective health. The findings have significant implications in poverty governance, health management, and improvement of life quality among older adults, as well as in the advancement of LTCI for policymakers and practitioners.
ObjectivesTo investigate the association between maternal cervical cancer (CC) screening status and child human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake. To understand if child sex or social deprivation index (SDI) modify this association.MethodsWe used a national cohort of children linked to at least one parent using electronic health record (EHR) data from a network of community health centers across the United States. We used SDI scores and child sex as moderating variables. We performed the analysis (1) for the whole sample (with SDI and child sex added as covariates), (2) stratified by SDI quartile (with child sex added as a covariate), and (3) stratified by SDI quartileandchild sex, to examine whether associations vary by SDI quartile and by child sex.ResultsN = 52,919 linked mother–child pairs. Mother’s receipt of CC screening was positively associated with the linked child’s odds of receiving HPV vaccination [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32, 1.47]. Neither sex or SDI modified this association. There were no significant differences in odds of HPV vaccination in children between SDI quartiles or between male and female children.Conclusions for PracticeAn effective way to improve rates of HPV vaccination among children and adolescents may be to target attention towards increasing CC screening rates among mothers. Further, focusing resources and efforts on CC screenings and care of both mothers and their children may be more worthwhile than isolated efforts targeting HPV vaccination for children and adolescents.
IntroductionExposure to unfavorable environmental conditions during pregnancy, such as extreme heat and air pollution, has been linked to increased risk of stillbirth, defined as fetal mortality at or after 20 weeks’ gestation, however no studies have examined its association with social vulnerability. We examined associations between county-level stillbirth rates, environmental risk factors for stillbirth, and social vulnerability in the United States.MethodsThis ecologic study linked county-level data from three nationwide datasets on stillbirths (National Vital Statistics System), environmental conditions (North American Land Data Assimilation System and Environmental Protection Agency), and social vulnerability (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Social Vulnerability Index). Poisson and negative binomial models were fit to the variables and produced rate ratios to estimate associations among stillbirth rates, environmental risk factors, and social vulnerability.ResultsSocial vulnerability was positively associated withn stillbirth rates, annual average number of extreme heat days, and ambient concentration of particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5). The average number of days that ozone and PM2.5 each exceeded regulatory standards were not associated with stillbirth rates or social vulnerability. A positive association between average annual PM2.5 concentration and stillbirth rates was detected; no other significant associations between environmental risk factors and stillbirth rates were observed.DiscussionWe found evidence of associations between social vulnerability and stillbirth rates, and between social vulnerability and environmental risk factors for stillbirth at the county level. Further research could inform understanding of how social vulnerability impacts the relationship between environmental exposures and stillbirth risk.
This study uses the case of ecological protests in the Russian Federation and the social network of 903 263 VKontakte users to investigate the unique characteristics of protesters’ social networks and assess the effects of network topology on the likelihood of participation. By applying Bayesian structural equation modeling to the data, the study finds that social network topology plays a more nuanced and complex role in predicting protest participation beyond simple exposure to information. Notably, individuals situated as brokers in lower-density and higher-closure networks exhibit a higher likelihood of participation, while central nodes participate less. The results highlight the importance of strategic positioning as brokers for increasing the likelihood of participation. The paper discusses these and other findings, contributing to a deeper understanding of the interplay between social network structures and protest participation.
The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) constitutes a major policy reform for Australian people with disabilities. Despite its ten-year implementation, little is known about the characteristics of the workforce delivering Australia’s NDIS early childhood intervention services (ECI). The present study sought to identify the range of skills, knowledge, and experience of ECI professionals as listed in recruitment advertisements, and their alignment with best practice guidelines. Provider data were extracted from 246 advertisements for ECI roles over a 5-month period and assigned into various categories. Interrater reliability was determined by randomly selecting 65 of the 246 of the advertisements, which were coded independently by two researchers and assigned to service provider categories. Significant changes have occurred in the qualities of professionals providing ECI services under the NDIS, and their adherence to best practice guidelines. The limited emphasis on best practice in the recruitment process may result in an ECI workforce that is not well equipped to deliver specialised and inclusive support to young children with disabilities and their families.
The paper reflects on the limitations of Nigeria’s antitrafficking efforts, as they relate, particularly, to the complexities of victim-witnessing in the prosecution of sex trafficking cases. While much has been written about the institutional and cultural impediments to victim-witnessing in Nigeria or Nigerian-related sex trafficking cases, our work seeks to ask an often underplayed, if not ignored question: Can individuals existing under unjust structures find the impetus to assist the state advance the course of justice? We respond to this question by exploring the interrelationships between political failure, community-oriented trafficking and the moral quandary faced by intercepted victims who see trafficking as a conduit for economic mobility. Utilising Robert Merton’s strain theory, we highlight how the relational dynamics between traffickers and their victims within a community-oriented trafficking context underscore an innovation adjustment to the Mertonian strain. Against this background, we conclude that victim-witnessing is and will remain a challenge for Nigeria’s criminal justice response to trafficking because victims perceive their criminal exploiters as inextricably linked to their material wellbeing.
ObjectivesTo study how access to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) during the prenatal and early childhood periods affects long-term health outcomes of the affected cohorts.MethodsIn order to identify the effects of the WIC program, we exploit variations in the timing of its introduction in different counties and analyze future health indicators of affected cohorts. We use the restricted version of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which includes county-level identifiers through the interview year 2019.ResultsOur findings suggest that extending WIC access by one month correlates with a 0.2–0.3% point decrease in asthma incidence (p< 0.1 top< 0.01) of affected cohorts. Although the connection between WIC and asthma is not fully understood, existing studies suggest potential pathways. Micronutrient deficiencies during early life can impact immune function and inflammation, both relevant to asthma. Moreover, adopting healthier dietary habits may improve microbiome composition, lowering asthma risk. Other indirect benefits of WIC, such as increased use of preventive healthcare services, may also contribute to the prevention of asthma. Despite uncertainties, these estimates remain robust across various model specifications.Conclusions for PracticeOur study implies that early-life nutritional support programs such as WIC may alleviate the burden of asthma, although the specific mechanisms and effect sizes remain unclear. Given the substantial impact of asthma in the U.S., our findings underscore the potential long-term benefits of early-life nutritional support programs for lifelong health.
Given inconsistencies in the literature, we examined the role of relationship quality, past relationship experiences (i.e., prior marital experiences and unmarried cohabitation experiences), and demographic characteristics (i.e., gender and age) in the association between relationship status and health. We analyzed data from the 2010 Married and Cohabiting Couples Study, a cross-sectional survey study conducted in the United States. Data were collected from married and unmarried individuals in cohabiting mixed-gender relationships (N= 2,150). Participants completed self-report measures online. We conductedt-tests, multiple regressions, path analyses, and an ANOVA to test hypotheses. Key findings were that (a) relationship quality had a stronger association with health than relationship status, (b) prior marital experiences and unmarried cohabitation experiences were negatively associated with health, (c) married women significantly reported better health than unmarried women, and (d) married men and unmarried men did not significantly differ in reported health. Descriptive statistics showed that younger adults may perceive their health more positively than older adults regardless of relationship status. Future research should consider historical context, recruitment of diverse participant samples, and more precise operational definitions of health.
Most epidemiological surveys focus on adult gambling behaviors related to traditional gambling forms, while studies on novel forms often focus on loot boxes and cryptocurrency trading individually. This study examines the co-ocurrence of emergent gambling and gambling-like practices, analyzing the demographic and psychological characteristics of involved gamblers. A cross-sectional study surveyed 1429 Spanish individuals aged 18–65, using a web-based questionnaire. The survey assessed participation in 19 gambling (e.g., lotteries, sports betting) and gambling-like activities (e.g., trading of cryptocurrencies and other assets, buying loot-boxes), along with sociodemographic and substance use. Problem gambling (PGSI), Impulsivity (UPPS-P), and cognitive distortions (Labrador’s cognitive distortions scale) were also assessed. Participants who gambled over the past year (n= 921) were classified into four groups: traditional gambling (TG) only (64.5%,n= 594), TG with trading activities (27.5%,n= 253), TG with gambling withing video games or streaming platforms (2.5%,n= 23), and TG with both trading and video gambling (5.5%,n= 51). Most gamblers engaged exclusively in traditional formats, but 35.5% also participated in novel gambling forms. Those involved in both trading and video gambling were generally younger, male, with higher levels of impulsivity and gambling-related cognitive distortions compared to TG-only gamblers (p< 0.001). This group also exhibited higher rates of problem gambling and substance use (p< 0.001). This study emphasize the importance of including emerging gambling activities, which are particularly prevalent among high-risk gamblers, in epidemiological surveys. Identifying new gambling patterns and associated risk factors could help optimize public policies and develop more effective regulatory and prevention strategies.
The existing literature on Internet governance offers important insights on the relationship between state and society in China and the West. It is important to explore this relationship in the developing world. This study focuses on Pakistan, exploring the role of relevant legal frameworks, political authorities, and institutional structures in relation to monitoring and regulating telephone traffic, legal compliance, and consumer interests. By focusing on the interplay between political dynamics, international partnerships, and evolving digital landscapes, this study examines the evolution of Internet governance model in Pakistan. While Pakistan appears on a trajectory to digital authoritarianism, its journey is hampered by structural limitations, resistance from democratic forces, concerns about data protection and privacy, pushback from the judiciary, and the emergence of a vigilant civil society. Challenges in establishing a coherent authoritarian model of Internet governance have resulted in an ad hoc approach. This study offers a nuanced understanding of multifaceted factors influencing Internet governance in a developing country.
Through a longstanding collaboration, psychiatrists and anthropologists have assessed the impact of sociocultural context on mental health and elaborated the concept of culture in psychiatry. However, recent developments in ecological anthropology may have untapped potential for cultural psychiatry. This paper aims to uncover how “ecologies” inform patients’ and clinicians’ experiences, as well as their intersubjective relationships. Drawing on my ethnography with Jerome, a carriage driver who became my patient in a shelter-based psychiatric clinic, and on anthropological work about how psychic life is shaped ecologically, I describe how more-than-human relationality and the affordances of various places—a clinic and a stable—influenced both Jerome’s well-being and my perceptions as a clinician. I also explore how these ecologies shaped our different roles, including my dual roles as psychiatrist and ethnographer. In the discussion, I define ecological factors, describe their implications for clinical practice, and suggest how they could be integrated into DSM’s cultural formulation.
This study aims to quantify the extent to which union formation mediates the relationship between employment uncertainty and the transition to parenthood, taking Italy as a case study. Research on the determinants of low fertility is increasingly shedding light on the negative effects of employment uncertainty. It is generally acknowledged that partnership formation plays a fundamental mediating role, as uncertain employment conditions may hamper the initial formation of a stable union, consequently affecting the likelihood of having a child. Nevertheless, it remains unknown how much of the (total) effect of employment uncertainty on fertility is indeed mediated by union formation. To perform the mediation analysis, we relied on the KHB (Karlson–Holm–Breen) method to accurately assess the effect of employment uncertainty on the transition to parenthood with and without controlling for union formation, i.e. the mediating variable. Results indicate that union formation mediates between 25 and 40% of the negative effect of employment uncertainty on the transition to parenthood, especially among men. Differences by cohort groups are evident, with the youngest cohorts being the most affected by such a mediation. We conclude that union formation is a key element in the relationship between employment uncertainty and fertility as it mediates a non-negligible share of the total effect of employment uncertainty on transition to parenthood.
In recent years, early childhood education for sustainability has received increasing attention. However, research on early childhood teachers in relation to this issue remains marginalized. Teachers’ environmental attitudes support children’s nature play and are strongly associated with sustainability. According to previous studies, environmental knowledge is important to pro-environmental attitudes. This article used a quantitative survey to explore the environmental attitudes of 832 early childhood in-service teachers and determined the relationship between their environmental knowledge and attitudes. The Two Major Environmental Values (2-MEV) scale was adopted to examine the environmental attitudes of the participants, including conservation and utilization. The outcomes showed that the participants had a more positive attitude toward environmental conservation and a less positive attitude toward environmental utilization. Although their environmental knowledge was relatively low, it significantly predicted their environmental attitudes toward both conservation and utilization, but the impacts were minimal. The 2-MEV scale cannot fully resolve controversies regarding the relationship between teachers’ environmental knowledge and attitudes. More attention should be given to other aspects of teachers’ jobs, such as job satisfaction and culture.
Awareness and utilization of health interventions can be influenced by sociodemographic factors. These factors play a role in information processing, particularly regarding health messaging. The aim of this study is to analyze how different sociodemographic factors and gambling behaviors are associated with awareness of a (Swedish) gambling self-exclusion register. The study used data from the Swedish longitudinal gambling study (Swelogs) and analyzed n = 6720 participants from a stratified random sample of the Swedish population aged 18–84 years. Logistic regressions were conducted to analyze associations between sociodemographic characteristics, gambling behavior and awareness. Males with middle (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.32–2.19) and high income (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.19–2.09) and females with high (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.03–1.76) and middle-level education (OR = 1.35, CI = 1.04–1.76), had higher awareness of Spelpaus.se. Online gamblers with problematic gambling behavior were three times (OR = 3.69, 95% CI = 2.15–6.37) more likely to be aware than non-gamblers. Online gamblers born in Sweden were twice (OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.19–3.19) as likely to be aware compared to those born outside of Europe. Males with high level of awareness had higher PGSI scores compared to women. Education could increase awareness of potential health risks and opportunities for intervention, particularly among women. Future interventions should be tailored to cater to the specific needs of individuals with lower levels of awareness, to facilitate enhancing their awareness and ultimately promoting a more equitable utilization of self-exclusion measures.
Research has demonstrated that interest groups frequently align themselves with a specific party and its ideological stance. Still, other studies have underlined that interest groups engage with undecided and opposing factions. In other words, they target friends as well as foes. This raises the question of whether their communication is based on the same type of arguments across the political spectrum of targets or if they customize their messages. Furthermore, what working principles do they use if they adapt their arguments? This exploratory study illuminates how customization is commonplace by leveraging and extending issue ownership theory and empirical data from interviews with 45 lobbyists. Typically, different aspects of a policy issue are highlighted to align with the policy priorities of different political parties. Additionally, the study indicates that organizational type and resource capacity impact the extent and manner of message customization. The research advances our understanding of lobbying strategies, offering new insights into the strategic interactions between interest groups and political parties.
Vietnam, a lower-middle-income nation with a strong patriarchal influence in Southeast Asia, has experienced an increase in intimate partner sexual violence. Despite its ethnic diversity and varying socio-economic status, research addressing ethnic differences in intimate partner sexual abuse within the country remains scarce. This quantitative study utilized the most recent and nationally representative dataset from the Vietnam Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2020–2021 to explore the relationship between women’s educational attainment and sexual coercion by intimate partners, with a focus on ethnic differences in this relationship. The chi-square (χ²) test of independence was used for bivariate statistics, whereas a probit model with probability sampling weights was employed for multivariate analysis. The sample comprises 6,033 women of reproductive age. Findings reveal that women with upper secondary education (p < 0.05) and vocational/university education or higher (p < 0.01) are less likely to experience sexual coercion by intimate partners. Notably, women from Mong ethnicity households, women residing in the North Central, Central Coastal regions, and Central Highlands exhibit the highest likelihood of experiencing this issue (p < 0.01). Given the higher likelihood of intimate partner sexual coercion experienced by women in minority groups such as the Tay/Thai/Muong/Nung and Mong compared to the Kinh and Chinese/Hoa, prioritizing the enhancement of women’s education in these ethnic groups would be a crucial policy response to address this form of intimate partner violence.
We conducted an ethnobotanical study to assess the contribution of agaves to the health and nutrition of inhabitants of two Mixtec communities in Oaxaca, Mexico. Using semi-structured interviews we identified the edible and medicinal uses of agave. We then analysed the contribution and cultural value of agave species using quantitative indices (Use Value, Relative Frequency of Citation, and Cultural Food Significance), as well as the influence of sociodemographic variables on knowledge of agaves.
Recently Sakarya Province of Turkey, with its unique mixed socio-cultural structure has often become home to reported violence cases. The aim of this paper is to identify the effects of economic hardship, football games and COVID-19 curfews on violence against women in Sakarya, between 2021 and 2022. This period covers both the COVID-19 curfews and curfew-free times. Using the novel data obtained from a government agency that aims to combat violence against women, this paper particularly tests the underlying factors behind various types of violence, i.e. sexual, economic, physical, psychological and stalking using a multinomial logit model. Findings suggest that the costs of living crisis during the recent periods contributes to a higher risk of violence against women, especially in populated regions where higher crime and migration rates were observed. Local football events and curfews seem to have increased the incidence of violence. The results highlight larger reported violence cases against women in 2022, that can be attributed to easier access to public authorities and increased media campaigns of governmental agencies. We add to the literature first by examining a novel data from a unique province of Turkey that include official reported violence cases. Second we underline the roles of COVID-19 curfews and local football events which are not widely addressed in literature in addition to a popular reason, i.e. economic hardships. Third, we distinguish violence types of physical, economic, sexual, and psychological violence in addition to stalking, and observe determinants for each type of violence.
Past studies on social exclusion and its impacts on prosocial behaviors and pro-environmental consumption intentions and behaviors yielded mixed results. By applying role identity theory, this study seeks to understand the role of socially excluded consumers in green food product consumption behavior through green identity. The significance of this research is that it seeks to establish the relationship between social exclusion and environmental behavior which is a relatively uncharted subject. Thus, it is important to know this relationship in order to come up with effective environmental policies that will encourage the participation of these socially excluded groups. Furthermore, this study tested the boundary conditions of these relationships by including the pro-environmental attitude as an important moderator. A time-lagged survey of 702 respondents was conducted and data were tested by using covariance-based structural equation modeling. The results revealed that social exclusion significantly predicted green identity. Results further stated that green identity was positively related to green consumption behavior (GCB). Additionally, the relationship between social exclusion was mediated by green identity; moreover, this mediation was moderated by the pro-environmental attitude so that social exclusion exhibits stronger green identities in the presence of the pro-environmental attitude. These findings have significant policy repercussions. By highlighting the potential of environmentalism to empower excluded groups and drive responsible consumption, the study aligns with goals like reducing inequalities (SDG 10) and promoting sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). These findings can be very useful for policymakers in order to define policy measures that are not only related to environmental matters, but also to social inclusion. For example, community-based programs incorporating both environmental education and people’s support could assist in intervention of vulnerable people. It paves the way for initiatives that not only address environmental concerns but also foster social inclusion and build a more sustainable future for all.
The widespread use of the internet has made online shopping an integral part of modern digital life for people. However, the emergence of compulsive online buying in China has further led to psychological distress among residents. Online compulsive buying cannot be considered a homogeneous group. In response, based on the theory of false needs and the empty-self, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted in China with 860 respondents to investigate the population’s online compulsive buying and psychological distress as well as latent profiles. The results of the survey indicated a modest correlation between compulsive buying and psychological distress. Latent profile analysis was employed, and three latent profiles were identified: “low compulsive - low distress”, “high compulsive - low distress”, and “high compulsive - high distress”. The results of the multiple regression analysis showed that the frequency of online shopping, average monthly spending on online shopping, sex and marital status had significant effects on the different latent profiles. This study offers new insights from an interdisciplinary perspective and provides empirical evidence on the typology of online compulsive buying-related psychological distress. We also advocate for a heightened focus on the mental health of residents and a critical reflection on Chinese social policy, particularly in the current context where economic development and the expansion of domestic demand are prioritized.
Cognitive skills, known as executive function (EF), that are critical for school success, are often underdeveloped in children living in low-income and economically marginalized (LIEM) circumstances. Considerable research has shown that EF is trainable; however, effect sizes are modest at best, and training programs are generally delivered either one-on-one for indicated children or universally, requiring high costs and effort. The present study aimed to treat indicated children attending a Title I school in a small-group format, using an intrinsically rewarding game-based protocol developed for kindergarteners with EF difficulties. The intervention occurred 3–4 times per week for ~8 weeks. The pilot program scaffolded children to perform increasingly challenging tasks designed to increase cognitive load and incorporated meta-cognitive components teaching self-regulation. This pilot (N= 14) evidenced that children at a Title I school tolerated the program; (n= 12) 85% of children who started the program completed it through post-testing. Effect sizes of baseline to post-intervention on standardized EF measures show promise for the pilot program. Cohen’sdfor behavioral self-control were 0.70 and 1.36; for a computerized task, Cohen’sd= 0.40; for a conflict resolution task, Cohen’sd= 0.61; and for a classroom observation of behavior, Cohen’sd= 0.39. A standardized teacher rating form of child behavioral control had a Cohen’sd= 0.68. Pilot results suggest that training effects could transfer to the classroom. All effects are longitudinal and within subjects, suggesting that further between-subjects testing is warranted; results should not be generalized without further evaluation of the program.
In the United States, it is estimated that 15% of Latinos will experience a depressive or anxiety disorder during their lifetime. Education, prevention programming, and health interventions around topics such as stress, nutrition, mental health, and health maintenance for Latino immigrants are lacking, inadequate, or nonexistent. This type of programming may be protective against depression and anxiety. A total of 19 Latina women completed a five-week, group-based intervention to learn about stress, stress management, nutrition, mental health, and healthy behaviors in a culturally sensitive environment taught by native Spanish speakers. Program evaluation occurred through in-depth interviews and changes in anxiety and depression scores via the Generalized Anxiety Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively. The team saw statistically significant decreases in the GAD-7 scores pre- and post-intervention (8.00 versus 5.08,p<0.05), but no differences in the PSS or the PHQ-2 scores. Group-based intervention and education taught by native Spanish speakers may be an acceptable and feasible approach to addressing anxiety in Latina immigrants.
We developed a six-item Compact Acculturation Scale (CAS) based on common items on comprehensive acculturation scales and examined it with two designs using data from the Finnish Annual Youth Future Report Survey of 2023 (N= 744 immigrant-origin youth, IOY). In Study 1, we first confirmed second-order factorial structure of CAS and its convergent validity. Second, using structural equation modelling, we found that the relation of acculturation with self-esteem was ambivalent among recently migrated youth who perceived discrimination. Established immigrant-origin youth who reported discrimination were more likely to prefer an ethnic orientation. In Study 2, we examined acculturation profiles among immigrant-origin youth based on CAS variables, and the relationship of profiles with self-esteem, perceived discrimination, and sense of belonging. Six profiles were found:Medium integration(49%),High integration(22%),Neo-culture kid(15%),Separation(6%),Assimilation(6%), andMarginalized(2%). Both integration profiles were associated with high self-esteem and sense of belonging. Third largest profile was characterized by rejecting both host and heritage cultures, but unlikeMarginalized, they reported enjoying both in-group and host-peer relations. In sum, this study shows that CAS is a reliable and robust instrument that can serve us in investigating acculturation both by variable- and person-oriented approaches.
Scholars have demonstrated that art has been effectively mobilized for political action and plays a significant role in civil life. But does this hold true when examining popular culture icons instead of high aesthetic objects? Sociological work has heretofore been largely silent on popular culture’s place in iconicity and aesthetics. Situated in a strong cultural perspective, this article examines the creation of Simon Baz, a new DC Comics superhero, and in doing so adds a layer of complexity to existing literature on aesthetics and civil society. It argues that iconic shifts in popular culture impact civil discourse similarly to other forms of iconic disruptions and aesthetic public discourses. I bring nuance to this dialogue by considering layers of the aesthetic public—specialty news media and fan forum discussions. I show that the creation of Simon Baz stimulated discourse at all three levels: mainstream civil discourse, specialty media, and fan forums. I further show that the discourse is nuanced at each level, and the relationship between layers is multifaceted. I ultimately identify two different responses and demonstrate their application:symbolic appreciationandaesthetic criticism.This approach foregrounds popular culture and has strong implications for the structure of cultural power in society.
The aim of this study was to explore the use of in-between spaces to create music environments in a preschool setting. The research method was a 1.5-year case study of a preschool in northern Taiwan, focusing on innovative music environment creation in the in-between space. The implementation process was divided into three stages: exploration, development, and maturity. Children were free to interact with the environment during school hours. Data were gathered through observations, interviews with children, teachers, and the principal, as well as a review of parent-teacher communication books and children’s works. The findings indicated that the in-between space not only had a great impact on children’s development but also enhanced their aesthetic experiences, effectively achieving educational goals. Proper utilization of in between in preschools has the potential to create substantial added value. Designing music environments that leverage their unique characteristics can establish an adaptive and engaging music learning environment for children. This allowed children to unleash their creativity and cultivate habits of independent learning through free play. However, a successful music environment required systematic planning and execution, setting goals in stages, and guiding children through a gradual music experience.
Research on intervention development has expanded over the past decade. However, much of the extant literature on complex intervention development is confined to healthcare and public health broadly or intervention science specifically with scant attention to the process within other fields known for their extensive provision of social interventions such as social work or community-based services. This paper aims to advance understanding of the complex intervention development process within social work using an example from the Swedish municipal social services. We use the Guidance for Reporting Intervention Development Studies (GUIDED) to describe the development and content of My Choice-My Way! an intervention to support youth transitioning from out-of-home care. Youth in out-of-home care is an extremely vulnerable group and one of social welfare services’ core user populations. Coproduction processes were used to develop a theory-, evidence-, and implementation-based approach to intervention development. Implications for future development within social work are discussed.
It is often unclear what leads to long term success for young adults that spent time in foster care. In this study we examined individual and systemic factors, including time in foster care, involvement in leadership programs, and health insurance coverage, seeking their impact on flourishing. Drawing on a national sample of 379 young adults that spent time in foster care, the survey examined individual and systemic factors that could increase flourishing in early adulthood. Study results reveal that Transitional Age Youth (TAY) who spent time in foster care experience significantly less flourishing compared to the general population (t =  − 12.85, df = 337, p < 0.001). Additionally, sexual and gender minority youth within the foster care system report lower levels of flourishing than their heterosexual peers (t(336) = 13.1, p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis indicates that flourishing is negatively impacted by race, with African American TAY experiencing significantly lower flourishing (β =  − 0.52, p < 0.01), and by sexual orientation, with sexual minority youth also reporting reduced flourishing (β =  − 2.26, p < 0.001). Moreover, the length of time in foster care, particularly for those who spent 16–18 years in care, was associated with decreased flourishing (β =  − 1.65, p < 0.01). Health insurance emerged as the only positive factor, significantly enhancing flourishing outcomes (β = 1.41, p < 0.001). This study contributes to a better understanding of disparities for marginalized populations, emphasizing the critical role of access to healthcare services in promoting flourishing among vulnerable young adults.
IntroductionThe United States is the only high-income country without a comprehensive national maternity leave policy guaranteeing paid, job-projected leave. The current study examined associations between maternity leave characteristics (duration of leave, payment status of leave) and postpartum depressive symptoms.MethodsThis study used a sample of 3,515 postpartum women from the New York City and New York State Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) from 2016 to 2019. We used logistic regression to examine the association of leave duration and payment status with self-reported postpartum depressive symptoms between 2 and 6 months postpartum.ResultsCompared to having at least some paid leave, having unpaid leave was associated with an increased odds of postpartum depressive symptoms, adjusting for leave duration and selected covariates (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04–1.93). There was no significant difference in postpartum depressive symptoms between those with partially and those with fully paid leave. In contrast to prior literature, leave duration was not significantly associated with postpartum depressive symptoms (aOR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97–1.02 for each additional week of leave).DiscussionThis study suggests that unpaid leave is associated with increased risk of postpartum depression, which can have long-term health effects for both mothers and children. Future studies can help to identify which communities could most benefit from paid leave and help to inform paid leave policies.
The measurement of poverty using the material deprivation scale has become widespread throughout the world. One of the technical challenges in constructing the material deprivation scale is the identification of socially perceived necessities. Researchers have used methods ranging from focus groups to separate public opinion surveys to develop a list of socially perceived necessities. However, material deprivation is a relative concept. As society undergoes economic, demographic and political change, the list needs to be reviewed for relevance. The aim of this study was to examine the stability of perceptions of children's necessities in Japan at a time when public awareness of child poverty in Japan has risen sharply. The results of the analysis show that, using the 50% criterion, the list of socially perceived necessities for children has been surprisingly stable over 20 years. However, there has been a statistically significant change in the public's perception of necessity for 16 of the 25 items, even after controlling for age, gender, income and whether they have children. Furthermore, the analysis shows that although the consensus between genders and between income quintile groups is fairly stable or converging, there is a greater divergence in the consensus between age groups and between respondents with and without children. In a society with increasing numbers of elderly and childless people, we need to be increasingly careful that the items selected for the deprivation scale not only meet the 50% criteria, but are also agreed by different segments of the population.
Advances in end-of-life technologies increasingly destabilize received notions of personhood, identity, and ethics. As notions of personhood and identity within such systems are made to conform to discrete, binary and less fluid categories, some in the West have sought guidance in the techniques and views related to the dying process cultivated in other cultures, particularly Tibetan Buddhism. This article considers such dynamics as they unfolded in research focused on the postmortem bodies of Tibetan Buddhist practitioners in India. This article introduces the termthanato-technicsto highlight the temporalities, imaginary or otherwise, evoked, enabled, and invested through the use of technologies to ascertain or conjecture about the intrasubjectivity of the dead and dying.
Understanding local worldviews is a challenge during clinical encounters, especially when they involve cultural references without acceptance from the medical community. Gangstalking is a Western cultural notion which refers to systematic harassment, surveillance, and torture from unseen or covert assailants or networks. It is not a ‘real phenomenon’ compared with genuine stalking, but experients report worse depression, post-traumatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, and longer lasting encounters. They report physical pain and impossible feats of espionage technologically orchestrated by unknown malevolent actors. Using conversational data from targeted individual podcasts, I explore gangstalking as a cultural concept of distress (CCD) by highlighting associated explanations, idioms, and symptoms. Clinically, gangstalking is likely diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia. However, its association with frightening events parallels Susto and Nervios. Physical symptoms parallel Open Mole and Brain Fag Syndrome. Like many CCDs, gangstalking is a multi-dimensional phenomenon not neatly mapped onto psychiatric categories. Misinterpreting gangstalking cases as unique or isolated is a likely outcome even when they fit within a well-known Western subculture and techno-science belief system. Moving past prior, outdated notions of folk illnesses and culture-bound syndromes, gangstalking as a CCD helps end the assumption that only the other has exotic or non-psychiatric categories of distress.
Does the media enhance issue accountability? Many argue it does by covering where politicians stand on policy. However, evidence of this process is limited and fails to address two alternatives. First, when informed about an issue by the media, people may change their own issue stance so it aligns with a politician they already support. Second, the public may ignore the news when it conflicts with party loyalty. We distinguish these alternatives using survey experiments and observational studies of local media and the public’s use of issues to evaluate their members of Congress from 2006 to 2022. Across these settings local news increases the public’s reliance on policy to evaluate politicians, affirming the media’s contribution to issue accountability despite heightened polarization. These studies also highlight a mechanism behind this, showing news primarily changes views of legislators by reducing widespread uncertainty about their policy positions.
This study explores the embodied experiences of pre-licensed marriage and family therapists (MFTs) during in-session instances of client trauma disclosure through poetical analysis. Informed by Karen Barad’s agential realism, interviews with novice MFTs (N = 11) were examined, considering evocative moments or moments of “aliveness” where the material-discursive body of the therapist was impacted by disclosure. Poetical analyses highlighted how pre-licensed MFTs embody and experience disclosure physiologically, emotionally, cognitively, and relationally, underscoring the layered ways in which therapists respond to client trauma. Eleven poems depict the embodied experience of trauma disclosure, based on the researcher’s hearing of MFTs’ experiences of client trauma disclosure. Understanding the multiplicative experiences of therapists during trauma disclosure may aid in normalizing the breadth of responses that come with relationally engaging with and holding space for trauma-affected clients and serve as an introduction to the varied and evocative experiences of trauma disclosure for therapists in training.
This study examined various formats and strategies used by caregivers in early reading activities, and assessed how they were tailored to the developmental stages of infants and toddlers. Participants included three caregivers from classrooms for ages 0–12, 13–18, and 19–24 months, and the director of an early childhood education center known for emphasizing early reading experiences. Data were collected from observations of reading activities and interviews with the four participants. The findings revealed that the caregivers intentionally organized reading activities in different formats— one-on-one, group, and free reading—each fulfilling distinct objectives and developmental needs. They employed various strategies, including contextualized linguistic, paralinguistic, social, and decontextualized linguistic approaches, which were all adapted to the children’s developmental levels and reading contexts. This study resulted in a scaffolding framework that informs reading practices in early childhood education centers, offering professional training recommendations and particularly highlighting the necessity of decontextualized talk beyond the book text.
Once fertility falls to a low level, the number of births declines, affecting the future of population growth and age structure. In low-fertility settings where sex preference is culturally rooted in society, the sex ratio at birth is usually higher than the normal average leading to an imbalanced age structure in the long run. Low fertility and its negative consequences have led to the implementation of pronatalist programs aimed at increasing fertility rates in Iran. In this context, the number of births and sex ratio at birth are matters of concern for policymakers. The main objective of this paper is to forecast the trends of the total number of births by gender and predict the sex ratio at birth (SRB) in Iran over 10 years (2021–2030) using two modeling approaches: Deep Neural Networks-DNNs and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average—ARIMA. The results are compared to examine the performance of these forecasting methods. The findings from both DNN and ARIMA approaches suggest a 20.6% and 3.5% reduction in the number of births, respectively, and a changing trend within the normal range for sex ratios at birth. The results show the superiority of DNN model as compared with ARIMA for predictions. We recommend the utilization of the DNN approach and its derivations to visualize the outcomes of population policies based on accurate and long-term predictions. This approach can serve as an initial validation of policy impacts to enhance policymakers’ confidence in their proposed programs.
Being competitive in ferocious market conditions which remains a challenge for Family Businesses. These firms operate with acutely limited resources and hence need to develop their innovation capability to address the belligerent market requirements. For the Family Businesses of the developing country, the incorporation of sustainability depends upon a number of factors. Therefore, the current study identifies factors that have the potential to derive the Sustainable Oriented Innovation Capability for enhancing the firm competitiveness. Based on the data of 347 respondents, the application of Structural Equation Modelling reported that Strategic Planning, Knowledge Management, Leadership Management, and Customer Pressure are the forces that can derive the organizations’ Sustainable Oriented Innovation Capability, which has further been reported to enhance the firm competitiveness. Despite the theoretical importance, governmental support is reported to have negligible effects, which makes the context of the developing country more interesting. Based on the findings, a thorough alignment and a revisit of the organizational internal strategic infrastructure are recommended. In contrast, governmental institutions are urged to facilitate Family Businesses in accordance with their potential contribution to the national domestic product.
Screening measures are increasingly being recommended to identify children who have experienced adversity, as these experiences are associated with a range of health concerns. However, concerns have been raised that many of these measures are not feasible to use in settings where time is limited or do not have empirical support. Even among screening measures with empirical support deemed to be feasible, there remain significant differences in how adversity is operationalized. This review aimed to identify brief adversity screening measures with psychometric information available and to describe how adversity was operationalized across these measures. Studies were located through eight academic databases, grey literature, and through forward and backwards searching of the reference lists of included studies. Screening, full text review, and data extraction were completed independently by two authors. In total, 42 studies describing 41 measures were located. The most commonly assessed form of adversity was bullying. Additional forms of adversity assessed for included violence exposure, racial and ethnic discrimination, abuse, multiple forms of adversity, childbirth, neglect, and poverty. Though multiple measures have been developed to assess the same form of adversity, measures assessing a common adversity type frequently contained similar items. Currently, many brief child-completed adversity screening measures exist for bullying. More research is needed to develop brief screening measures for other forms of adversity, to screen for multiple types of adversity at once, or to provide empirical support for existing measures.
Internet development has changed working patterns and career content, helped facilitate information and knowledge flow, and presented great potential value in improving job quality. The existing literature tends to study subjective or objective job quality individually and lacks attention to special youth groups and the influence of internet development on job quality. This study aims to examine the impact of internet development on youth job quality and the transmission channels of this impact. Job quality is a series of subjective and objective job characteristics that increase employee welfare. First, to deeply measure the material and emotional utility obtained by young people from work, we develop a subjective and objective job quality index containing five dimensions and use the entropy weight method to measure the youth job quality index. Second, we employ panel data from the China Family Panel Studies from 2016 to 2020, introduce a fixed effects model to verify the hypotheses, and confirm the robustness of the results by adopting many methods and techniques. We find that youth job quality is generally poor and presents a polarisation phenomenon. The empirical results indicate that internet development significantly improves youth job quality. From the single dimension of youth job quality, internet development has a significant positive effect on wage income, welfare treatment, job stability, job satisfaction and social security and reduces work intensity. The mechanism analysis shows that the positive effect of internet development on job quality is achieved by promoting information symmetry and improving the working ability of young people. Notably, the job quality-enhancing effect of internet development varies according to the employer type, household registration and age. This study complements the relevant literature and theory on internet development and youth job quality and provides research-based insights and references for formulating effective measures to promote the use of the internet and improve the job quality of youth.
Extant literature shows that well-being is one of the key drivers of attitudes towards migrants as well as preferences for asylum and refugee policies. Less in is known, however, about the relationship between well-being and attitudes towards migrants during sudden micro-level events that may elicit the sense of existential threat. To investigate the underpinnings of these relationships, two studies on samples of 600 Slovaks each were conducted before the Russian invasion of Ukraine and during its initial phase. The results show that well-being had a stable positive relationship with attitudes towards migrants across the studies, albeit not with preferences for asylum and refugee policies. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the negative feelings elicited by the war predicted preferences for asylum and refugee policies beyond well-being. The results indicate that incorporating psychological factors, such as emotional responses to the looming threat of war, may considerably inform the debate surrounding the support for inclusive asylum and refugee policies.
We investigated the associations between sociodemographic factors, religiosity traits, and the perception of discrimination among Muslim Americans in both everyday life and medical settings. A self-administered web-based questionnaire, comprising validated measures of discrimination and religiosity, was completed by a convenience sample of English-speaking adult Muslim Americans, recruited through both in-person and online channels. Among the 1281 respondents, less than half were born in the USA (46%), and a significant portion displayed visible religious markers, such as wearing a hijab or having a beard (61%). Only 154 (12%) reported never experiencing everyday discrimination, while 358 (28%) reported not experiencing discrimination in medical settings. In a multivariable linear regression model, greater perceived everyday discrimination (β = 1.053,p< 0.01) was positively associated with greater discrimination in medical settings. Participants more comfortable self-identifying as Muslim in hospital settings (β = -0.395,p< 0.05) were less likely to perceive healthcare discrimination. Those visibly expressing their religiosity (β = 0.779,p< 0.01) and those with greater intrinsic religiosity (β = 0.231,p< 0.05) were more likely to encounter everyday discrimination. Conversely, older participants (β = -0.015,p< 0.05), adult immigrants to the US (β = -0.375,p< 0.05), those in better health (β = -0.157,p< 0.05), and those more comfortable identifying as Muslim (β = -0.305,p< 0.05) had lower perceptions of everyday discrimination. This study underscores the significance of the relationship between religiosity characteristics and experiences of both hospital and everyday discrimination for Muslim Americans.
BackgroundMyalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is associated with long-term disability and poor quality of life (QoL). Cardinal ME/CFS symptoms (including post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction and sleep disturbances) have been observed in Post COVID-19 Condition (PCC). To gain further insight into the potential role of ME/CFS as a post-COVID-19 sequela, this study investigates associations between symptoms and patient-reported outcomes, as well as symptom clusters.MethodsParticipants included Australian residents aged between 18 and 65 years formally diagnosed with ME/CFS fulfilling the Canadian or International Consensus Criteria or PCC meeting the World Health Organization case definition. Validated, self-administered questionnaires collected participants’ sociodemographic and illness characteristics, symptoms, QoL and functional capacity. Associations between symptoms and patient-reported outcomes were investigated with multivariate linear regression models. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to identify symptom clusters.ResultsMost people with ME/CFS (pwME/CFS) and people with PCC (pwPCC) were female (n= 48/60, 80.0% andn= 19/30, 63.3%, respectively;p= 0.12). PwME/CFS were significantly younger (x̄=41.75,s= 12.91 years) than pwPCC (x̄=48.13,s=10.05 years;p=0.017). Autonomic symptoms (notably dyspnoea) were associated with poorer scores in most patient-reported outcome domains for both cohorts. None of the four symptom clusters identified were unique to ME/CFS or PCC. Clusters were largely delineated by the presence of gastrointestinal and neurosensory symptoms, illness duration, ME/CFS criteria met and total symptoms.ConclusionsIllness duration may explain differences in symptom burden between pwME/CFS and pwPCC. PCC diagnostic criteria must be refined to distinguish pwPCC at risk of long-term ME/CFS-like illness and subsequently deliver necessary care and support.
The “urban wellbeing paradox” is a recurring theme in research examining the differences in life satisfaction across settlements of varying sizes, suggesting that large cities are consistently associated with higher levels of dissatisfaction due to disproportionately high interpersonal income inequalities. This paper re-evaluates that conclusion by analysing the relationship between individual dissatisfaction, conditions of personal disadvantage, and income inequality in large cities. Our extensive study, based on self-reported dissatisfaction from over 760,000 citizens living in EU and UK NUTS2 regions between 2013 and 2018, reveals that individuals facing occupational and economic disadvantages are the most negatively affected by living in urban areas. However, urbanization economies partially offset these negative effects, particularly for those individuals in disadvantaged conditions.
As the anti-poverty process is dynamic and stochastic and low-income communities are vulnerable to various shocks and stressors, scholars have rapidly embraced the concept of resilience. Motivated by the fact that China has achieved significant progress in eliminating absolute poverty and has quickly developed digital financial inclusion (DFI), utilizing data from the China Household Finance Survey for 2013–2019 and Peking University’s DFI data, this study measures the poverty-alleviation resilience (PAR) of rural Chinese households (split into poverty-eradication and development resilience) and thoroughly analyzes the influence of DFI on PAR. The study finds that (1) DFI improves poverty-eradication and development resilience, and the impact of DFI on development resilience is higher than that of poverty-eradication resilience. This suggests that rural households effectively utilize DFI to improve resilience after escaping poverty. (2) DFI affects the PAR by improving financial literacy, easing credit constraints, and enhancing risk-coping capacities. (3) DFI positively influences PAR for rural households that do not receive pro-poor transfer income, while the impact of DFI on PAR of households who receive pro-poor transfer income is insignificant. Moreover, regional heterogeneity in the impact exists across regions.
The uncertainty of economic policy reflects changes in the macroeconomic environment, which can have extensive and profound impacts on the economy and society. However, existing studies have paid little attention to the influence of economic policy uncertainty on household micro-behavior. This paper empirically examines the impact of economic policy uncertainty on household financial vulnerability using household micro-data and an economic policy uncertainty index. The results indicate that increasing economic policy uncertainty significantly heightens household financial vulnerability. Further analysis reveals that heightened economic policy uncertainty leads to a decrease in household income. While it does not have a significant impact on household consumption, it does result in imbalances between household income and expenditure, as well as an increase in household debt burdens, ultimately exacerbating financial vulnerability. Heterogeneity analysis shows that economic policy uncertainty plays a more significant role in promoting financial vulnerability among households with low physical capital, rural areas and central and western regions. This study offers valuable policy insights for relevant departments to mitigate household financial vulnerability and uphold economic policy stability.

This study aimed to examine the relationships among parental achievement pressure, adolescent-parent relationships, academic stress, insomnia, and life satisfaction in high-achieving students. Data were collected from 327 science high school students (162 females [49.5%], 165 males [50.5%]) aged between 14 and 18 years old (Mean = 15.98, SD = 1.22). Structural Equation Modeling was used to analyze the data. Parental achievement pressure predicted academic stress and adolescent-parent relationships; academic stress predicted insomnia; both insomnia and adolescent-parent relationships predicted life satisfaction. Academic stress and insomnia had multiple mediator roles between parental achievement pressure and life satisfaction. Adolescent-parent relationships had a mediating role between parental achievement pressure and life satisfaction. Regarding indirect relationships between the variables, it was found that parental achievement pressure could predict life satisfaction through academic stress, insomnia, and adolescent-parent relationships. Variables explained approximately 42% of the total variance regarding life satisfaction. The findings suggest complex relationships among parental achievement pressure, adolescent-parent relationships, academic stress, insomnia, and life satisfaction in high-achieving students. These results highlight the importance of addressing parental achievement pressure, academic stress, and insomnia to improve life satisfaction among high-achieving students.
PurposeAs patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly used in clinical practice for screening, monitoring, and management, the potential for response bias has been raised (e.g., over-reporting problems for attention, under-reporting to avoid treatment changes/discontinuation). We investigated whether patients systematically bias their responses when they know clinicians will review their PROM results.MethodsWe conducted secondary analyses of three experimental studies evaluating PROMs in adult and pediatric care. Prior to PROM completion, intervention group patients were informed that the results would be shown to their clinicians (“feedback” arm), whereas control group patients were told that their clinicians would not see their responses (“no feedback” arm). Independent samplet-tests compared the “feedback” and “no feedback” arms’ PROM scores at baseline. Effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Cohen’sdstatistics with Hedges’gcorrection, and effect sizes > 0.50 were considered clinically relevant.ResultsAcross the 29 domains assessed in the three studies, no between-arm differences reached an effect size of ± 0.50. Only 3/29 effect sizes exceeded ± 0.30. The confidence intervals for 14 domains included ± 0.50, with 4 favoring the “no feedback” arm and 10 favoring the “feedback” arm. Two domains reached statistical significance, one favoring the “no feedback” arm and one favoring the “feedback” arm.ConclusionThis study does not support the hypothesis that patients systematically bias their PROM responses if they know that clinicians will see their results. These findings support using PROMs in clinical practice as a valid mechanism to promote patient-centered care.
Engaging with the significant increase in (post-)apocalyptic stories and representations in science fiction, this contribution aims at showing why a critical reconsideration of this type of cultural expression is essential to deal with this apparent pessimism and how its contents may be productive for future-oriented social and political thought. The reflexive resources present in these fictions are often overlooked for critical uses. To bring them to light, using a primarily literary and cinematic corpus, the analysis will first identify the predominant visions that are presented and characterize the symbolic contents they assemble. By reflecting on the forms of sense-making that are conveyed, it will then distinguish the functions they can perform. Finally, by considering that maintaining the powers to act is what is important in these (post-)apocalyptic situations, the argument will lead to an analysis of how these powers to act are deployed and the reactions and actions that may be thus inspired for an era of ecological crisis.
The study tests the effect of poverty-reduction intervention on family functioning reported by AIDS-orphaned children in extended families in Southern Uganda by asking two questions: (1) based on children’s reports, how does poverty reduction intervention affect family functioning? and (2) to what extent do these effects vary by a child’s gender and orphanhood status? Informed by the social causation theory, family stress model, and asset theory, the study aims to address the existing knowledge gap on effects of poverty reduction interventions on family functioning in low-income families caring for AIDS orphaned children in Uganda. We ran multilevel regression models using longitudinal data collected in a cluster-randomized controlled trial from N = 1410 children (n = 621 boys and n = 789 girls) recruited from 48 rural primary schools in Uganda. Survey data was collected every 12 months over the course of 5 years. The average age of children at enrollment was 13 years. We found significant positive effects of the intervention on family cohesion, family communication, and child-caregiver relationship. Effects vary by child’s gender and orphanhood category. Intervention improves family communication for boys, while improving family cohesion and quality of child-caregiver relationship for girls. Single maternal orphans reported improved family communication, while single paternal orphans reported improved child-caregiver relationship. Poverty reduction interventions are important to improve family functioning for low-income families. Variations by child’s gender and orphanhood status have not been reported in previous studies, and our findings underscore the importance of continued research in this area.
Concealment, or the deliberate withholding of information from others, is of fundamental sociological interest. Yet, a general theoretical framework of concealment is missing from the sociological canon. This paper specifies a model that builds on and goes beyond existing accounts of concealment by emphasizing the desire for autonomy. I propose that the desire for autonomy, and the subjective assessment of concealment as the best route to achieve autonomy, lead individuals to attempt concealment. After specifying a dyadic model based on the concealer (ego) and the target of concealment (alter), I incorporate ego-alter power differentials, network dynamics, and norms about privacy and concealment into a multilevel model of how concealment is initiated and maintained.
Direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTCGT) has the potential to significantly impact racial and ethnic identities as well as social concepts of race and ethnicity. Prior literature challenges the binary choice of essentialism vs. constructionism in understanding consumers’ interpretations of genetic ancestry results. Largely focusing on differences by race and ethnicity, this research finds that test takers selectively apply genetically determinist logic depending on their prior identities and interests. We extend this line of inquiry using in-depth interviews with thirty-six mostly white participants who had previously taken a DTCGT offering combined health and ancestry results, which provided an opportunity to explore how different motivations for testing – e.g., for health or ancestry information – impact interpretations of ancestry results. Our analysis reveals distinct patterns in how health- vs. ancestry-motivated consumers invoke genetic determinism in their interpretations of DTCGT results. At the same time, regardless of motivation for testing, we found little use of genetic results to challenge the coherence or biological basis of racial or ethnic categories. Our results suggest that even if genetic determinism is only selectively applied, and in ways that vary between consumers with different motivations for testing, at least among whites, discourses of genetics as “truth” and white normativity are nonetheless the prevailing interpretive frameworks for genetic ancestry results.
Spiritual formation has historically been considered an important part of theological education for seminary students. Empirical research in this area has grown over the past 15 years; however, this research has been almost exclusively in Christian contexts. As the demands on clergy become increasingly challenging, it is necessary to understand spiritual formation processes among emerging religious leaders across diverse traditions. We build on a growing body of research by offering a brief comparative analysis of prior research related to spiritual formation in Christian and Jewish seminaries. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we analyzed 36 student perspectives on spiritual formation at a Jewish pluralistic seminary in the United States. Students described formation processes occurring in three contexts: (a) on-campus seminary-sponsored activities (e.g.,t’filah/prayer); (b) off-campus seminary-sponsored experiences (e.g., clinical pastoral education); and (c) non-seminary-sponsored resources (e.g., psychotherapy). We center the uniquely Jewish aspects of students’ requests for more training in areas such as practical rabbinics and social justice (i.e.,tikkun olam, repairing the world), relational growth and virtue development (i.e.,middot, character development), and spiritual reflection and restorative practices (i.e.,Shabbatobservance), while also connecting these findings to larger trends in Christian seminary education. Future research directions and implications for Jewish seminary training are considered, drawing upon interdisciplinary relational spirituality frameworks.
Gambling is becoming increasingly frequent among the French population, which has led to an increased number of individuals exhibiting problematic gambling patterns. Studies have found links between narcissism and cognitive distortions in relation to problem gambling, specifically among strategic gamblers, but none has tested perceived personal luck as one type of cognitive distortion in this regard. This study’s purpose was to explore the relationship between narcissism, perceived personal luck and problem gambling among strategic gamblers, and to test for the mediating role of perceived personal luck in the relationship between narcissism and problem gambling. A total of 88 regular strategic gamblers were included (mean age = 37.8), with 49 non-problematic gamblers and 39 problematic gamblers. Participants completed the Problematic Gambling Severity Index, the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, and the Personal Luck Usage Scale. Results showed a significant relationship between narcissism and problem gambling, but no significant link between perceived personal luck and problem gambling and no significant mediation effect of perceived personal luck. These results may indicate a strong perception of personal skills compared to a weak perception of personal luck among problem gamblers of strategic games. This study emphasizes the importance of addressing types of gambling and types of cognitive distortions when investigating problem gambling.
In 1938, Congress enacted the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) as a tool to identify and potentially combat Nazi propaganda. In the 1960s, FARA was amended to shift its focus from capturing propaganda to documenting the advocacy relationship between foreign principals (e.g., governments, political parties, and corporations) and the US government. Today, foreign agents—those hired by foreign principals to represent their interests—are required to register with the Department of Justice unless they meet one of the eight statutory exemptions, including one that allows for the registration under the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA), a 1995 law that requires lobbyists to register with Congress. This paper provides background on FARA, LDA, and how they interact. Using data from both laws, three logit regression models test the importance of American foreign assistances and international alliance connections on a countries decision to hire an advocate in the USA. The analysis demonstrates that countries that receive have more international alliance connections with the USA are more likely to hire a foreign agent, lobbyist, or both. Those that receive more foreign assistance are more likely to hire a lobbyist or a lobbyist and a foreign agent.
This study focuses on housing inequalities across diverse social groups with respect to two housing indicators: subjective housing discrimination; and objective housing deprivation. By scrutinizing the correspondence in inequalities between the two indicators, we enhance the measurement of housing inequality and at the same time we shed light on the relationship between subjective and objective dimensions of housing— a relationship that has received little empirical examination so far. Existing research suggests that housing discrimination can contribute to housing deprivation through two channels: inadequate information and limited economic resources. Our focus is the post-2008 housing market crash era in Ireland. We use two separate large-scale individual-level surveys, the QNHS (2004, 2010, 2014) for analysing housing discrimination and SILC (2014, 2015) for analysing housing deprivation. Our findings reveal a robust convergence between perceptions of housing discrimination and objective housing deprivation across various social groups. Traditionally vulnerable groups—such as young individuals, those with disabilities, non-natives (excluding EU citizenship holders), single parents, and individuals without children—experience both discrimination and deprivation. Notably, certain groups exhibit persistent disparities in discrimination and disadvantage, even after considering factors like human capital, regional and tenure differences.
This paper explores the transformative journey of a start-up company in the energy sector, employing a Dual Organisation-Development (OD) Process, as conceptualised within the co-generative learning/organisation development (OD) model. Originating from a doctoral thesis, this research unveils the application of the dual OD process in a longitudinal study of a start-up’s pursuit to revolutionise the Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) market through digitalisation. The company aimed to connect energy users directly with renewable energy producers, ensuring transparency and traceability of the renewable origin of energy. Initiated through the “DIgitalised Node-trading for renewable energy with GO (DINGO)” project, the start-up received funding from a Norwegian research fund called Oslofjordfondet, propelling the development of a digitalised platform and the underlying research. This paper documents the dynamic interplay between daily business operations and the DINGO project, presenting the dual OD process as a bridged, facilitated intraorganisational and interorganisational development mechanism. Grounded in participatory organisation development and the cogenerative learning model, the study draws on historical written sources and insider perspectives. The research unfolds three key dimensions of the dual OD process within the start-up. Firstly, the research-based innovation project itself serves as a continuous learning and maturing process, reshaping the company over time. Secondly, the project opens avenues for accessing crucial financial, technological, and human resources, fostering new interorganisational collaborations. Thirdly, the project introduces friction between the research project and daily business operations, propelling the business model into unforeseen pathways, resulting in intraorganisational changes. To enhance the depth of the study, a reflection dialogue with the project owner were conducted in the spring 2024, offering a hindsight reflection on the effectiveness of the dual OD process in enhancing project outcomes and its continued application within the company. The paper contributes to understanding the pivotal role of research in early-stage business development, introducing the dual OD process as a valuable model for comprehending the intricate interaction between daily business operations, business modelling, and research projects. It also pays homage to Professor Morten Levin, highlighting the enduring influence of his mentorship and the co-generative learning model. In addition, entrepreneurs can derive practical insights from the dual OD model, providing a framework for navigating the challenges and opportunities inherent in combining business modelling and research, thereby facilitating successful business development.
Significant socioeconomic changes in Hong Kong have coincided with a conspicuous knowledge gap regarding the impact of disparities on family well-being, family communication quality, and personal happiness. To examine changes on family well-being, family communication quality, and personal happiness before, during, and after the 2019 social unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. Five repeated territory-wide cross-sectional surveys were conducted from 2016 to 2023, using telephone and online surveys on 27,074 adults in Hong Kong. Respondents rated their family health, happiness, harmony (family 3Hs), family communication quality, and personal happiness on scales of 0–10. Family well-being was the sum of family 3Hs divided by three (0–10). Trends by socioeconomic factors were analysed using linear prediction and multiple linear regression, weighted for sex and age. Highest scores for all outcomes were observed in 2016 and 2017, followed by a noticeable decline in 2020 and 2021, with the lowest scores recorded in 2023 except for personal happiness with its lowest score recorded in 2021. The decline since 2021 was most noticeable with low monthly household income (predicted margins in 2023 ranged from 5.55 to 6.46 for ≤ HK$19,999; 5.62 to 6.51 for HK$20,000–39,999; 5.81 to 6.78 for ≥ HK$40,000), but no differences were observed by education level. Female, older age, and higher monthly household income were significantly associated with higher family well-being, family communication quality, and personal happiness (allP< 0.001). Higher education level was only significantly associated with personal happiness (P= 0.008). We have first shown socioeconomic disparities in the declining family well-being, family communication quality, and personal happiness from 2016 to 2023 in Hong Kong. These alarming findings require targeted interventions and policies aimed at addressing these disparities and improving wellbeing in the population.
Nomadic pastoralism is still practiced by around one-third of the Mongolian population. Recent socio-economic constraints have challenged pastoral livelihoods and rising livestock numbers threaten overall rangeland health and biodiversity conservation. In the Mongolian Gobi, herder households fully depend on livestock production but little is known about their livelihood trends and potential compatibility with protected area goals. We combined interview data in the Great Gobi B strictly protected area (SPA) with secondary data on regional and national herder households to determine the importance of social networks, willingness to continue a herding lifestyle, and degree of involvement in protected area (PA) management. Our descriptive data confirm that herding is no longer centred on a subsistence lifestyle but rather around cashmere production. Contrary to sustainability goals, especially in protected areas, herder households continue to increase livestock numbers in response to high expenditures in the economic reality of a market economy. We conclude that herders in the Great Gobi B SPA are reaching neither socio-economically nor ecologically sustainable livestock numbers which challenge herders’ livelihoods and PA management alike. We recommend enhancing communication between the PA management and the herding community and increasing participatory conservation activities. National strategies are needed to resolve the current dilemma of increasing livestock numbers to meet livelihood demands and the growing threat to rangeland health.
We advance understanding on the relationship between smallholder farmers’ practices and their knowledge on the environment through a case study of the water management of mangrove swamp rice (MSR) farming in Guinea-Bissau. In a theoretical framework of practice epistemologies and bridging ontologies we analyse how MSR farmers’ understanding of tides shapes their water management practices in relation to local and scientific knowledge. Our findings show that MSR farmers have a holistic understanding of the tides and other environmental factors affecting the tides such as wind. We argue that the farmers’ understanding of the environment as well as their practices are often tacit in nature. Moreover, their water management practices involve constant adaptation and sometimes improvisation, responding to socio-economic and environmental dynamics. Lastly, we argue that knowledge and practice are mutually embedded and that scientific and local knowledge can be bridged if we move away from the strict dichotomy and instead look into the multiple forms that knowledge may take.
Can wars truly build states and rationalize their structures? This study focuses on the administrative origin of state-building and finds historical evidence that seems contrary to the idea of "war-making states". As states acquire more territory, they become increasingly vulnerable to setbacks in subsequent military activities, even when facing state failure or demise. Drawing upon geospatial data spanning from 906 to 969 AD during Chinas Five Dynasties and utilizing a difference-in-differences method, our study reveals that (1) states did not progressively expand in size due to continuous warfare, and (2) larger territorial acquisitions were associated with decreased probabilities of state survival, as expanding net territorial areas corresponded to higher likelihoods of state failure in the following years. (3) The relationship between civilian and military systems within a state profoundly impacts the validity of the "war-making states" hypothesis. This study highlights that war makes states more susceptible to collapse if the military system dominates the civilian bureaucracy. Conversely, if the civilian system controls the military and forms a centralized regime, the "war-making states" hypothesis holds true. These findings revise the prevailing hypothesis of "war-making states" in historical sociology, showing that the "war-making states" hypothesis depends on a specific political structure and bureaucratic system.
The human development index (HDI) of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been subject to criticism since 1990 due to several reasons. These include the way it calculates sub-dimension indices from raw data, its method of combining these indices, and the equal weight it assigns to each sub-dimension. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) models address these criticisms by reevaluating the human development index, resolving dependency concerns, and enabling direct data extraction. Furthermore, advancements in DEA techniques have resulted in alternative models that are more appropriate for calculating HDI. The study aims to recalculate the Human Development Index of 2019 for 189 countries using the Multiplicative Non-parametric Corporate Performance Model. This model, based on multiplicative data envelopment analysis and commonly used to create composite indices from ratio data, is the basis of the study. The evaluation will assess the correlation between the MNCP model results and the values of the human development index within the framework of transforming the income level into human development. Tests of correlation between the MNCP model results and the HDI values show that the correlation coefficients are positive and statistically significant for all income-level countries, despite the observation of significant average rank differences in lower-income and higher-income countries. In line with our expectations, rearranging the weight of the sub-dimensions in the MNCP model can alter countries’ rankings, according to the findings. Nevertheless, the strong correlation values indicate that instead of focusing solely on developing a new method of calculation, it is important to underline the need to reflect on the sub-indicators used in the current HDI calculation, especially those that are open to debate, such as income.
Developmental psychologists have studied how toys shape gender schemas but have not focused exclusively on sport toys. Given persistent gender gaps in sport participation, it is important to understand how gendered meanings about sport are communicated and perceived through all kinds of play. This mixed methods research examined such meanings attached to sport toys using a content analysis and a survey. In Study 1, a content and descriptive analysis of toy listings (N =107) on retail websites revealed that most toy names lacked explicit gender labels. However, toys were more likely to display masculine color schemes and boys outnumbered girls 2-to-1 in photographs of children playing with the toys. Boys were also depicted as more actively engaged, especially with highly physical sports. In Study 2, a correlational analysis of survey responses from 530 participants indicated that adults primarily viewed sport toys as masculine, though they saw dolls, aesthetic toys, and pink toys as appropriate for girls. Aggressive sport toys were linked to boys even when they were pink, indicating limits to the impact of implicit gender markers. Together, both studies show that sports toys are still viewed as (mostly) for boys and suggest that these messages may communicate gender stereotypes about sport. Evidence-based recommendations for toy sellers regarding toy color and gender representation are included, as is advice for toy purchasers who want to encourage gender inclusive play and flexible gender schemas.
Euphorbia hirta (E. hirta), commonly known as Asthma weed, is a medicinal plant widely used for its diverse therapeutic properties. Our study addresses gaps in the understanding of its distribution, and ethnobotanical practices ofE. hirtain Kisongo and Kikwe wards in the Arusha region of Tanzania, and includes an examination of how land use types and environmental conditions affect its density. Additionally, we explore traditional knowledge and practices related toE. hirtaamong the Meru and Maasai ethnic groups. We collected data through ecological surveys from 300 plots and ethnobotanical interviews from 154 households. Our results revealed thatE. hirtathrives in anthropogenically influenced environments such as settlements and grazing lands. Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests indicate significant differences inE. hirtadensity among land use types and wards. Generalized Linear Models highlight the impact of environmental factors, with lower elevations, higher precipitation, and temperature positively affectingE. hirtadensity. Ethnobotanical surveys showed significant differences in the use ofE. hirtabetween the Meru and Maasai ethnic groups, with a high prevalence of use for urinary tract infections and respiratory conditions. We underscore the need for targeted conservation strategies and the integration of traditional knowledge into modern healthcare practices to ensure the sustainable use and conservation ofE. hirta, benefiting both biodiversity and community health.
In Denmark, and in developed countries in general, urban residents tend to report lower subjective well-being than rural residents. This difference has been referred to as a happiness paradox as cities historically have pulled in residents from the countryside in what has become known as the rural exodus. This paper explores the urban-rural happiness gap in Denmark. Using the Danish Rural-Urban Survey administered in 2011/2012 (n= 2000), the paper compares the respondents who live in the five largest cities in Denmark (Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, Aalborg, and Esbjerg) to the respondents who live in other parts of the country. The residents in the five largest cities report significantly lower life satisfaction than residents in the rest of the country. In contrast to evidence from other developed countries, this urban-rural happiness gap is found to be consistent across groups in the Danish society, e.g., across age, education, and employment groups. Further, the results show that the urban-rural happiness gap loses its statistical significance - and the two groups display similar satisfaction levels - when adjusting for several important factors. Decomposition analyses reveal that differences in urban-rural characteristics explain up to 94% of the urban-rural happiness gap. Of these urban-rural characteristics, lower access to nature amenities, lower bonding social capital, lower rates of retired people, and higher rates of non-native residents in the five largest cities in Denmark were found to account for up to 37%, 22%, 14%, and 9% of the urban-rural happiness gap, respectively.
Lower-risk Gambling Guidelines (LRGGs) were developed in Canada to reduce the risk of gambling-related harm. The LRGGs, published in 2021, consist of three limits: gamble no more than 1% of household income per month; gamble no more than four days per month; and avoid regularly gambling at more than two types of games. All three limits should be followed at the same time. This study focuses on the situation in Finland before the LRGGs were published. The aim of this study is to investigate trends in lower-risk gambling by age and net income among men and women in the Finnish adult population in 2011, 2015, and 2019. Data were drawn from cross-sectional Finnish Gambling population surveys, including permanent residents in Mainland Finland aged 15–74 with Finnish, Swedish or Sámi as their mother tongue (2011;n= 4,484, 2015;n= 4,515, and 2019;n= 3,994). The results showed an increase in the prevalence of lower-risk gambling, rising from 29% in 2011 to 39% in 2019. This upward trend was observed among both men and women, with the prevalence among men increasing from 23 to 33%, and among women from 34 to 45%. The lowest prevalence of lower-risk gambling was found among individuals aged 60–74, especially regarding expenditure guidelines, as well as among women in the lowest income tertile. In conclusion, although the prevalence of lower-risk gambling has increased in Finland, there is still potential for further improvement to minimize harm.
The aim of this study is to identify both protective and risk factors that serve as predictors of bullying victimisation among Indonesian children. This study uses data from the Children’s Worlds survey in Indonesia on 10- and 12-year-old children (N= 14,576; 49.35% boys; 47.05% 10-year-olds) who reported whether they had been bullied at home or in school in the past month. Data were analysed using binary logistic regression. Five bullying victimisation indicators (at home and at school) were employed as dependent variables, namely being hit by siblings, being called unkind names by siblings, being hit by other children in school, being called unkind names by other children in school and being left out by other children in the class. There were also five groups of independent variables: sociodemographic variables; three groups of perception variables about family, friends and school, which are measured through an agreement scale; and reported fights among children at school, measured through a frequency scale. Among the factors that increase the probability of the different types of bullying victimisation are not getting along well with friends, fights between children at school and frequent arguments between children in the class. In contrast to the other four bullying victimisation indicators, the likelihood of boys being left out by other children in the class is much lower than for girls. A negative school climate increases the odds of children being victimised at school. These results are of interest to parents, teachers and policymakers who seek to develop actions to decrease the likelihood of bullying incidents and to protect children from being victimised.
The early childhood period has lasting effects on physical and mental health. Most U.S. families rely on daily non-parental care for children under five, highlighting the importance of integrating family preferences with educator practices through reciprocal family engagement (RFE). Systems change initiatives are promising to promote RFE due to the potential to realign early childhood systems (ECS) to meet family preferences and promote positive outcomes. However, there is little research on systems-level RFE strategies. We held two focus groups with eight informants involved in RFE activities in an ECS initiative and asked informants about enablers and barriers to systems building RFE. We performed a thematic analysis using a phenomenological approach, and identified three themes: building team cohesion, capacity building and reach, and resources and capital. Our findings suggest that ECS leaders looking to enhance programmatic RFE strategy could employ relational techniques to affirm flexibility in RFE duties, model open communication, appreciate existing skills, and provide opportunities to expand skills. ECS-building may benefit from an RFE approach but should be met with bureaucratic buy-in for RFE to succeed on a structural level.
The growing number of older childless individuals in Western societies has raised concerns about their subjective well-being. In this study, we scrutinize the subjective well-being of parents and childless individuals aged 60 years and older. We examine subjective well-being as a multi-dimensional construct encompassing life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect. Based on the value-of-children approach, we hypothesize that childless individuals experience lower subjective well-being than parents and that the disparity in well-being differs with age, gender, and the quality of the parent-child relationship. For our analysis, we use data from a nationally representative sample of adults aged 60 years and older (n= 10,682) drawn from the German Ageing Survey. Our findings from random effects regression models show that childless individuals report lower life satisfaction, less positive affect, and more negative affect than parents. These associations are larger for men than for women but do not vary significantly across age groups. Furthermore, our results suggest that the benefits of parenthood strongly depend on the quality of the parent-child relationship. Childless people report lower subjective well-being than parents with a close emotional bond with their children, but similar or even higher subjective well-being than parents with an emotionally distant parent-child relationship. In sum, our study indicates that childless people experience, on average, lower well-being across all three dimensions of subjective well-being in older age. However, under specific circumstances, childless individuals may fare better than parents.
This article analyzes the reception of Russian strategic narratives to understand which discursive elements contribute to their success, and especially to their adoption in the discourse emerging from far-right online outlets employing a qualitative approach. The analysis of a textual corpus of several hundred website-based articles from Italian far-right outlets revealed how Russia is imagined as an ideal and alternative political model, described as a harbinger of morality, independence, and culture, and it is juxtaposed to a weak and culturally decadent West. The result of the analysis shows how themes pertaining to the grievances of the cultural backlash majorly contribute to the themes informing the discourse summarized above, thus uncovering an important feature contributing to the success of such propaganda efforts among disenfranchised domestic publics.
ObjectivesThe aim of the present study was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of first-time pregnant women regarding hearing loss in infants, and to identify the key factors that influence their perceptions.MethodsAfter validating and ensuring the reliability of a well-structured questionnaire consisting of 15 items, it was distributed to a total of 400 pregnant women who were experiencing their first pregnancies. Utilizing a cluster sampling method, participants were selected from both public hospitals and private gynecologist offices across diverse geographic regions in Tehran, Iran. Participants were asked to respond on a three-point scale (No, Not Sure, Yes). The results were analyzed using both descriptive and analytic statistics.ResultsThe translated questionnaire exhibited suitable face validity, test–retest reliability, and internal consistency. Findings revealed the highest maternal knowledge for "newborns can be born with hearing loss "(77.5%) and the lowest knowledge score was observed for "delayed birth cry can lead to hearing loss" (23.8%). Regarding attitudes, 72.5% of mothers scored above the mean of 5.65 out of 6, indicating a preference for early diagnosis and intervention. Several factors, such as education level and the mother’s city of residence, showed a significant correlation with certain knowledge and attitude-related questions. Notably, individuals receiving care at public hospitals showed greater knowledge compared to those visiting private clinics.Conclusions for PracticeMothers play a crucial role in child health and need to have a thorough understanding of pediatric diseases in order to make informed decisions. One particular condition that mothers should be well-informed about is hearing loss, as it has a significant impact on language development. However, this study reveals that there are gaps in maternal knowledge when it comes to the specific causes of hearing loss.
This explorative qualitative study investigated how families engage in mealtime conversations supported with decorated plates that were specially designed to promote family conversations. Our aim was to examine the main thematic and discursive patterns that naturally occurred in these conversations. Six Norwegian families of pre-school children aged 3–6 years were provided with five decorated plates and asked to audio-record their conversations during a meal. Transcripts of the audio-recordings were analysed with manifest content-related analysis, followed by an abductive analysis and a mapping of the main discourse types and interactional patterns. We demonstrate that the conversations displayed great thematic heterogeneity and represented a continuum of extended and non-extended talk, ranging from basic labelling and vocabulary recall to narration, explanation and argumentation. Variable engagement levels among the participants were also noted. We argue that decorated tableware can serve as a valuable tool for studying linguistic input and the nature of adult–child conversations during mealtimes at home and beyond.
The early years of childhood represent a critical time frame in emotional development. This qualitative study sought to elucidate the impact of parental relationships and parents’ emotional intelligence on young children’s development of emotional intelligence capacity, as well as changes in this development when a dyadic clinical intervention was applied. The study setting was a children’s psychiatric clinic in Israel. Participants were five preschool non-clinically diagnosed children (3 girls, 2 boys, aged 5–6) and their parents (1 father, 4 mothers) and five preschool clinically diagnosed children (3 boys, 2 girls, aged 5–6) and their parents (5 fathers, 4 mothers) (N= 20). Clinically diagnosed children and parents received a dyadic intervention; non-clinically diagnosed children and parents did not. The methodological framework was rooted in phenomenology. We gathered data using semi-structured interviews and applied thematic analysis to dissect the complex interplay between parents’ emotional intelligence and relationship with their children, and the children’s emotional development. Initial findings pointed to a nuanced improvement in the emotional expression abilities of clinically diagnosed children post-intervention, implying the efficacy of the intervention and suggesting the importance of integrating parental education on emotional intelligence and responsive strategies as part of child-focused interventions. This could foster children’s emotional growth and enhance parent-child relationships, contributing to a holistic strategy for fostering emotional intelligence in early childhood.
Gambling and substance use disorders (SUDs) are prevalent among U.S. military veterans and often co-occur. However, little is known about the clinical and behavioral correlates and suicidal risk of SUDs and gambling among veterans that can help inform targeted interventions for their co-occurrence. In the current study, we analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of 4069 veterans who participated in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study. Self-reported measures of lifetime SUDs and past-year gambling (Brief Problem Gambling Screen) were administered. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine differences between four groups: non-SUD/non-gambling, 40.3%; SUD-only 27.3%; Gambling-only 16.3%; and SUD + Gambling, 16.1%. The Gambling-only, SUD-only, and SUD + Gambling groups reported more adverse childhood experiences relative to the non-SUD/non-gambling group. The SUD-only and SUD + Gambling groups had higher odds for all lifetime and current clinical and trauma variables relative to the non-SUD/non-gambling group. The SUD + Gambling group had higher odds of suicidality, non-suicidal self-injury, nicotine dependence and mental health treatment relative to the SUD-only group and all assessed clinical measures relative to the Gambling-only group. Results suggest that SUDs and gambling are associated with substantial trauma and mental health burden among U.S. veterans, with co-occurring SUDs and gambling linked particularly to suicidality/self-harm and mental health treatment. The findings underscore the importance of multicomponent assessments and interventions targeting SUDs, gambling, and related concerns, such as trauma-related mental health difficulties, in this population.
ObjectivesThe New Orleans Maternal Child Health Coalition convenes to support and amplify the work of New Orleans-based individuals and organizations working to reduce disparities and protect the health of birthing families in the New Orleans area. The objectives of this qualitative study were to identify successes, challenges, and areas of growth for the Coalition and develop broadly generalizable recommendations for similar groups seeking to mobilize and advance health equity in their own communities.MethodsUsing purposive sampling, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 key informants from within and outside of the Coalition. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and data was analyzed using inductive and deductive coding approaches.ResultsWe identified themes relating to the barriers and facilitators to the maintenance of the Coalition, as well as opportunities to advance the mission of the Coalition. Some themes included structural- and systemic-level barriers to achieving the mission, varying perspectives on the effectiveness of the Coalition, opportunities to enhance the operations of the Coalition’s work, and opportunities to involve other individuals, particularly those with lived experience, and non-MCH related sectors in Coalition’s work.Conclusions for PracticeAs the maternal health crisis continues, coalitions like the New Orleans MCH Coalition provide a vehicle to amplify the mission-driven work of people and organizations. Recommendations put forth by the Coalition can also be utilized by coalitions in other jurisdictions.
We examined the associations between home literacy environment (HLE) and children’s word reading in L1 Cantonese and L2 English and whether the associations were moderated by other child- and family-related factors (children’s grade level, reading interest, and family socioeconomic status [SES]) in Hong Kong Chinese families. Participants were 190 children (Mage= 86.05 months; 54.7% female) in Grades 1 and 2, and they were tested on their word reading skills (accuracy and fluency) in L1 Cantonese and L2 English. One corresponding parent of each child responded to a questionnaire assessing two aspects of HLE (parent teaching and access to literacy resources), family SES, and their child’s reading interest. Results showed that access to literacy resources was associated with L2 English reading but not L1 Cantonese reading, regardless of grade level, parent-rated reading interest, or SES. In addition, whereas parent teaching was positively associated with L2 English reading in Grade 1, it was negatively associated with L2 English reading in Grade 2. These results suggest that whereas access to literacy resources may be positively associated with L2 English reading across different family contexts, the role of parent teaching in L2 English reading may change during this developmental period.
This study investigated the impact of family financial socialisation on the financial perceptions and behaviours of adolescents. Drawing from social learning theory, Gudmunson and Danes’ model of family financial socialisation, and the theory of planned behaviour, we examined the influence of family affluence and family financial openness on adolescents’ financial confidence, intentions, and behaviours. The research also explores gender differences and the distinct effects of family socialisation in banking and budgeting contexts. With a large sample of adolescents in New Zealand (n= 5,370), results using structural equation modelling reveal that family affluence corresponds with a higher perception of family financial openness, which influences their confidence in specific financial domains such as banking and budgeting. Our results also highlight a gap between confidence, intentions, and action in financial behaviours, with gender differences also impacting this dynamic. The findings offer insights for parents, policymakers, and financial institutions, emphasising the importance of family financial socialisation in fostering responsible financial practices among young people.
Interpretation of patient-reported outcome (PRO) scores has been supported by identifying score thresholds or ranges that indicate clinical importance. There has been a recent focus on the estimation of meaningful within patient change (MWPC). While much attention has been focused on anchor-based methods, some researchers prefer that a lower bound to these estimates should exceed a change score that could be observed due to measurement error alone as a safeguard against misclassifying individual patients as changed when they have not. The standard error of measurement (SEM) is often used as the lower bound of anchor estimates. Here, we argue that the SEM is not an the best lower bound for MWPCs. Instead, statistically significant individual change as calculated by the reliable change index (RCI) should be used as the lower bound. Our argument is based on two points. First, conceptually, the SEM does not provide specific enough information to serve as a lower bound for MWPCs, which should be based on the level of observed score change that is unlikely to be due to chance alone. Second, the SEM is not appropriate for direct application to observed scores, and requires a multiplier when examining observed change instead of true change. We conclude with recommendations for using the RCI with a thoughtful range of p-values in combination with anchor estimates.
Although numerous studies exist on the sibling relationships of children with disabilities, much less research has examined the sibling relationships of children with visual impairments. Considering the contributions of siblings to each other in terms of personality development and social functioning, the impact of visual impairments on the quality and dynamics of sibling relationships needs to be studied. We therefore investigated the sibling relationships of children with visual impairments. We performed a case study by conducting semi-structured interviews with a total of 24 participants including siblings with visual impairments, sighted sibling(s), and their parents from six families. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted for data analysis. Four superordinate themes emerged from the interviews: diverse aspects of the relationship, differing roles, mutual support, and transformative experiences. The results reveal that although the dynamics of the relationships between children with visual impairments and their siblings were similar to those of sibling relationships of typical dyads, visual impairments disturbed the natural flow of the relationship between siblings. The sibling relationships were mostly guided by feelings, and sighted siblings were a powerful source of support. Sibling dyads had a limited social life and their shared activities and times were mostly home-based. Within the context of sibling relationships of children with visual impairments, the relationships were characterized by challenges, differing roles, and positive aspects. Family members of children with visual impairments perceived the sibling relationships on a spectrum including non-disability experiences at one end and the challenge to manage typical relationships at the other end. For future directions, longitudinal research may be conducted to examine the development of sibling relationships across life, while practitioners can provide support to sibling dyads about how to spend time together and manage their relationship more effectively.
A method is proposed for defining the threshold of a ‘bad job’, based on a discontinuity in the relationship between a composite index of job quality and subjective wellbeing. Applied to European data, there is a monotonic relationship between the job quality index and psychological wellbeing. However, there is a distinctly large increase in psychological wellbeing, and in several measures of work-related wellbeing, between workers in the lowest decile and those in the second lowest decile of job quality. We therefore propose that ‘bad jobs’ should be designated as those in lowest decile. Using this threshold gives a ‘bad jobs’/ ‘other jobs’ dichotomy that discriminates on wellbeing far better than definitions based only on low earnings and job insecurity. Using multi-level probit analysis, we find that bad jobs are more common in poorer countries and in countries with weaker labour regulation. Three findings differentiate the distributional pattern of bad jobs from that of low-earnings jobs: first, the prevalence of bad jobs is greater in large establishments; second, there is no gender gap in the prevalence of bad jobs; third, working in the private sector raises the chance of being in a bad job but not of being in a low earnings job.
Transhumance practices are a clear diachronic example of sustainable use of pastureland, taking advantage of climatic and environmental differences between summer and winter. Past uses of pastureland incorporated a more balanced use of natural resources, making it possible for local communities to exploit areas that would not otherwise have been used for agricultural purposes. In contrast, industrialisation, globalisation, and the collapse of the rural economy in the twentieth century led to a profound transformation of these traditional pastoral practices. We present an overview of transhumance from Northern Iceland, Scotland, England, the Italian Alps, and Eastern Spain. The implementation of seasonal schedules for use of pastures not only avoided overgrazing but assisted settling disputes between different social groups with access to the pastures. We examine archaeological and ethnoarchaeological evidence and compare five case studies.
Given recent economic and personal challenges, inflation, and periods of unemployment, households with disabilities can become particularly financially challenged, perhaps even to the point of executing hardship withdrawals from their retirement savings. This is an important issue for Americans – particularly for families with disabilities - because typically early withdrawals from retirement accounts are subject to a 10% penalty tax (or 25% penalty tax on Simple IRAs) in addition to being taxed at the individual’s marginal tax rate. In the present study, we use the 2021 National Financial Capability Survey data and find that households with disabilities indeed have a 6.37% higher probability of taking hardship withdrawals than households without disabilities. More specifically, households with seeing, ambulatory, or multiple disabilities have a 7.04%, 7.57%, or 10.93% higher probability of taking hardship withdrawals when compared to households without disabilities, respectively. Given the understudied nature of this niche, we develop, test, and provide a downloadable prediction model that can be used by households with disabilities, financial planners, and other policymakers to identify those who are likely to take a hardship withdrawal, as well as offer practical implications.
Women have made strides in male-dominated sports but still face obstacles from gender biases and lack of diversity. Particularly in strength sports, the underrepresentation of women and lack of research on their lived experiences as athletes and coaches is notable. This study investigated the experiences of 21 women athletes and four coaches aged 18–44 in the strength sports of Olympic weightlifting, powerlifting, CrossFit, and strongman. Results showed that women athletes struggled with body image, societal expectations, gender bias and diversity, and male interactions, even as they challenged gender norms and established their presence in these male-dominated sports. Athletes’ experiences aligned with past research, but also included powerful expression of what it means to be a strong woman despite societal pressure. Women coaches also report career progression and equal employment challenges and stressed the importance of women’s representation and inclusion at all levels of these sports. Findings also indicated that while women’s performance demonstrates shifting norms for strength in these sports, more work is needed to overcome continued gender bias and to achieve equal employment opportunities for coaches. National sport governing bodies should review policy to support inclusion at all levels, and provide resources, mentorship, and training opportunities to improve accessibility to women coaches and athletes at all levels.

Quantitative research on money in politics has long relied on records from the Federal Election Commission. However, qualitative scholars can also use these records , particularly from a historical perspective. In this paper, I show that Federal Election Commission (FEC) records are beneficial for historical research by examining the consolidation of political speech and power structure analysis. In doing so, I demonstrate how looking at FEC records as a historical archive, while informative, also comes with significant challenges and one potential avenue for overcoming these limitations. The methodology has two components. First, expenditure records are used to develop a network analysis by highlighting which interest groups financially support one another or rely on the same consulting firms. These initial networks are then expanded upon through documentary analysis using data from additional reporting from the Federal Election Commission and media coverage. Finally, I demonstrate the application of the method through a comparison of the coordination practices among Mitt Romney and his supporters in the 2012 presidential election and John McCain’s in 2008.
In this study, we analyze activities in which early childhood education and care (ECEC) teachers, together with pairs of children, engage in digital storytelling activities with a tablet application. The participating teachers and children speak more than one national language, and the activity has been pursued with the intention of supporting children’s full use of their various semiotic repertoires. Theoretically informed by a sociocultural perspective, the notion of semiotic repertoires here refers to not only national languages, such as English and Swedish, but also other semiotic means for communication such as sign language, gestures, and drawings. With the purpose of addressing how ECEC can be responsive to children’s repertoires of semiotic means of communication, the research question asked is: How are various semiotic repertoires introduced and responded to in the storytelling activities? The results consist of a differentiation and specification of the meaning of responsivity in the context of semiotic repertoires. The implications for children’s participation in developmental activities and the ambition of creating socially just ECEC institutions are discussed.
Studies on migration aspirations have provided fresh perspectives for two decades by focusing on the changing nature of aspirations, the aspirations-cap/abilities nexus, and by offering a counterpoint through the ‘aspirations to stay’. Building from these, this article proposes a model to explain the intensity and strength of (im)mobility aspirations, given that these can be strong and specific but also weak, mild, conditional, and even conflicting. To do so, I focus on the preferences to migrate or to stay by examining how the two dimensions of (im)mobility – the intrinsic and the instrumental – interact. I study the different emotions and thoughts attached to (im)mobility, how life and migration aspirations are intertwined, and the ways in which migration and stay aspirations can co-exist. In doing so, I differentiate between three ideal-type strengths of aspirations:harmonious,conflicting, andindeterminate aspirations.Harmonious aspirationscapture strong convictions about what is more convenient: staying or migrating.Conflicting aspirationsstress that both migration and stay aspirations can be concurrently present and equally strong.Indeterminate aspirationsrepresent uncertainty or indifference about where to be. With this focus, the paper provides a simple approach to orient research beyond ideal-type categories by incorporating complex, often contradictory emotions. The paper draws on 37 qualitative interviews in two former mining regions in North-West Spain to advance theorization on migration aspirations and decision-making and to question if the division between migration and stay aspirations is clear-cut.
The great upsurge of witch trials in early modern Europe remains a historical puzzle. Popularly known as the “witch craze”, this eruption of persecution is puzzling because belief in witchcraft had existed for centuries, but large-scale witch-hunting appeared rather abruptly, spread widely, and was remarkably brutal in comparison with the past. We define a theory of ideational diffusion to describe the general process of the emergence and spread of a new idea along with its prescribed behavioral change, in this case the adoption of witch-hunting. Ideational diffusion distinguishes between the adoption of new ideas, which lead social actors to reinterpret the world and thus to change their behavior, and the adoption of behavior alone. We relate how a new theory of witchcraft appeared in the fifteenth century and show that its widespread propagation, owing to the new technology of printing, matches our description of ideational diffusion. We then analyze the diffusion of witch trials in Central Europe by combining data on the publication of demonological treatises alongside climate, state capacity, religious economy, and city network variables. We find that cities adopted persecution after demonological treatises were printed, and that nearby trials induced neighbors to adopt persecution. Tracing the print vectors and social interdependence spurring witch-hunting helps us understand the general mechanisms behind the spread of persecution.
Paradise on Fire (2021) by Jewell Parker Rhodes is one of a growing number of climate fiction young adult novels that offers readers opportunities to engage with concepts of climate literacy, environmental justice, and environmental racism. Much of ecocriticism is premised on the idea that when readers critically engage with texts centered on environmental and climate challenges, the reading experience serves to build understanding and empathy for climate emergencies and human-caused climate change. Arguably, children’s literature has the same potential to affect readers’ perspectives, beliefs, and actions as other forms of text. This article offers a close reading of the novel through the lens of Marek Oziewicz’s framework of climate literacy. The analysis explores the author’s craft in highlighting the complexities of environmental justice and environmental racism, held in conversation with the climate literacy notions of care for and belonging within nature spaces.
The relationship between feminist movements and racialised migrant women in Europe remains marred by the continued marginalisation of migrant women’s political claims in feminist struggles, despite the circulation of intersectional discourses within academic and activist circles. This article documents important spaces of experimentation which Black activists are creating within the Italian feminist movement to give voice to racialised migrant women without the mediating intervention of white feminists. Rooted in an understanding of the margins as a site of resistance, such efforts engage in practices ofrefusalandtalking backto reclaim a Black epistemic identity which powerfully interpellates Italian institutions and feminist activists. Black migrant women demand the recognition not only of their inherent capacity to speak, act, decide, but also of their ability to articulate a political analysis and a political project to challenge the intersectional discrimination and violence they face. Their struggle centres work as a site of compounding gendered and racialised exploitation, thus carrying the potential to expand feminist thinking and action on reproductive labour, labour participation and equal pay.
Active for the past 20 years,Sezessionis one of the most important journals of the German New Right intellectual milieu. Despite its longevity, and the importance of its contributors,Sezessionhas not garnered great attention in the study of the German New  Right and its use of religious, namely Christian rhetoric. This article takesSezessionand its employment of religious references as a starting point to question the predominant scholarly thesis that the New Right, and the far right at large, instrumentalize Christianity. This study works through the method of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) that considers both a quantitative data analysis of the number of references throughout the timeframe (2011–2018) and a qualitative analysis engaging with the portrayals of Islam and Christianity in the context of the texts. It is concluded that the conceptualization of Christianity allows its writers to present themselves as right-wing liberative Christians seeking to resist their victimization at the hands of the Church and socio-politicalleitkultur.Arguing that the New Right merely instrumentalize Christianity for a political purpose strengthens their theological self-portrait:  being perceived as an illegitimate, inauthentic, and ousted minority—be that in the public sphere or the Church—is part of the infrastructure of their Christian and political character.
Although various policies exist to reduce gender inequality, the literature suggests that many women experimented or assisted forms of sexism in working or living settings. It is claimed that sexism evolved into a more ambiguous and subtle form, turning into benevolent sexism, reverse sexism and microaggressions. Everyday sexist microaggressions mainly involve women in a series of discriminatory and humiliating messages, which can cause significant harm to their psychosocial and physical health, self-esteem, sense of identity, and job performance. The aim of the study is to examine the relationship between sexist microaggressions and unethical behaviour at work and to identify the mechanisms through which they act. Using a sample of 392 women, we proposed that sexist microaggressions predict unethical work behaviour and that this relationship is explained by the measure in which women experiencing modifications on their sense of worth (self-compassion) and in their view of themselves as women (internalised misogyny). We tested a moderated-mediation model with sexist microaggressions as predicter and unethical behaviour as outcomes, mediated by self-compassion and moderated by internalised misogyny. The results suggested that the experience of workplace microaggressions contributed to an increased likelihood of engaging in counterproductive behaviour and that self-compassion is a protective factor, which controls and reduces unethical behaviour. Significant differences also emerged in the hypothesised pattern for different levels of internalised misogyny. Studies such as this can provide insights about the reasons for diversity policy implementation failures and perceptions of negative organisational climates, but at the same time provide evidence about the content and competencies that need to be strengthened to achieve inclusion.
Early childhood professionals play a critical role in the lives of the children they work with, and their psychological well-being significantly impacts this relationship. Over recent years, societal changes, coupled with new policy, has increased the demands and pressures faced by these professionals. Therefore, the current mixed methods study set out to explore the well-being of early childhood providers (i.e., owner, owner-managers) in Ireland. In total, 489 participants completed the anonymous online survey, which included the WHO-5 questionnaire and an open-ended question that explored reasons for any stress experienced in the previous 2-week period. Almost 60% of participants scored 50 or lower and over 20% scored 28 or lower, indicating poor well-being and potential depression. The majority of participants reported feeling stressed in the 2-week period prior to completing the survey and frequently cited work-related issues as being the source of their stress. The major themes that emerged were burden of administration, overwhelming financial pressure, and staffing issues. These findings indicate that early childhood providers would benefit from bottom-up and top-down assistance to positively support their well-being. This is vital if they are to thrive in their professional roles and provide high quality, transformative experiences for our children.
Regions worldwide experienced uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreaks at different times, leading to increased health concerns yet decreased support for stringent containment measures. We aimed to understand this contradiction by examining the factors influencing attitudes toward COVID-19 containment policies in Hong Kong. Using two waves of panel data collected before and after the 2022 major outbreakN= 1148), we determined that concerns over politicization and economic implications, rather than health concerns, led to a decline in favorable attitudes. The study also revealed that political stance moderated the effect of politicization but not economic concern. Based on these findings, we offer several suggestions for public health institutions to improve public favorability: Institutions should undertake sustained efforts to reduce the politicization of containment policies. Providing economic support measures and detailed explanations to the public can help mitigate concerns. Additionally, institutions should respond more promptly to the public's economic concerns during health crises.
PurposeHealth-related quality of life (HRQoL) impacts of insomnia and depression (as separated entities) have been well investigated in previous studies. However, little is known about the effect of comorbid insomnia and depression on HRQoL. This study aimed to assess the impacts of insomnia and depression, in combination or alone, on HRQoL in Australian adults.MethodsData used in this study were obtained from the large-scale longitudinal Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey. Insomnia was defined using key insomnia criteria of DSM-V. Depression was based on validated cut-off points of the Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5) (scores ≤ 62) in the base case analysis. HRQoL expressed as utility scores (ranging from 0 to 1) were measured using the Short-Form 6-Dimension (SF-6D) converted from the SF-36 and valued using an Australian scoring algorithm. Multi-level modelling was applied to assess the effect of insomnia and/or depression on utility scores.ResultsThe study analysed 30,972 observations from 10,324 individuals (age [mean ± SD]: 45.7 ± 16.5, female: 54.6%). The proportion of individuals with insomnia only, depression only, and comorbid insomnia and depression was 11.3%, 11.6%, and 8.2%, respectively. The interaction effect suggested the combined impact of insomnia and depression on health-related quality of life beyond the sum of their individual effects. Marginal mean difference in utility scores for insomnia only, depression only, and the comorbidity relative to no insomnia or depression was -0.058 (SE: 0.003, Cohen’s d: 0.420, small effect), -0.210 (SE: 0.003, Cohen’s d: 1.530, large effect), and -0.291 (SE: 0.004, Cohen’s d: 2.120, large effect), respectively.ConclusionComorbid depression and insomnia appear to have very large quality-of-life impacts. Furthermore, this is the first study that has estimated the magnitude of the impact of comorbid insomnia and depression on utility scores which can be utilised in future clinical or economic studies.
PurposeThis study aimed to adapt and assess the content validity of the ASCOT Easy Read (ASCOT-ER) for older people accessing social care.MethodsA co-production working group of 8 older social care users and their supporters was established to evaluate the comprehensibility and relevance of the ASCOT-ER images, wording and layout. Changes made by the working group were iteratively tested using cognitive interviewing techniques (think aloud) with 25 older social care users not able to self-complete the original ASCOT.ResultsCo-research with people with dementia and their supporters was critical to the development of an effective and accessible tool. Issues identified with comprehension, recall, judgement and response were addressed through iterative adjustments to design, layout and wording. An unexpected finding was that illustrations were disliked or disregarded by the majority of people, and, in particular, those living with dementia. This result contrasts with the typical assumption of easy read approaches, where illustrations are expected to enhance comprehension.ConclusionThe ASCOT-ER measure for older people is suitable for older people using social care services with mild to moderate dementia, mild cognitive impairment and other age-related needs. The revisions applied were designed to improve comprehension, judgement and response for this group and even those who were most cognitively impaired experienced fewer issues by the final round of testing. Nonetheless, some prompting was still required, particularly for those with higher levels of cognitive impairment and it is likely that some respondents will require the questionnaire to be administered in an interview format.
Recently imposed reproductive rights restrictions have triggered widespread pro-choice protests in countries like Poland and the U.S. This study, conducted online in Poland following the 22 October 2020 decision of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal to strengthen restrictions on legal access to abortion, investigated the motivations of 939 Poles (55% women) to participate in pro-choice protests. We examined how different aspects of gender collective self-esteem and feminist identification were associated with reactance to the freedom restrictions imposed by the abortion ban and with engagement in pro-choice protests among women and men. We found that for both genders, weaker gender identification was associated with higher feminist identification, greater reactance to the abortion ban, and increased involvement in pro-choice protests. However, we observed gender differences in the motivations to participate. Women who perceived themselves as valued members of their gender group, had negative personal views about their gender or felt their gender wasundervaluedby society, were more likely to engage in pro-choice activism. Men who held negative personal views about their gender or felt their gender wasvaluedby society were more likely to engage in pro-choice protests. This study adds novel predictors to the literature on engagement in pro-choice collective action, offering practical insights into which aspects of gender collective self-esteem should be targeted to enhance feminist identification and support for the pro-choice movement.
Throughout history, humans have had a deep and complex connection with birds. The study of how humans and birds interact has the potential to provide valuable insights for the advancement of bird ecology and conservation. This review illustrates how this area has developed over time, what its main subtopics are, and what directions it should take in the future. Within ethno-ornithology, four major themes stand out: The study of birds in archaeological findings and in ancient societies; the examination of traditional and indigenous knowledge about bird ecology; the exploration of the symbolic roles birds play in the arts and media; and the investigation of various ways humans and birds interact. By acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of birds, modern-day ornithologists can bridge the gap between scientific research and public engagement, helping to raise awareness and foster for efforts aimed at bird conservation.
This article reanimates critical conversations concerning representations of female youth authorship in classic and contemporary adolescent fiction. It advocates for a reassessment of the significance of “low-brow”, “less original” types of authorship represented by fanfiction—or, what I term, “fannish writing.” Often dismissed by academics as a hindrance to the professional achievements of female writer protagonists, these modes of authorship actually provide a conduit for aspiring writers to challenge and disrupt established literary cultures and authorial conventions. This article explains how this process works in juvenile fiction by drawing from Deleuze and Guattari’s idea of minor literature, especially how this concept maps onto the characteristics of fannish writing. Through detailed analyses of L. M. Montgomery’sEmily of New Moontrilogy and Rainbow Rowell’sFangirl, this study illustrates how drawing parallels between young female characters’ fannish writing endeavours and Deleuzian minor politics offers a fresh perspective on authorial practices in femaleKünstlernarratives, enabling critics to conceptualise acts of writing beyond the expectations of dominant authorship values. In this way, this work complicates previous research that disparages the legitimacy of fanfiction in narratives of femaleKünstlerfigures, revealing the distinct and vital worth of such writing as a ‘minoritarian’ discourse that shapes our perception of the subversive capacity of young girls’ writing strategies in adolescent fiction.
Academic researchers have recently recognised the impact of family firms’ idiosyncrasies and characteristics on financial accounting practices, and identified distinctions between family and non-family businesses. However, this issue still needs appropriate systematisation and discussion. It is important to understand how family businesses’ features shape financial accounting phenomena, but the most authoritative review on the topic dates back more than 10 years. We therefore conducted a systematic review of 133 articles on financial accounting in family firms published in peer-reviewed journals up to 2023. We aimed to assess what scholars have explored so far on this topic, interpreting findings using three levels of analysis: family, business, and individual. The novelty of our paper comes from using this framework to create a thematic map that provides a comprehensive overview of the current research on this topic and developing an extensive research agenda for future studies. The article also provides practical implications for family firm managers, practitioners, and regulators by clarifying the influence of characteristics of family businesses on accounting practices.
The pursuit of a Ph.D. is a demanding journey that requires doctoral students to prioritize their well-being and be mindful of their response to pressure. Mindfulness practice has shown to be effective in reducing stress and enhancing overall well-being. The current study explores the impact of an 8-week mindfulness program on the well-being of Ph.D. students in early childhood education. Four participants engaged in daily mindfulness sessions and meditations using the Healthy Minds Program application. Results indicate that mindfulness practice had a positive impact on participants’ awareness and attention, emotional intelligence and regulation, stress and anxiety levels, and compassion levels. The findings suggest that mindfulness practice can be a valuable tool for doctoral students in managing the challenges of their program and supporting their emotional well-being. While this study yields promising results, it is important to acknowledge its limitations such as small sample size and mixed outcomes, which may limit our understanding.
Engaging in vivid conversations is crucial for the social and cognitive development of young children and for building their understanding of science phenomena. In this regard, educators play a pivotal role in shaping interactions with learners by providing adequate scaffolds to promote sustained shared thinking. Tablet computers are considered to have substantial potential for supporting learning, particularly in enriching communication and collaboration, as well as in making science phenomena more accessible. However, there are concerns that increased screen time may lead to social isolation. To address this situation, the present multiple-case study explores the impact of using tablet computers’ video functionality on the quality of teacher–child interactions during a specific play-based learning scenario in the domain of science. The investigation, which employed a mixed-method approach, followed two individual teachers separately during 24 lessons each in a videographic setup and isolated 200 science content-relevant interaction episodes. These episodes were coded according to their interaction quality in an inter-rater agreement procedure using MAXQDA. High-quality interactions were defined as those episodes involving a deep, prolonged, intellectual and content-specific exchange between the teacher and at least one child, based on both teacher and children playing their active roles in the participation of the talk. The results indicated that using tablets in the specific play scenario under investigation was associated with teacher–child interactions of longer duration, variable scaffold quality among teachers, and increased verbal engagement from children. These results counter the concerns that the use of digital media might lead to screen-based isolation and suggest that tablet computers can be harnessed for valuable educational interactions.
The aim of this article is to introduce the concept of social compass, which was developed in the research projectYouth in the cities during the COVID-19 pandemicin 2020–2022. Ethnographic observations and interviews were conducted on young people’s leisure time activities in urban spaces together with detached youth work in the biggest cities in Finland (Helsinki, Espoo, Tampere, and Vantaa). Young people were co-researchers, and their experiences were also gathered through the theatre projectGÄNG – guided city tour. In this article, we examine the movement and mobilities of young people in public, semi-public and private spaces in their leisure time. ‘Social compass’ will be used as a methodological tool to show how physical, digital and social elements are intertwined when young people navigate in urban spaces. The traditional compass is based on its ability to show the direction of magnetic north, which is used in geographical orienteering. In the case of young people hanging out, the situation is different. When they move in the city, their navigation is based not only on their knowledge of certain physical spaces but also on their knowledge of the movements of others. With the help of mobile technology and geographical position systems, young people have real-time information on their peers’ movements and can thus change their own plans smoothly. For them, mobilities are part of the process of how they engage with the world.
Motherhood occurs early in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). According to the 2007 and 2013/2014 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), about 19 and 21% of adolescents had at least one child during adolescence. In addition, during the First and Second Congo Wars, schools were closed, and many school-age girls dropped out of school as a result. This study aimed to analyze the variation in the risk of adolescent motherhood according to the war phases in the DRC and the effect of war exposure during primary school on the risk of adolescent motherhood. This study used pooled 2007 and 2013/2014 DRC DHS data, including 28,822 women. A discrete-time event history model was used to analyze changes in the probability of adolescent motherhood during the war phases. The Cox model was used to analyze the effect of exposure to war during primary school on the risk of adolescent motherhood. The findings showed a decrease in the probability of adolescent motherhood during the First Congo War and an increase during the Second Congo War, with a stronger effect in the Kivu region. In addition, exposure to war during primary school was associated with an increased risk of adolescent motherhood, with a less pronounced effect in Kivu. Teenage marriage and early sexual activity were the main mechanisms through which exposure to war during primary school increased the risk of adolescent motherhood. The First and Second Congo Wars caused girls in the DRC to drop out of school, exposing them to early sexual debut and adolescent marriages, which ultimately led to adolescent motherhood. To reduce the prevalence of adolescent motherhood, girls in the DRC need to be followed up and supported to complete their primary education.
It is widely acknowledged that traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is an endangered part of the cultural heritage of many Indigenous communities worldwide. It has also been shown that TEK can vary within a community according to variables such as the age and gender of individuals. We combine the above concepts and use intra-community variation in the ability to name local plants and animals to identify disruptions in the transmission of TEK among the Soliga/Solega community of southern Karnataka State, India. Naming ability was used as a proxy for TEK, and Soliga respondents from three ecological zones (individually, or in small gender- and age-matched groups) were shown colour pictures of 20 locally-occurring plants and birds to name. The results showed that in general, respondents were better at naming plants than birds. While there were no overall age-based differences in responses, men performed better than women in naming both plants and birds. A key finding is that in general, and separately for plants and birds, older women outperformed their younger counterparts. Several ecological and cultural reasons may be responsible for these observed patterns, which primarily indicate a disruption in TEK transmission among women, including local biodiversity loss and other hazards presented by the invasive speciesLantana camara, plus socio-economic factors like the impacts of fortress conservation, traditional patterns of marriage, a shift towards mainstream foods and medicine, and differences in the levels of education between young men and women.
This study critically evaluates and empirically tests the Trivers–Willard (TW) hypothesis, which proposes a relationship between parental socioeconomic status and sex: Parents with higher status are expected to be more likely to have male offspring and to preferentially invest in male offspring, whereas parents with lower status are expected to be more likely to have female offspring and to preferentially invest in daughters. Although the TW hypothesis has been explored in terms of offspring sex ratio and parental investment, findings in modern developed societies generally show null results, with notable exceptions in the domain of parental investment in their children’s education. Previous studies have often not explicitly addressed the potential underlying mechanisms of the TW effect. This includes the authors of the original hypothesis (Trivers and Willard1973), who discussed some potential mechanisms but ultimately left the question of mechanisms unanswered. Building on Matthews’s (2011) proposition to explore psychological underpinnings, this paper posits that the TW effect, if present, may be rooted in general parental preferences. To investigate this, a factorial survey experiment was designed to measure respondents’ preferences in parental investment while minimizing social desirability bias. The study specifically examines the extent to which respondents’ assessments of favorability and fairness in various parental investment scenarios depend on child characteristics believed to influence differential parental behavior. The findings reveal patterns that are somewhat in line with the TW hypothesis but are minor and lack statistical significance. The article concludes by proposing three future research directions aimed at further unraveling the intricacies of the TW effect.
It is well established that people with low subjective wellbeing have heightened traffic accident risk. However, the roles of particular mental states, including overall evaluative subjective wellbeing and specific forms of mental distress such as depression or anxiety, have not hitherto been disentangled. Using an official representative population survey, we show that different forms of mental distress are associated with single versus multiple accident prevalence within a year. Anxiety (a lack of calmness) is strongly associated with having an accident. By contrast, conditional on having had at least one accident, overall life satisfaction is more strongly associated with having multiple accidents than are anxiety, depression or overall mental health. The relationship is n-shaped so that people with moderately low wellbeing have the highest multiple accident probability. These results are robust to the exclusion of respondents for whom reverse causality may be present and to the inclusion of variables representing other risky behaviours and representing social isolation. The findings imply that specific forms of intervention are likely to be needed to reduce accidents for people with moderately low subjective wellbeing who may engage in habitual risky behaviours that result in multiple accidents.
Numerous countries around the globe have undertaken efforts aimed at enhancing political representation. One of these efforts has taken the institutional form of reserved seats or ethnic districts where individuals must choose where to deposit their votes. In this paper, we ask if group consciousness and organizational membership affect the choice to vote on these types of districts. Using a mixed-methods approach by combining semi-structured interviews with elites and a subgroup analysis of a conjoint experiment in a sample of Afro-Colombians, we find evidence that group consciousness affects the preferences for ethnic districts over territorial ones. Contrary to initial expectations, we observe that membership in ethnic organizations does not significantly alter preferences for ethnic districts among surveyed individuals. These findings indicate that individuals with high levels of group consciousness tend to choose to participate more in mechanisms and institutions that can enhance the group’s political representation.
One of the key features of gambling disorder (GD) is impairment in cognitive-emotional control. Considering the negative consequences of GD, the present study investigated the effectiveness of emotional working memory training (eWMT) in improving cognitive control, attention, working memory capacity, and cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) among young adults with GD compared to a placebo group. Following the initial assessment in the pre-test phase, eligible participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: experimental (n= 34) and placebo (n= 30). These groups completed eWMT and a feature matching task for 20 sessions respectively. The post-test and follow-up measures indicated that eWMT significantly improved cognitive control, attention, working memory capacity, and the use of maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies, but it had no significant effect on adaptive CERS. The promising results of the present study suggest the use of eWMT as a new intervention to improve cognitive-emotional control among individuals with online gambling problems.
Amid patriarchal conditions that render one son necessary and multiple daughters burdensome, selective abortion of female fetuses has become pervasive in India. Public responses often cast sex selection as self-evidently ignorant, cruel, and misogynistic – an obvious evil meriting denunciation and eradication. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Gujarat state, this article zooms out from ultrasound and abortion to survey the landscape of biomedical, herbal, and religious son production techniques surrounding them. Doing so clarifies the lived moral experience in which sex selection is embedded. Resort to multiple son production techniques is both an abstractmoral indicatorreflecting prevailing concerns and a pragmaticmoral interventionaimed at harnessing every available means in response to those concerns. Fundamentally, people live out the multimodal quest that sometimes leads to selective abortion as aspiration – social, bodily, spiritual – toward an indispensable good, not as heartless rejection of daughters. Pluralistic son production illuminates the moral uses of medical pluralism for care-seekers, social scientists, and policymakers and practitioners. The case underscores that “complementary” therapies, rather than being just desperate behaviors, barriers to biomedical therapy, or curiosities to be integrated into care, may in fact be the clearest markers of the moral conditions in which public health problems unfold.
Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a public health problem that leaves lasting, distressing impacts on college women, yet little is known about the role fathers play as support for these women. The current study examines paternal warmth and involvement as mediators between physical and emotional IPV and emotional dysregulation and depression. Data were gathered from 201 female students that completed an online survey in exchange for extra credit. Using structural equation modeling, the indirect effect from physical abuse to emotional dysregulation and depressive symptoms were significant and positive. The indirect relationship between psychological abuse to emotional dysregulation and depressive symptoms through parental involvement were significant and negative, indicating that IPV typologies are differentially associated with perceptions of fathering. Implications from this study indicate the impact a father’s warmth and involvement can have on his daughter’s emotional regulation and depressive symptoms, as well as how psychological versus physical IPV may differentially impact fathering behavior.
Recently, there has been a growing trend in using large language models (LLMs) to develop diverse applications suitable for a wide range of tasks. These tasks range from solving programming bugs to helping teach elementary school students how to enhance their writing. Even with all these beneficial use cases, researchers worry about the potential bias these tools could produce and their effect on society. In this research, we compared responses that resulted from prompting two chatbots, namely OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard, about the issue of gene editing. Twelve prompts that are part of two subgroups were used to generate responses (text) about the issue of gene editing when the political affiliation (Democrat, Republican, and Communist) or geographical areas (United States, China, and Europe) of the prompter is provided. The Twelve responses were then analyzed semantically using three dictionary-based tools, i.e., Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, the Moral Foundation Theory and Biblical Ethics dictionary, and Google’s Perspective API, to test and analyze the semantic and linguistic differences (measured via the Mann–Whitney U test) in the responses returned from the two chatbots. The results suggest that there are semantic and linguistic differences in responses per chatbots and prompts.
Early risk factors for gambling participation (GP) and substance use (SU) in adolescents have usually been studied separately, although these disorders were integrated into the same clinical category over a decade ago. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the early individual, parental, familial and social risk factors associated with developmental patterns of adolescent GP and SU in a population-representative cohort (N = 1594, 51.2% boys). Using a person-centered strategy and multiple assessments from age 12 to 17, six developmental patterns describing joint GP and SU courses were revealed. Non-substance users/non-gamblers served as the reference class in an integrated longitudinal-multivariate analysis framework examining 15 distinct risk factors. Results showed that a core of risk factors were common to all trajectory-classes of substance users with or without GP. For a similar level of SU, most of the risk factors associated with non-gambling users also affected their gambling peers. However, additional risk factors were specifically related to GP. Thus, substance users who also gamble were affected by a greater number of risk factors than non-gambling substance users. Findings are consistent with a developmental syndrome of addiction, which posits a shared etiology between different expressions of addiction as well as differences in risk factors that lead to distinct trajectories of addictive behaviors. They highlight the importance of considering both GP and SU for a comprehensive assessment of adolescents’ level of risk with regard to addictive behaviors.
This paper fills a notable gap in the existing literature on birth outcomes and extreme temperatures by examining the causal moderating effect of energy prices on the impact of extreme temperatures during pregnancy on birth weight. It uses a sharp increase in energy prices that occurred in Spain in March 2021 as an identification strategy and incorporates a new weather dataset that increases the number of monitors from which temperature information is derived in previous research by more than sixfold. The results show that the negative effects of extreme temperatures on birth weight are amplified at higher energy prices, especially for mothers of lower socioeconomic status. By focusing on how energy prices moderate the impact of extreme temperatures on birth outcomes, opportunities arise for policy interventions aimed at reducing health inequalities at birth. Moreover, given the critical role that events in utero play in individuals’ later development, such policies have the potential not only to reduce health inequalities at birth, but also to address broader inequalities in long-term outcomes.
In an ageing and ever lonelier society, volunteering based on intergenerational relationships is becoming an increasingly salient form of support, but also a valuable leisure activity. With the help of thematic analysis, the study explored (1) how young adult volunteers working with seniors perceive their work and (2) what encouraged them to take up the volunteering role and what makes it easier or possible for them to remain active. Interviews were conducted in Poland in 2020 with 10 volunteers aged between 22 and 35 (6 women, 4 men) who had experience of working with seniors during the year preceding the study. Seven issues emerged from the analysis: the context in which volunteering began; personal characteristics of the volunteer; daily difficulties of the elderly; keeping the senior company in transience and loneliness; attachment and relationship between the volunteer and the elderly person(s); personal benefits of involvement in volunteering; social benefits of involvement in volunteering. The results were discussed in the light of the volunteer process model and the types of volunteers’ motivations. Several volunteers also pointed to the role of volunteering not only in building a norm of reciprocity in relationships with seniors, but also more broadly in the society.
BackgroundSince 1990, childhood overweight and obesity have been rising on every continent and have almost doubled worldwide. The deleterious consequences include hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia leading to metabolic syndrome in childhood and myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer and other disabling conditions in adulthood.PurposeIn Southern Europe, including Greece, Italy, and Spain, 10 to 15% of children are obese. Obesity in Eastern European countries is somewhat lower, but the rates of rise are very steep and will approach those in Southern Europe during the next few years. Worldwide, Asia accounts for nearly half of all overweight children under the age of 5, while Africa is home to one quarter of overweight children under 5. In Latin America, about 20% of children under 20 are overweight. Further, children living in poverty can suffer simultaneous overweight and obesity as well as malnutrition. In the US, the risk of being overweight in adolescence is several times higher when a younger child has a body mass index (BMI) in the 50th or greater percentile.FindingsIf the clinical, non-clinical and public health communities ignore these challenges, such inaction will surely portend an unprecedented future pandemic of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents leading to future premature morbidity and mortality. All clinical, non-clinical and public health professionals should exert concerted efforts concerning their individual patients, their families, communities, and policymakers.ConclusionsSuch coordinated interdisciplinary efforts may curb these alarming trends and secure healthier futures for children and their families throughout the world.
Water insecurity is a global concern likely to be compounded by increases in population and climate change. Existing water insecurity measurement methods capture multidimensional deprivation only at regional or sub-regional levels. Such estimates do not capture heterogeneous household experiences of water supply, proximity to water sources and affordability, which can vary substantially from regional averages. Accurate measurement requires a method that captures the incidence and intensity of a household’s simultaneous deprivation in dimensions of water accessibility, affordability, sufficiency and safety. We propose such a method and assess related inequalities using an approach analogous to the Alkire–Foster methodology for multidimensional poverty. Using household-level data from the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey 2015/16, we find that 63% of the Kenyan population experience multiple deprivation in water access. The dimensions of water affordability and sufficiency contribute most to multidimensional water insecurity, highlighting the need to ensure an adequate supply of affordable water. Disparities by household place of residence, dwelling type, and socio-economic status are evident. The estimates of multidimensional water insecurity are robust to different deprivation and poverty cutoffs. Our analysis is an invitation to rethink water insecurity metrics, allowing water deprivation to be measured more frequently and with greater precision to understand its impact clearly.
Although parental psychological control has been found to be detrimental to children’s psychological functioning, less is known about the role of internal and external maternal and paternal psychological control in preschoolers’ socio-emotional development. In this cross-sectional, multi-informant study, we rely on the self-determination theory to examine the relations between internal (i.e., guilt induction) and external (i.e., constraining verbal expressions and erratic emotional behavior) mother-reported and father-reported psychological control and preschoolers’ (N= 136; 51.5% males;Mage= 5.53,SD= 0.66 years) externalizing symptoms, internalizing symptoms, and social competence, as reported by their teachers. Regression analyses revealed unique relations between internal and external psychological control and preschoolers’ social-emotional adjustment. While external psychological control related negatively to preschoolers’ social competence and positively to anger-aggression, internal psychological control emerged as the unique predictor of anxiety-withdrawal. Importantly, the results indicated that these findings were consistent for both mothers and fathers. Our findings suggest that parental internal and external psychological control differentially relate to children’s socio-emotional adjustment in early childhood.
There is a body of literature that examines and describes couples’ relational quality and emotional security through an attachment lens. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on specific attachment behaviors, including accessibility, responsiveness, and engagement, and their role in creating and maintaining a secure attachment bond between romantic partners. The purpose of this study was to use deductive grounded theory methods to examine whether these three attachment behaviors are reflected in couples’ own descriptions of safety and security in their relationships. Analysis of secondary qualitative data from 26 interviews confirmed the importance of accessibility, responsiveness, and engagement in couple relationships, and adds descriptions of how individuals in couple relationships experience attachment strengthening interactions. These findings can help professionals and researchers become more sensitive to how attachment behaviors manifest in interactions and affect the quality of intimate relationships.
This paper aims to investigate the role of big data analytical (technological, management, talent) capabilities of family businesses and examines the dual aspects of family leadership focus and family members’ concerns to sustain the business. Further, the study explains the generational transition, innovation, and tradition paradox and proposes a solution to maintain the family legacy. Family businesses are crucial sources of wealth in Southeast Asian countries and 80% of Thailand’s family businesses are owned by second or third generations and so on. The data is collected from Phuket, Thailand which is a regional hub of family businesses. The respondents of study 203 businesses were chosen for data collection and further interpreted through Smart PLS 4.0. The results found that big data analytics management capabilities are significantly associated with the innovation and learning performance of family members and sustainable family business excellence. specifically, talent capabilities and technological capabilities have an insignificant association with a direct relationship with sustainable family business excellence. Furthermore, the moderating role of family members’ adaptability to change is particularly insignificant, associated with big data analytics technological capabilities and sustainable family business excellence. The study analysis revealed mixed findings and generally advocated the need for big data implications in a family business. Most literature focused on non-family businesses, and this study is one of the pioneering studies that discuss big data integration in a family business as a driver of sustainable excellence.
This study explores award-winning nonfiction picture books from the last ten years (2013–2023) that feature collective action for social justice in early childhood education. Drawing from a critical content analysis of Orbis Pictus and Sibert Book Medal winners, we spotlight four books that showcase historical models of collective action. These texts challenge societal norms, inviting discussions on equity and fairness. Utilizing the Recognize, Ask, Do (ReAD) framework, we propose instructional strategies to equip educators in addressing unfairness and promoting collective action. Amid concerns of censorship, we empower educators to integrate quality literature that cultivates socially just mindsets. By emphasizing texts that promote collective action and social transformation, this study contributes to the discourse on equity and inclusivity in early childhood education, laying the groundwork for a more just society.
This study examined factors associated with four domains of school readiness among 170 preschoolers from low-income families in seven Malaysian public preschools. Direct assessments of preschool children’s performance on a battery of tasks indicated proficient levels of readiness in approaches to learning, language and emergent literacy, and socioemotional development. Relative to other domains, children demonstrated lower levels of readiness and greater variability in cognitive development. Using a multi-level modelling approach, the duration of Early Childhood Education (ECE) participation was positively associated with improvements in language and emergent literacy while controlling for child and other contextual factors. However, duration of ECE participation correlated negatively with socioemotional development. Additionally, household wealth was a significant predictor of better academic outcomes in language, literacy, and cognitive development. This study underscores the importance of nuanced educational policies that address the duration and quality of ECE and the socioeconomic disparities that affect school readiness to ensure comprehensive developmental support for Malaysian preschoolers from low-income families.
Non-prescription weight loss substances, such as supplements and herbal remedies, can be harmful. Hispanic immigrant students may be highly susceptible to these substances, especially those advertised on social media. This study was a feasibility/acceptability pilot trial of an intervention to reduce this susceptibility. Latino or Hispanic immigrant students aged 18–35 were randomized to receive either a single-session, culturally tailored online intervention (Redes Sociales Para la Salud), or a dose-matched intervention focused on general support for immigrant students (Immigrant Support). Following the intervention, participants answered quantitative and open-ended questions about intervention satisfaction, and completed measures of susceptibility to non-prescription weight loss substances. Participants additionally completed measures of social media use and social norm perceptions. Fifty-five participants enrolled in the study, and 32 had primary outcome data. Participants were majority female (62.5%) and graduate students (81.3%) with a mean BMI of 24.6 ± 3.5 kg/m2. Ratings of intervention satisfaction were moderate (3.5–3.7 out of 5). In open-ended questions, participants identified areas of high satisfaction (cultural appropriateness, learning new information) and suggested improvements (increase interactivity, improve presentation appearance). Considering signal of an effect, participant ratings indicated that susceptibility to non-prescription weight loss substances was lower afterRedes Sociales Para la Saludcompared to the control intervention. In exploratory analyses, susceptibility to non-prescription weight loss substances was positively associated with extent of social media use (r= 0.41–0.46) and social norms about use of these substances (r= 0.38). With additional refinement, theRedes Sociales Para la Saludhas promise for addressing susceptibility to non-prescription weight loss substances.

“What gets measured gets managed” has long been a mantra to rally improvement throughout various domains of life. Perhaps this is also the case for existing work on social cohesion, whereby much of its conceptual and operational elements have received interest in both academic and policy research aiming for practical improvement with regard to the cohesiveness of communities and societies. We contend, however, that not everything that matters for social cohesion may be measurable, and not everything that has been measured for social cohesion may matter. This is not to suggest that not measuring any indicators is better than measuring them, but to caution that existing measures of social cohesion, as well-developed as they may currently be, might still be lacking in their ability to accurately assess the state of social cohesion in a given society. This paper sets out to question when and why measurements may fail. It seeks to critique current indicators of social cohesion by recognising what and who are missing from existing measures. To this end, we also call for discussion of alternative approaches to measuring social cohesion for areas where data is restricted or not easily accessible.
Previous research has dealt with whether low socioeconomic status directly affects a child’s mental health or if the relationship is mediated by the parent’s mental health. Few studies have used various household economic hardship measures within the same setting. The objectives are first to analyse the mediation effect of parents’ mental health on children’s mental health due to unemployment, material deprivation, and food insecurity, accounting for parenting practices and the neighbourhood environment, and second to identify differences between externalising and internalising mental health disorders. We use cross-sectional data from the Barcelona Health Survey for the year 2016, with a representative sample of 390 children from 4 to 14 years old in Barcelona city. The mental health of the respondent parent is measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12 items) and that of the child with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-25 items). Mediation analysis is performed using pathway analysis under the Structural Equation Model. The association of the three economic hardship measures with overall child mental health confirms the mediating role of parents’ mental health. However, a direct effect on internalising mental health disorders remains for severe material deprivation and food insecurity, but not for externalising mental health disorders. The proxies for parenting practices play a moderate role. Violence in the neighbourhood is associated with poorer children’s and parents’ mental health across the models.
Adolescent well-being is increasingly scrutinized due to its decline. This study was conducted to validate a theory-driven instrument for the measurement of well-being needs with a sample of Dutch adolescents. The short (15-item) Social Production Function Instrument for the Level of well-being (SPF-ILs) measures whether a person’s needs for stimulation, comfort, behavioural confirmation, affection and status are met. In this study, its psychometric properties for adolescents were examined. Data collected in spring 2018 (T1) and spring 2019 (T2) from 1,304 Dutch adolescents (53.0% girls) aged 11–17 (mean, 13.7 ± 1.1) years were used. The instrument’s factor structure, internal consistency, construct validity, and gender and age factorial invariance were evaluated. The results showed that the SPF-ILs is valid and reliable for the assessment of adolescents’ well-being needs realisation. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the five-factor (stimulation, comfort, behavioural confirmation, affection and status) model, showing good internal consistency (α = 0.86 at T1, 0.88 at T2), convergent/divergent validity, as well as gender and age factorial invariance. Comparison across groups revealed the expected differences in the realisation of physical (comfort and stimulation) and social (behavioural confirmation, status and affection) well-being needs between girls and boys and over time. SPF-ILs use increases our understanding of how adolescents achieve well-being via the fulfilment of well-being needs. The maintenance of adolescents’ well-being is a global challenge, and this study revealed clear differences in adolescents’ realisation of well-being needs, increasing our understanding of what interventions are needed to support such realisation.
Picturebooks are a unique and complex art form that combines both visual and textual elements. Based on Kohlberg’s Cognitive Development Theory and Social Gender Theory, young children’s perceptions are likely influenced by portrayals of mothers in picturebooks. Therefore, this content analysis examined both the text and the visual portrayals of mothers in 53 bestselling picturebooks from China between 2019 and 2022, related to the portrayals of mothers. The results revealed a wide and diverse range of representations of the mother’s role through both illustrations and text in these popular picturebooks, contributing to the replacement of persistent gender stereotypes. Illustrations revealed patterns related to anthromorphic characters in about 66% of analyzed books as well as patterns related to gendered clothing, accessories, and scene placements, such as the aprons or the kitchen. Additionally, themes of the Caring Mother, Intelligent Mother, All-powerful Supermom, and Defective Mother emerged through our analysis based on the text. Finally, aligned within the Chinese sociocultural context and with Social Gender Theory, the paper provides authors, illustrators, educators, teachers, and parents with recommendations for creating, selecting, and leveraging picturebooks to serve as positive portrayals of mothers for young readers.
Studies about older people’s participation in artistic activities have increased. However, a deeper understanding of older artists’ adaptation to the ageing process is still lacking. The purposes of this study were to explore how older artists and craftspeople perceive age-related changes, and to examine their adaptations to these changes. We carried out in-depth, open-ended individual interviews with 30 visual artists and craftspeople aged 60 and older. We found that almost all of them experienced age-related changes in relation to their artistic engagement, which they mainly associated with health-related issues, namely sensory losses and physical changes. In addition, we identified six strategies aimed at adjusting to age-related changes: adapting the work pace, modifying the artistic practice, using technical aids, engaging in artistic collaboration, developing environmental adaptations, and implementing self-care practices. Most participants discussed at least one strategy to adapt to age-related changes, and it was common to combine various strategies. Findings were discussed from a lifespan perspective. Our study expands previous research on experiences of artistic participation among older people, and specifically on their modes of adapting to the ageing process in the context of their artistic practices.
The access to care benefits of Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions are important for 45–64-year-old adults who are living below 100% of the Federal Poverty Level, a particularly vulnerable group in the United States (US). Gaining coverage from Medicaid expansions should improve access to healthcare and affect social determinants of health, including financial behavior. We analyzed data from 2009 to 2018 from the National Financial Capability Survey (NFCS) and utilize a difference-in-differences model to compare outcomes changes in states with and without expansion before and after the ACA Medicaid expansions. Overall, Medicaid expansion was associated with increased healthcare access for 45–64-year-olds, potentially resulting in better healthcare experience. Results indicate effects of the Medicaid expansion on the financial behavior of 45–64-year-olds, with evidence of credit card bills being paid in full, higher banking activities, and better financial preparedness. These findings have important implications for financial regulators and healthcare policymakers.
The literature on listening and daily discourse often describes an overly romanticized conception of listening, meaning what it should be in its ideal form. However, at most, this ideal is realized through the ‘masks’ that listeners ‘carry’ during their performance of listening. The ideal version that is being projected through the performance of listening is not cognruent with what actually happens behind the mask and performance. Individuals do not have the cognitive capacities to realize this unrealistic and unattainable ideal, but they have the capacity to actas ifthey do. Using Goffman’s (1959) dramaturgical account this paper reveals the psychological and social world that hides behind the mask and performance of listening in order to ground the theorizing of listening in a more realistic perspective. This account gives rise to novel and indispensable listening concepts: the definition of the situation, the sincere and cynical listener, undercurrent listening, and misrepresentations of listening. These concepts demonstrate that the study of interpersonal listening cannot be isolated from the dramaturgy of listening as (expressed) manners of listening are intricately and inherently embedded in social structure. This account also strongly contests the psychocentric and simplistic definition of listening as proposed by Kluger, A. N., & Mizrahi, M. (2023).

Despite its low contribution to greenhouse gases emission, Latin America is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. Economic, social, and political factors make difficult the preparation for ongoing and future impacts. Few studies have explored how people in this region perceive and respond to climate change. In this scenario, we conducted an online survey to address the following research question: How sociodemographic factors are influencing perceptions and emotional responses associated with climate change in LA countries? The final sample consisted of 7232 people, with an error of 2.8% for the total population from 18 countries, representing 67% of the region’s internet-accessible population. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations, and mixed linear models. Results indicate a consensus on the fact that climate change is already happening, that is totally or partially caused by human activities, that will worsen poverty and inequalities but also that is an opportunity to build a fairer society. Sociodemographic differences were also found, showing the importance of sex, age and having or not having children in multiple variables. We hope this study will contribute to a better understanding of this complex social issue, informing policies to encourage a greater engagement with climate action.
This study explored specificity in the associations between early poverty and preschoolers’ behavioral and attentional regulation. In particular, there was an emphasis on delineating contextual factors (i.e., material hardship and household chaos) and parenting processes (i.e., maternal aggravation and maternal acceptance) as sequential mechanisms. The sample included 2850 families from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Results suggested that early poverty in infancy (age one) was associated with behavioral regulation and attentional regulation in preschool years (age five). Material hardship mediated the link between early poverty and behavioral regulation, while household chaos mediated the link between early poverty and attentional regulation. Additionally, maternal aggravation mediated the association between material hardship and behavioral regulation, while maternal acceptance mediated the associations between household chaos and attentional and behavioral regulation. Findings informed targeted interventions to alleviate hardship and chaos and promote positive parenting practices to bolster children’s self-regulation.
Home visiting programs are an evidence-based approach to reducing adversity exposure and promoting well-being in children experiencing high-risk factors. Despite decades of research demonstrating the benefits of these programs, barriers continue to impact enrollment, engagement, and retention over time. The present qualitative study explored home visiting providers’ perceptions of the behaviors they use to promote enrollment and engagement and reduced attrition for families. Twenty-one providers of three home visiting models (Nurse-Family Partnership, Parents as Teachers, and SafeCare) completed in-depth, semi-structured interviews to probe into provider behaviors that might improve program outcomes. Qualitative data analysis of interviews was conducted using NVivo software with a template approach used to identify broad themes. Findings indicated differences in provider behaviors across enrollment (provider approach and outreach), engagement (provider support and communication), and retention (provider sharing resources and setting goals). Across all three, providers emphasized the importance of building rapport. Implications suggest that workforce structure and training include behavioral strategies to improve enrollment, engagement, and retention in programs to promote program and familial success.
Mobile devices are now widely used, including by young children in even the poorest communities, but too little research has examined their effects. Past research suggests that mobile media may affect school readiness, and that this relation could depend on the content used. We examined the relation between mobile media use and a composite school readiness measure of preliteracy, emergent math, and executive functioning, in low-SES preschoolers. Parents reported that children most frequently used mobile media to watch video content, and that few of the apps used by their children were educational. As predicted, time spent using mobile media predicted poorer school readiness skills, especially executive functioning. Parent reported use of educational apps was associated with stronger executive functioning, but otherwise we did not find predicted moderation effects of educational app use. Overall, study results support efforts to limit and improve the quality of screen time of preschoolers.
The present research is focused on how lifelong gender inclusive education moderates the effect of governance on structural transformation. It is based on a sample of forty-one countries in Africa for the period 2004 to 2021 and the adopted empirical strategy is the generalized method of moments (GMM). The estimation exercise is tailored such that lifelong gender inclusive education is interacted with political (i.e., political stability/no violence and voice & accountability), economic (i.e., government effectiveness and regulatory quality) and institutional (i.e., corruption-control and the rule of law) governance dynamics in order to affect manufacturing value added. Lifelong gender inclusive education is understood as the combined knowledge acquired in terms of gender parity education in primary, secondary and tertiary schools. The following findings are established. (i) Gender inclusive lifelong learning does not effectively moderate political governance and associated components (i.e., political stability/no violence and voice & accountability) as well as institutional governance and associated components (i.e., corruption-control and the rule of law) in order to improve manufacturing value added. (ii) Gender inclusive lifelong learning effectively moderates economic governance and associated dimensions (i.e., government effectiveness and regulatory quality) to improve manufacturing value added. However, only the thresholds corresponding to government effectiveness and economic governance are within policy range. Robustness of the findings is broadly confirmed, especially within the remits of additional elements in the conditioning information set and general governance. Policy implications are discussed.
Previous research on parent‒child relationships has focused more extensively on younger, school-aged children and adolescents, with mothers receiving more attention than fathers. In addition, there has been a greater focus on problematic parenting (e.g., helicopter parenting) and less research on supportive forms of parenting that can promote positive outcomes during emerging adulthood. The current study utilized the framework of self-determination theory to examine the association between positive parenting and well-being in a sample of emerging adults. Specifically, we examined the associations between positive maternal and paternal parenting approaches and emerging adults’ basic psychological needs and well-being, with a focus on emerging adults of diverse ethnicities. Our primary hypotheses were that positive parenting would have significant: (a) direct associations with emerging adults’ basic psychological needs and (b) indirect associations with emerging adults’ well-being through their basic psychological needs. The participants were 1209 emerging adults aged 18–22 years (M= 19.27;SD= 1.53). The results revealed that parenting had significant positive direct effects on emerging adults’ basic psychological needs and indirect associations with their well-being. These findings suggest that positive parenting continues to play an important role in emerging adulthood and highlight the need to work with emerging adults and their parents to establish strategies to support positive parenting that meet psychological needs during this time of life.
Safety behaviors attenuate the effects of exposure therapy. Less is known about how safety behaviors interact with parenting behaviors in relation to anxious children’s fear responses. We examined if child safety behaviors interact with maternal punitive responses to explain unique variance in children’s fear downregulation—defined as self-reported reduction of anxious arousal—during an anxiety-provoking task. Anxious children ages 8–12 (N= 105; 57.1% female; 61.9% racial minority) completed a diagnostic interview and structured speech task. Mothers reported how often they responded punitively to children’s negative emotions. Independent observers coded child safety behaviors used during the speech, and a fear downregulation score was computed per child by subtracting post-speech fear scores from pre-speech fear scores. The interaction between child safety behaviors and maternal punitive responses predicted unique variance in subjective fear downregulation, such that increased use of safety behaviors during the speech task was associated with more difficulties downregulating subjective fear only among children whose mothers reported moderate and high use of punitive responses. Maternal punitive responses to children’s negative emotions may promote child safety behavior use to avoid anxiety, resulting in greater difficulties downregulating fear. Our findings provide preliminary evidence for targeting child safety behaviors and parenting behaviors during child anxiety treatment.
This study explores the role of family interpersonal relationships in coping with the effects of COVID-19 and examines factors that place Latinx adolescents at risk for adverse effects of COVID-19 and promote resilience. We used a qualitative inquiry to explore the impact of COVID-19 on Latinx New York City adolescents, using sensitizing concepts from the family stress and coping theory as a data organization and analysis strategy. Five focus groups with 26 students aged 13 to 17 years old were conducted, and emergent themes were identified from the data. Latinx student participants reported disruptions in their family structure and interaction patterns. Families of these adolescents faced income loss, death, and illness from COVID-19, which impacted parent-child relationships. The absence of needed community resources undermined family resilience. Yet, students used internal resources found in their families and within themselves to cope with the COVID-19 stressors. Participants reported challenges within the family, school, and youth’s daily experiences. To lessen the pandemic’s impact on Latinx students in the midst of the ever-changing COVID-19 pandemic requires an ecological approach in which family, school, community, and policy factors are considered, and partnerships at each of these levels are established. Efforts to enhance family-school collaboration, equitable access to mental health services, youth outreach, and strengthen existing internal and external resources in the lives of Latinx students are key to promoting their well-being.
BackgroundIn 1983, 2001, 2002 and 2020 Swedish legislation has sought to strengthen children’s rights to family belonging in foster care, as well as their voices in decision making. The aim of this study was to understand how children in long-term foster families and children whose custody has been transferred experience family belonging within these different legal contexts. Methods: Six participants aged 11–17 years were recruited. The data were collected through narrative interviews. Both verbal and visual methods were used in data collection and narrative analysis was used to capture a comprehensive understanding of the stories. Findings: It is suggested that a sense of family belonging can be understood through the following themes: “To spend time”, “To share experiences”, “To be seen, cared for, and supported”, “To resemble someone”, and “To know or not to know”. Conclusion: Practical implications of the findings are discussed in relation to planning, guidance, and decision-making within foster care. The results, if implemented in practice, could have an impact on how to discuss foster children’s sense of family belonging within the foster care system.
Behavior problems are common among young autistic children and are related to elevated parenting stress levels among their caregivers. However, previous studies of this population have rarely examined relations between child behavior problems and parenting stress at a daily level and, to date, have not examined how these relations may differ for Latino families. Using a day-to-day, within-person design, this study bidirectionally examined these temporal relations among 70 families of autistic children (ages 3–5 years, 74.3% male, 49% Latino parents) who participated in a 14-day daily-diary study. Parent-reported child behavior problem severity and parenting stress were measured daily. Constructs were partitioned into their between- and within-person components and analyzed using time-lagged MLM models. At the between-person level, greater reported child behavior problem severity, relative to the group average, was positively associated with next-day parenting stress and vice versa. This relationship was moderated by Latino ethnicity, such that the positive relationship between reported child behavior problem severity and next-day parenting stress was weaker for Latino (versus non-Latino) families. These bidirectional relationships differed at the within-person level, such that, unexpectedly, greater-than-usual parenting stress, compared to parents’ownaverage, was negatively associated with next-day child behavior severity. Findings underscore the value of using daily diary methodology to decompose between- and within-person effects, and reveal potential intervention targets to improve parent and child functioning, particularly among minoritized families of autistic children.
Analysis of journalistic fields is dominated by approaches that take news media at the nation-state level as the major unit of analysis. More recently, sociologists have asked whether we can speak of global journalistic fields. Many scholars have concluded that global journalistic fields are weak at best, and news production remains bounded by nation-states. This paper offers a more fine-tuned understanding of the boundaries of journalistic fields. Drawing on an interview-based qualitative study of regional journalistic fields in contemporary Crimea (a region of Ukraine annexed by Russia in 2014) and in Tatarstan (a region of Russia), I answer the questions “how do states shape the autonomy of regional journalistic fields?” and “how do journalists navigate the limitations they face?” I advance two arguments: first, journalistic fields can be understood as multiscalar fields, and the practices of journalists are shaped by the configuration of political relations along different scales simultaneously (the scale of the city, the region, the national scale, the scale of other nation-states, and the international arena). Second, the scales that exert the most influence on journalistic fields can change depending on whether the nation-state or the region is embroiled in conflict.
Scholars contend that craft spirit makers communicate authenticity by emphasizing their passion for and commitment to tradition and by downplaying self-interest and profit. However, the presence of large corporations has made it more difficult for consumers to distinguish “true” artisanal values and methods from imitators. The lucrative craft spirit market has exposed the susceptibility of authenticity, which is often thought to be a distinguishing feature between craft and industrial firms. Drawing on the analysis of semi-structured interviews with distillers and craft industry actors, fieldwork at craft distilleries and state alcohol commission meetings, and the content of company materials, we explore how, and, with what consequence, distillers account for and respond to the obstacles associated with authenticity. In navigating internal and external constraints, distillers are forced to make accommodations that comply with consumer expectations and regulatory policies. As we show, assumptions about authenticity and craft as “good” inhibit craft distillers’ creativity and hamper their ability to express an authentic identity on their own terms.
While aggregate, national measures of wellbeing may be useful for developing national policies and making international comparisons, they are less helpful when it comes to the more prosaic matter of developing policies at the project or programme level. This is because wellbeing is multi-dimensional and variable in terms of the relative importance of domains, the attributes and indicators used to evaluate domains, and the relative importance of those attributes and indicators. Consequently, people’s preferences regarding the trade-offs that must be made between domains, and between attributes within domains, are exceptionally diverse. We use an idiographic approach, Judgement Analysis, to quantify people’s preferences regarding trade-offs within, and between, well-being domains using green space, water quality, cultural identity, social connectedness. We show that Judgement Analysis has the potential at the programme or project scale to usefully quantify differences in the relative importance people place on well-being domains and to quantifying differences in the relative importance of the cues they use to evaluate well-being with respect to a domain. Our results make explicit the extensive diversity in people’s perspectives on well-being that is often hidden in the popular nomothetic approaches to measuring well-being.
BackgroundPrevious researches have reported the relationship between uric acid and cardiovascular disease. We aimed to investigate the association of Life’s Essential 8, a recently updated measurement of cardiovascular health, with the prevalence of hyperuricemia (HUA) and gout among US adults. Additionally, we also explored the relationship between LE8 and all-cause mortality among patients with HUA or gout.MethodsParticipants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2007–2016 were involved in this study. LE8 score was categorized into low, moderate, high CVH groups according to American Heart Association definitions. Multivariable logistic regression and cox regression analyses, restricted cubic spline models, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the associations.ResultsA total of 23,619 adult participants were included in this study, which included 4,775 hyperuricemia patients and 1,055 gout patients. Among all participants, the overall median LE8 score was 65.62 (21.25) and the prevalence of hyperuricemia and gout of were 20.2% and 4.5%, respectively. After fully adjusted the potential confounders, participants in high CVH group had a lower prevalence of hyperuricemia and gout compared with the low CVH group, with a OR (95%CI) of 0.50 (0.39–0.63) and 0.50 (0.30–0.82), respectively. The restricted cubic spline showed a significantly inverse relationship between LE8 and hyperuricemia and gout. Similar patterns were also identified in the association between LE8 scores and all-cause mortality in HUA and gout patients.ConclusionsHigher LE8 scores are associated with lower risk and lower all-cause mortality of HUA and gout among US adults. Adherence to optimal CVH metrics may be an appropriate prevention and management strategy for reducing the socioeconomic burden of hyperuricemia and gout.
BackgroundAsthma is a leading cause of pediatric hospitalization and morbidity, necessitating the development of educational interventions for its management and control.ObjectiveTo evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention in promoting parent/caregiver self-efficacy in the management and control of their children’s asthma.MethodsA clinical trial was conducted in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil, involving two randomized groups of parents/caregivers of children: the comparison group (CG) (n= 42) and the intervention group (IG) (n= 42). Data collection took place in two phases: the first included face-to-face sessions followed by the educational intervention in the IG, and the second included telephone follow-up. The educational intervention included the use of an educational booklet and a brief motivational interview.ResultsThe groups were homogeneous at baseline. After the intervention, the mean self-efficacy scores of the IG were significantly higher than those of the CG (p< 0.05), and children whose parents/caregivers were in the CG were 1.43 times more likely to experience an asthma crisis than those in the IG.ConclusionsThe educational intervention proved effective in increasing parent/caregiver self-efficacy in asthma management and control. Furthermore, children whose parents/caregivers did not receive the educational intervention were more likely to experience an asthma crisis.
PurposeThis study aimed to identify feasible, evidence-based strategies to improve the use of Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) implemented in clinical oncology practice.MethodsA mixed-method study involving observations of consultations and semi-structured interviews with patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) was conducted to identify facilitators and barriers for using PROMs; barriers and facilitators were structured following the Theoretical Domains Framework. For each barrier, evidence-based improvement strategies were selected using the Behaviour Change Techniques Taxonomy v1. Subsequently, improvement strategies were ranked on priority and feasibility by an expert panel of HCPs, information technology professionals, and PROMs implementation specialists, creating an implementation improvement strategy.ResultsTen consultations were observed and 14 interviews conducted. Barriers for implementation included that the electronic health record and PROMs did not align to the individual needs of end users, the HCPs’ hesitance to advice patients about health-related quality-of-life issues, and a lack of consensus on which HCPs were responsible for discussing PROMs with patients. Forty-one improvement strategies were identified, of which 25 remained after ranking. These included: redesigning the PROMs dashboard by including patient management advice, enhancing patient support to complete PROMs, and clarifying HCPs’ responsibilities for discussing PROMs. Strategies currently considered less feasible were: improving user-friendliness of the patient portal due to technical constraints, aligning PROMs assessment frequency with clinical courses, and using baseline PROMs for early identification of vulnerabilities and supportive care needs. These will be studied in future research.ConclusionEvidence-based improvement strategies to ensure lasting adoption of PROMs in clinical practice were identified.
This study aimed to identify factors that affect the health behaviors of married immigrant women and Korean husbands towards their young children. Our cross-sectional descriptive study included 169 married immigrant women and 143 Korean husbands. Data were collected through self-report questionnaires and analyzed using multiple regression, with SPSS/Win 23.0 software. The significant differences between married immigrant women and Korean husbands included parental health behavior towards young children (t = 4.66,p< 0.001), parenting efficacy (t = 3.73,p< 0.001), intercultural adaptation attitudes (t = 4.94,p< 0.001) and family strength (t = 2.52,p= 0.012). Parental health behavior was significantly positively correlated with parenting efficacy, intercultural adaptation attitudes, and family strength, in both married immigrant women and Korean husbands. A multiple regression analysis showed that the factors affecting parental health behavior in married immigrant women were family strength (β = 0.31,p< 0.001) and intercultural adaptation attitudes (β = 0.25,p= 0.002), whereas factors affecting Korean husbands were family strength (β = 0.36,p< 0.001) and parenting efficacy (β = 0.19,p= 0.046). Specifically, the factors that most influenced parental health behavior was family strength, for both married immigrant women and Korean husbands. Considering the results of this study, a family-focused approach is necessary to promote parental health behaviors toward young children in multicultural families. Furthermore, intervention strategies should be implemented to support the intercultural adaptation attitudes of parents in multicultural families and improve the parenting of Korean husbands.
We investigate the effects of hedge accounting usage on firms’ level of capital investment. Analyzing a set of 286 public firms in the European Union during the period 2016–2019, our findings are threefold. Firstly, we provide evidence that firms which apply hedge accounting under IFRS requirements increase their level of capital investment more than firms that do not exploit these accounting principles. Second, we also suggest that this link is mediated by the earnings volatility mitigation. Lastly, we find that such a relationship is exacerbated after the IFRS 9 implementation period, consistently with the view that the newest hedge accounting rules provided by the IASB are recognized to be more effective and more beneficial for firms, comparatively to IAS 39. These results are robust to different measures of capital investment, alternative models’ specifications, and after correcting for potential endogeneity concerns. We contribute with the first empirical study that explores the role of hedge accounting on investment behavior under different IFRS requirements. This research is valuable for standard setters and regulators to understand how their accounting requirements may affect firms’ economic decisions. From a managerial point of view, our study offers particular insights into hedge accounting mechanisms and practical implications about the role of accounting choices in real investments’ decision-making.
In this article, I present the individual ethnography of Amina, a Senegalese woman possessed by the spirits of her lineage. Amina's story shows the lacerations of a person who simultaneously inhabits two worlds: the traditional Lebou culture and the Western one. When her spirits manifest themselves, she is forced to choose between two different interpretations of her suffering: the traditional persecutory and the Western psychopathological. She chooses the former but refuses the healers imposed by the tradition and turns to a priest of her choice, who proves to be sensitive to her need to personally own the healing journey. Amina strategically manipulates the plasticity of the traditional belief system without abandoning it; she bends it to shake the boundaries of herself, and her group and lineage. She uses the disruptive potential of possession and the irruption of the invisible world in the visible to renegotiate her role and acquire a new status in her group. She uses the performative dispositive of possession to renegotiate and expand her spaces of agency and affirm her tenacious subjectivity of a permanently liminal person, one who inhabits, shakes and redraws the boundaries between different worlds of meaning.
While the cultivation of hope has been shown to promote different positive outcomes, few studies have examined how positive and negative affect may affect the receptivity of hope cultivation. The present study examined how initial affective states influence the receptivity of hope cultivation on the promotion of hope and the effectiveness of a self-administered three-week online hope intervention. A total of 60 participants were recruited and they were randomly assigned to either the hope condition or the control condition. Participants in the hope condition received a link that directed them to read the hope relevant materials for four consecutive days per week for three weeks via WhatsApp. Participants in the control condition did not receive any intervention. All participants were asked to complete a pre- and post-assessment on their levels of hope, well-being, and optimism. In addition, they were also asked to complete an assessment of their hope levels in week 1 and week 2. Results showed that the hope cultivation was effective in promoting levels of hope and optimism at post-assessment. While baseline negative affect showed non-significant moderating effect, baseline positive effect moderated the effect of hope intervention on changes of hope in week 2 and post-assessment. In particular, only people with lower levels of positive affect were receptive to the intervention by showing improvement in hope levels. Findings provided evidence in supporting the self-administered online intervention in the promotion of hope.
This study examines the phenomena of complex threat syndrome (CTS) in the Sahel from the standpoint of the increasing dysfunctionality of the states in this area. The study posits that the CTS in the Sahel reflects the logic of a conflict-crime-terror conundrum in the context of rising state fragility. The crisis of legitimacy and governability in the Sahel, instantiated by the weaknesses of the states to facilitate governance, security, and development effectively and sustainably, has brought about conditions that exacerbate anti-state militantism and extremism. The inability of governments to demonstrate requisite competencies in the face of these threats bolsters and reproduces widespread criminal indulgence, impunity, and opportunism. Critical indicators of this include rising jihadist insurgencies, banditry, communal conflicts, and other forms of violence. The consequence has been a complex threat situation where violent conflicts and crimes reinforce each other to engender an enduring climate of insecurity and crisis. Mitigating such a complex security scenario requires a deliberate effort by the authorities in the Sahel to optimize statecraft through effective state-building, security governance reforms, and functional state-society synergy.
This paper examines how forced migrants integrate individual perception, interpersonal exchange, and extended networks to navigate the naturalization process. By bringing together these three methods of knowledge creation and exchange, we aim to clarify how these strategies interact and overlap to manage uncertainties stemming from naturalization bureaucracy, a complex and often opaque process. Drawing on personal accounts of 30 Syrians in Berlin and analysis of approximately 100 social media posts, our findings illustrate that these methods could be employed concurrently or interchangeably and on the whole in a symbiotic manner, offering migrants multiple pathways to acquire and (in)validate crucial information. Although this synthesis of knowledge production methods is not necessarily conducive to accessing the right in question, in our case naturalization, it becomes necessary to arrive at “informed” decision-making in uncertain environments characterized by low level of trust and asymmetrical power relations. The paper therefore contributes to broader discussions on migrants’ navigation of legal systems and coping mechanisms in the face of bureaucratic hurdles.
This study examines the relationship between fintech development and corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance in Southeast Asia. The effectiveness of ESG practices in achieving corporate sustainability is widely discussed, but the specific impact of fintech development on ESG performance in the Southeast Asia region remains unexplored. To determine the relationship between variables, we employed a fixed effects model. The research findings indicate that firms operating in highly developed fintech cities tend to exhibit better ESG performance. After model treatment through utilizing Generalized Least Square for treatment of heteroskedasticity and cross section dependence, the results further emphasize that firms that are located in a high-level of fintech development cities with high level of capitalization demonstrate stronger ESG performance. However, other elements such as growth, leverage, profitability and cashflow do not seem to have an effect on ESG performance based on the results of the model. These factors contribute to the overall effectiveness of corporate sustainability initiatives. Additionally, heterogeneity analysis reveals that the influence of fintech development on ESG performance is consistent across both large and small firms operating in high-tech industries. In other words, this emphasizes fintech development’s role in promoting sustainable social and economic development, regardless of size or industry. These findings offer new insights into the significance of fintech development in driving sustainable practices and advancing social and economic progress. By understanding the interplay between fintech and ESG performance, policymakers and businesses can make informed decisions to foster sustainable development in Southeast Asia.
ObjectivesBeginning in February 2022, the United States faced an infant formula shortage that severely impacted access and affordability. Little is known about how this shortage impacted infant feeding intentions among expectant mothers. Our study sought to determine the impact of the formula shortage on prenatal feeding intentions and to understand expectant mothers’ feelings and perceived stress related to the shortage.MethodsThis cross-sectional, exploratory, observational study of pregnant women (n = 57) residing in New York City utilized a self-administered online survey in May–July 2022.ResultsThe results indicate that ten (17.5%) respondents changed their feeding intentions during the infant formula shortage for months 0–3 or 3–6 of infancy to include more breastfeeding than originally intended. These mothers also reported significantly higher stress levels related to the shortage than their non-changing peers.Conclusions for practiceOur results suggest that the formula shortage influenced feeding intentions among a subset of surveyed expectant mothers. The stress associated with the shortage influenced prenatal feeding intentions to include more breastfeeding than intended prior to the shortage. Prenatal healthcare providers should consider the availability of infant formula as one of myriad factors that influence infant feeding intentions, and that the stress associated with whether infant formula is readily available may influence these intentions as well.
Although leadership studies have highlighted the importance of ethical conduct, scholarship on this topic has generally treated ethical leadership in a decontextualized, individualist and isolated manner. The purpose of this article is to review the literature to develop an integrative framework that conceptualizes ethical leadership as a dynamic process, wherein individual traits of leaders, organizational contexts and systematic practices are mutually reinforcing and evolving. The article also outlines an agenda for future researchers to systematically examine and implement ethical leadership in real-world settings.
This study explores the impact of integrating social-emotional learning (SEL) into teacher training programs through children’s literature on the knowledge and attitudes of preservice teachers towards SEL. The research involved creating SEL-themed tote bags, developing lesson plans, and participating in an SEL book reading session to prepare future PreK-4 teachers to nurture essential SEL competencies for academic success. The research used convenience sampling to select undergraduate students in Early Childhood and Elementary Education courses for interviews. The findings provide valuable insights into how preservice teachers’ knowledge and attitudes shift towards the implementation of SEL activities in their future classrooms.
This study develops and tests a model of subjective indicators of national wellbeing that can be applied across countries worldwide. Using data from over 160,000 respondents in 137 countries from the 2019 Gallup World Poll, we examine how citizens’ satisfaction with national institutions and various environments (physical, political, economic, and social) affects their subjective wellbeing. Based on bottom-up spillover theory, we hypothesize that satisfaction with concrete country conditions affects overall life satisfaction and affective wellbeing. Results from Bayesian multilevel modeling support our hypotheses and show significant positive relationships between citizens’ satisfaction with national institutions, political, economic, and social environments and their subjective well-being. Satisfaction with the physical environment showed no significant effect in the full model but was significant when analyzed separately. This research provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the factors that influence national wellbeing in different global contexts and offers fresh insights for policymakers and researchers in assessing and improving quality of life at the national level.
Despite centuries of scientific (and sometimes pseudoscientific) interest in identifying criminals, research has not examined the perception and punishment of female criminals. Building on research describing how men’s facial appearance relates to juridic outcomes, we therefore investigated criminality inferences, their underlying cues, and hypothetical sentencing judgments from photos of female criminals. Participants categorized violent and nonviolent criminals significantly better than chance (Study 1) and aggression perceptions explained that detection (Study 2). Moreover, women who looked more aggressive received more severe hypothetical (Study 3a) and actual (Study 3b) sentences. Women’s facial appearance may therefore play an unintended and incidental role in perceptions of their criminality, illustrating how kernels of truth in social perception promote biases resulting from overgeneralization effects.
The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Pennsylvania’s state-wide intensive in-home treatment for youth with serious emotional disturbance (SED), EcoSystemic Structural Family Therapy-Family Based Mental Health Services (ESFT-FBMHS). Despite its long history of implementation, the program remains empirically under-evaluated. In this archival study, out-of-home placement and youth functioning outcomes were compared across four tiers of length of stay. Given the high-risk population treated in ESFT-FBMHS, it was hypothesized that the families and youth who completed the full duration of treatment (169–224 days) would have better outcomes than those who stopped treatment after 168 days or less. We utilized an ex post facto quantitative research design analyzing archived medical claims data of 2251 youth treated between 2018 and 2022 to assess out-of-home placement rates and analyzed archived data from six domains of the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS; Problem Presentation, Risk Behaviors, Functioning, Child Safety, Caregiver Needs, and Child Strengths) to assess changes in youth functioning post-discharge (90 and 180 days). An analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEE), controlling for potential confounding variables such as demographics and clinical features, suggest that length of stay in ESFT-FBMHS was significantly associated with out-of-home placement and youth improvement on the CANS at both 90- and 180-days post-discharge. As a group, youth with SED who did not complete the full duration of the program had 2–3 times the odds of out-of-home placement at 90 days post-discharge and 1–3 times the odds at 180 days post-discharge as compared to program completers. CANS scores showed improvement in 40.1% of youth who completed the program as compared to only 11.7%–18.2% for those who did not. The results of this study suggest that ESFT-FBMHS is effective for youth with SED as a group and can improve youth functioning and reduce out-of-home placement.
ObjectivesMaternal mortality remains an unfinished global agenda and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) remains one of the leading causes. The aims of this study were to describe the incidence, underlying causes, and case fatality rate of PPH in public hospitals in eastern Ethiopia.MethodsThis study was part of a larger Ethiopian Obstetric Surveillance System (EthOSS) project — a multicenter surveillance of women admitted to 13 public hospitals in eastern Ethiopia due to any of the five major obstetric conditions: obstetric hemorrhage, eclampsia, uterine rupture, sepsis, and severe anemia – conducted from April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022. All registers in maternity units of those hospitals were reviewed to identify eligible women and collect data on sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics, management and maternal outcomes at discharge or death. Findings were reported using descriptive statistics.ResultsAmong 38,782 births registered during the study period, 2043 women were admitted with at least one of the five major obstetric conditions. Of these 2043, 306 women (15%) had PPH corresponding with an incidence rate of 8 (95% CI: 7–9) per 1000 births. Uterine atony was the main underlying cause in 77%; 81% of women with PPH received at least one uterotonic drug, and 72% of women for whom blood was requested received at least one unit. Of the 70 hospital based maternal deaths, 19 (27%) died from PPH, making a case fatality rate of 6 per 100.ConclusionsAlthough the overall incidence of PPH appeared low, it was still the underlying cause of death in one out of four women who died. The contributing factors might be that one in five women with PPH did not receive any uterotonic drug and the low blood transfusion. Ongoing audit, followed by targeted action, is essential to improve care quality and reduce adverse maternal outcome. The relatively low incidence may reflect under-recording in paper-based records, implying that further research into methods to optimize the surveillance is needed.
Objectification of women is heightened during the reproductive years and is associated with a myriad of adverse outcomes. Yet, little research has examined the impact of self-objectification among postpartum women and whether potential effects can be ameliorated. The current study investigated the association between self-objectification and well-being among women who had given birth in the last three years, and whether self-compassion moderated or mediated the link. As hypothesized, women (N= 162) higher in self-objectification reported greater body shame, appearance anxiety, depressive symptoms, and disordered eating, and lower life satisfaction, self-esteem, and more negative experience being a mother, whereas women higher in self-compassion reported more positive outcomes on these measures. Self-compassion mediated the association between self-objectification and poorer well-being on most outcomes. Unexpectedly, neither self-objectification nor self-compassion were associated with sexual dysfunction or breastfeeding confidence. The findings suggest that although women might be prone to self-objectification and body shame during the postpartum period, self-compassion explains this relation and potentially holds promise for disrupting negative experiences during the transition to motherhood.
The prevalence of early childhood expulsion has been documented for close to two decades, with known disparities for children of color, children with disabilities, and children who have experienced trauma. While empirical data on the lasting impact of early expulsion events continues to emerge, there has been little research focused explicitly on how expulsion impacts caregivers (inclusive of any adult that sees themselves in a primary caretaker role for a young child that had experienced expulsion, such as mothers, fathers, grandparents, and foster parents). The purpose of this research study was to examine the experiences of caregivers of young children who experienced expulsion from an early childhood setting. We used a semi-structured interview to capture caregivers’ experiences pre and post expulsion (N= 26). We used a multi-step, collaborative analysis process to analyze the interview data using thematic and constant comparative methods. Initially, most caregivers reported a positive association with their children’s early education setting. However, despite a positive start, relationships with staff deteriorated, and eventually their children were expelled. In most incidents, caregivers described feeling caught off guard by these expulsions, with lasting negative impact for their family. Implications for research and policy are discussed.
Latinos form the largest ethnic population in the United States (18.5%), and the majority  are Mexican Americans (61.4%). Many Mexican Americans have unique dietary behaviors, yet few food frequency questionnaires explicitly define Mexican American diets. The objective of this work was to engage with a population of rural Mexican Americans to develop a Mexican American food frequency questionnaire. Because acculturation is linked to dietary intake, we also examined acculturation by diet. We used mixed methods with three phases: (1) a qualitative phase in which a sample of rural Mexican-Americans (N = 15) identified and provided rich data about foods they ate; (2) a developmental phase in which 4 day food records  were completed sequentially by two new and different samples of Mexican Americans (N = 19); and 3) a preliminary assessment phase where a new sample of Mexican Americans (N = 49) completed the final food frequency questionnaire. The final questionnaire included many traditional Mexican foods and beverages identified by study participants as part of their typical diet. Traditional Mexican foods and beverages were consumed regularly; little variation in diet was seen by level of acculturation. Respondents perceived diets containing commercial sugar-sweetened beverages as unhealthful, but not those with traditional Mexican drinks, which may represent an unappreciated source of added sugar in the diet. Future work includes studies examining dietary patterns in other urban and rural communities with traditional Mexican diets.
Using an interdisciplinary, empirical perspective, the study explored Orthodox Christians’ perceptions of self-love and its relationship to love of neighbour, love of God and self-sacrifice. Three scales with good reliability were designed and used with 153 Orthodox Christian adults. The main results obtained are as follows: Orthodox Christians have positive perceptions of self-love – they do not see it as a passion or sin as it is described in Christian ascetic literature; they appreciate the importance and benefits of self-love when they perceive it as a separate reality from the love of neighbour and the love of God; some of them have negative or unclear perceptions on the relationship between self-love, love of neighbour and love of God. In this last respect the empirical results of the study contradict important philosophical and theological views. In the study, less than one-quarter of the Orthodox Christians scored high in practising healthy self-love and agreed that self-love can coexist with self-sacrifice in a certain dose or balance. The clinical and pastoral implications of the findings are discussed, and practical suggestions for intervention are proposed.
This article introduces a theory of societalized politics to investigate crisis events in the German civil sphere between 2015 and 2024, and to proffer an answer to the disputed question of the preconditions that facilitated the rapid rise of right-wing populism in the German context. Drawing on civil sphere and societalization theory, the article specifies the foundational cultural elements, or binary cultural codes (BCCs), upon which German political elites crafted meso-level narratives to contest and manage strains in the civil sphere. Through an analysis of communicative and regulative institutions’ responses to the arrival of refugees in 2015, and the publication of the Correctiv.org report and the backlash protests it inspired in 2024, the article charts the rise of the far-right partyAlternative für Deutschland(AfD), and explains its success as due in part to its leaders’ capacities to represent themselves and their supporters as embodying the BCC’s civil democratic signifiers. Introducing a theory of societalized politics, the analysis demonstrates a processual approach to the construction and contesting of crisis events that emerge within the civil sphere itself. The article also introduces a civil sphere theory of right-wing populism, which frames the phenomenon as the elevation of nativist, primordial signifiers born foremost of the noncivil spheres of ethnicity and religion. It concludes by arguing that while the German civil sphere is in flux, the post-Potsdam civil protests indicate a significant portion of the nation’s publics remain committed to universalistic, civil democratic principles.
Apart from polarized feminist theorizing, which is abundant in the literature, much of the scholarship on sex work is atheoretical and based on single-case studies. This paper argues that theorization can be advanced by systematic comparison of multiple settings and types of prostitution at the structural, interactional, and experiential levels. I show that certain structural and interactional characteristics, specific to each sector, can be linked to corresponding patterns in participants’ routine or modal experiences and meanings. Drawing on the empirical literature, I show that some of the most important meanings revolve around the degree to which a sector is conducive to rebranding and decommodification by participants, bordering on normalization. In the sociology of deviance, this is known as norm “neutralization” and “deviance disavowal.” It is argued that the social organization of one of the sectors is most favorable to destigmatization by the actors involved.
Engagement with institutions from migrants’ country of origin, both in the destination country and in the country of origin, is distinct transnational behaviour. This study investigates the impact of geographical distance on the institutional engagement of migrants from Czechia in five global regions. We examine how geographic (physical) proximity to Czechia shapes institutional engagement with the country of origin and identify factors beyond distance influencing institutional engagement. We analyzed survey data from Czech emigrants (N= 940) in neighbouring countries, Western and Northern Europe, Southern and Eastern Europe, overseas Anglo-Saxon countries, and other countries. We found that respondents from all more distant regions have higher levels of institutional engagement in the destination country than those from neighbouring countries. Length of stay and education were relevant factors for all selected regions, while place of residence (living in a metropolis) and the level of transnational behavior had varying impacts across regions. Concerning institutional engagement in origin country, the level of transnationalism was consistently the strongest predictor across. Transnational studies should incorporate geographic variables, such as physical distance into their conceptual frameworks. We expect our findings to be generalizable to other countries similar to Czechia, i.e. high-income countries whose citizens benefit from liberal visa regimes.
This article recounts the stories of Afghan migrants who have returned from Iran to Afghanistan. I frame these accounts of ordinary Afghans’ life experiences as “narratives of pride,” juxtaposing these stories with narratives of victimhood that dominate the immigration discourse on Afghanistan and more generally. In these narratives, migrants are predominantly characterized as victims in need of being saved. This article instead asks: why do returnees from Iran focus mostly on the positive parts of their mobility while downplaying the difficulties of dealing with the Iranian state, which does not have a good track record of dealing with migrants? In telling stories of years of living and working in Iran or other countries, I find that my interlocutors characterize themselves as sophisticated men of the world with a deep understanding of social and political phenomena that give them the ability to navigate life in foreign lands—an image far from victimhood as it is commonly portrayed in the literature and media. The article argues that in order to better understand the agency of migrants, it is crucial to form long-term connections with them to gain a more nuanced understanding of their experiences, rather than simply reproducing stories of victimhood.
Chaplains can play a unique role in providing care for trans and gender-diverse (TGD) people by addressing their spiritual needs. However, spiritual care for TGD individuals may fail to be inclusive in at least three ways: spiritual care may focus solely on religious TGD people, on a limited part of the whole range of gender identities, or on a specific route toward gender affirmation. In this article, the aim is to develop an inclusive perspective on spiritual care for TGD people. To that end, inspired by work by Susan Sontag, we examine spiritual care for TGD individuals through the philosophical lens of social imaginaries, focussing particularly on metaphors, tracing how metaphors used in care for TGD people have changed over time. We elaborate on the potential of the metaphor of “orientation in gender-expansive space,” based on queer theory and literature about worldview-inclusive chaplaincy,for envisioning an inclusive approach to gender-affirming spiritual care.
This paper explores the intricate interplay between living with mental illness and the processes of identifying mental illness in Abeokuta, Nigeria. With a particular focus on the contextual understanding of personhood, this study reveals how sociocultural backgrounds modulate the understanding of mental illness and its treatments within the Yoruba context. Through nine months of ethnographic fieldwork and discursive narrative analysis, the research revealed that becoming a mentally ill person is deeply intertwined with the everyday social life in the study site. The analysis highlights the multifaceted nature of personhood, encompassing various aspects such as parenthood, friendship, employment, and financial freedom. These facets of personhood are shaped by specific social practices and embedded within complex webs of social relations, often becoming more pronounced when these relationships are disrupted, leading to certain behaviours being categorised as mental illness. This paper underscores the significance of recognising and acknowledging the contextual notion and understanding of mental illness to ensure the provision of acceptable and effective care and recovery strategies.
Young autistic children and their siblings often need support to play and engage with each other. The inclusion of older siblings in the provision of support may improve outcomes for autistic children and strengthen the sibling relationship. This study evaluated the inclusion of older siblings in the delivery of Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) support to autistic children aged between 3 and 4 years. It used a non-concurrent multiple baseline across participants design to evaluate the effects of sibling-mediated ESDM for four young autistic children and their older, non-autistic siblings. For most dyads, there were improvements in autistic child engagement and in sibling initiations during the sibling-mediated ESDM, which were generally maintained at follow-up. There was some improvement in sibling responses and minimal improvement in autistic child imitation and functional utterances. Sibling initiations and responses were generally positively correlated with autistic child engagement, functional utterances, and imitation. The parents of children in all four dyads found the sibling-mediated ESDM to be acceptable. These preliminary results suggest that sibling-mediated ESDM may be beneficial for improving the interaction between autistic children and their non-autistic siblings while benefits for teaching additional child skills might be more limited.
Immigrant integration is a complicated phenomenon where multiple factors (e.g., language, ethnicity, culture, population, and geographical location) can play significant role(s) in how immigrants settle and integrate in host communities and the type of integration (broader or bounded) that takes place at the social level. This requires investigating integration patterns of immigrants from a heterogenous perspective where integration is understood as a complex, multidirectional, and multidimensional practice, and special attention is paid to the issues of language, culture, and ethnicity. Taking this perspective to do a case study of a sub-group of South Asians from Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, this study reports findings from 19 interviews with participants who may live or work in an ethnically concentrated area (i.e., Northeast of Calgary). In addition to reporting multilingual communicative practices across the four dimensions of integration outlined by the Canadian Index for Measuring Integration (CIMI) (i.e., economic, social, political, and health), data analysis identified two dominant integration patterns:nested-broader integrationandnested-selective integration. These patterns describe the lingo-ethnic factors that impact South Asians’ socio-politico-economic and health integration in Alberta and may have implications for the Albertan and Canadian society in the long run.
Much research has focused on the role of the alt-right in pushing far-right narratives into mainstream discourse. In this work, we focus on the alt-right’s effects on extremist narratives themselves. From 2012 to 2017, we find a rise in alt-right, 4chan-like discourse styles across multiple communication platforms known for white supremacist extremism, such as Stormfront. This discourse style incorporates inflammatory insults, irreverent comments, and talk about memes and online “chan” culture itself. A network analysis of one far-right extremist platform suggests that central users adopt and spread this alt-right style. This analysis has implications for understanding influence and change in online white supremacist extremism, as well as the role of style in white supremacist communications.Warning: This paper contains examples of hateful and offensive language.
Prior studies show a heightened risk of child maltreatment during the COVID-19 pandemic because of financial difficulties and parenting stress, but little is known about what happened to the veteran families. This study aimed to examine the influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on veteran parents’ harsh parenting – creating a potential for child maltreatment. Further, we explored the potential moderating effects of parental PTSD and parental role on the association between COVID-19 impacts and veteran harsh parenting. We recruited 509 veteran parents from Qualtrics online research panel and assessed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., perceived threat, financial and psychological impacts) on the participants, parental PTSD, and parents’ past year prevalence of corporal punishment and psychological aggression. We used Mplus8.8 to build main models, two-way moderation models, and three-way moderation models. There was a significant association between COVID-19 pandemic impacts and harsh parenting (Corporal punishment:β= 0.09,p< 0.05; Psychological aggression:β= 0.10,p< 0.05), while parental PTSD was a significant moderator (Corporal punishment:β= 0.10,p< 0.05; Psychological aggression:β= 0.08,p< 0.05). Parents with higher levels of PTSD were more vulnerable to the negative influences of COVID-19 on their harsh parenting. However, the association between COVID-19 pandemic impacts and harsh parenting did not differ by parental role. Our study findings contribute to the current knowledge of veteran families during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide implications for both Veteran Affairs services and child protective services.
Social outcomes from conservation and development activities on a local scale are often assessed using five livelihood assets—Natural, Physical, Human, Financial and Social—and their associated indicators. These indicators, and the variables used to measure them, are typically based on ‘common practice’ with limited attention being paid to the use of alternative indicators. In this article, we present a typical survey of socioeconomic benefits for ecological restoration workers in South Africa, and ask whether the common livelihood indicators used are adequate and sufficient, or whether any relevant indicators are missing. Results from the livelihood survey show the value of income, food and education as strong indicators of financial and human assets, and the importance of open-ended questions in eliciting details of workers’ perceived changes in their livelihoods. However, by complementing the survey results with qualitative data from semi-structured interviews and stakeholder workshops, we show how unconventional livelihood indicators and aspects provide a deeper understanding of changes in livelihoods that are tied to restoration projects. We guide scholars and practitioners to advance their process of selecting livelihood indicators, in particular to include three additional types of indicators: intangible indicators to assess life quality; relative indicators reaching across spatial and temporal scales to capture community outcomes and livelihood resilience; and, political indicators to uncover causal relationships.
This paper uses the China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS) in 2017 to investigate the relationship between inter-city tier migration and health and explores the mechanism and heterogeneity. The results show that migration from low-tier to higher-tier cities positively correlates with health, and the greater the span between the city tiers of inflow and outflow, the better the health. The revenue effect and institutional effect are mediating factors related to upward migration and health, and the mediating role of the institutional effect is more potent than that of the revenue effect. There is intergenerational heterogeneity between the revenue effect and the institutional effect. Among the old generation of migrants, the explanatory power of the institutional effect is stronger than the revenue effect, while the revenue effect and the institutional effect have similar roles among the new generation of migrants. This study suggests that migrating to high-tier cities protects health status through revenue and institutional effects. However, with the intergenerational replacement of migrants, the mediating factors for maintaining good health in high-tier cities that migrants rely on will change.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, national policymakers implemented many public health social measures to cease the spread of the disease, while, those interventions also affected population health behaviors, including drinking alcohol. We analyzed national survey data of 7731 respondents to investigate drinking behavioral patterns, as well as measure the strength of association between social measures and alcohol consumption among the Thai populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We demonstrated that perceptions on temporary suspension of entertainment events and a ban on alcohol sales during the pandemic were significantly associated with alcohol consumption behaviors. Specifically, the negative perceptions of these social measures were associated with the increase of drinking: OR = 1.42; 95% CI = [1.19, 1.69] and OR = 2.50; 95% CI = [2.11, 2.97], respectively. We recommended to assess the long-term effects of targeted social measures on drinking behavior, especially the post pandemic.
PurposeBreast cancer (BC) screening enables early detection of BC, which may lead to improved quality of life (QoL). We aim to compare QoL between women with a screen-detected and clinically detected BC in the Netherlands.MethodsWe used data from the ‘Utrecht cohort for Multiple BREast cancer intervention studies and Long-term evaluation’ (UMBRELLA) between October 2013 and March 2022. Patients were categorized as screen-detected or clinically detected. We analysed three questionnaires, namely EORTC QLQ C-30, BR23, and HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) completed by BC patients shortly after diagnosis (T1) and one-year after treatment (T2). Independent t-tests were performed to compare QoL average differences between the two groups. Bonferroni-correctedp-value significance threshold of 0.00057 was used. The magnitude of differences was calculated using Cohen’sd. The clinical relevance of QLQ-C30 differences was assessed based on interpretation guideline of EORTC-QLQ-C30 results.ResultsAfter applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, there were 691 women with screen-detected BC and 480 with clinically detected BC. Generally, screen-detected BC patients reported a better QoL. At T1, their average QLQ-C30 summary score was higher (86.1) than clinically detected BC patients (83.0) (p< 0.0001). Cohen’sdfor all items ranged between 0.00 and 0.39. A few QLQ-C30 score differences were clinically relevant, indicating better outcomes in emotional functioning, general health, constipation, and fatigue for women with screen-detected BC.ConclusionsIn the Netherlands, women with screen-detected BC reported statistically significant and better QoL than women with clinically detected BC. However, clinical relevance of the differences is limited.
The Nordic welfare states are considered advanced in terms of gender equality, but even in these countries women still take longer family leave and have lower earnings than men. This study provides new insights by assessing the differences in accumulated midlife earnings associated with childbearing between women and men in Finland and Sweden. We pay particular attention to the size of the gender gap in accumulated earnings across groups. We hypothesize that the gender gap will be larger among those with a larger number of children, among those with a lower level of education, and overall in Finland. The study is based on complete population register data, with highly accurate measures of earnings over decades. Our results show that by the age of 44, women born in 1974–1975 in Finland and Sweden had earned on average 32% and 29% less than men, respectively. Childbearing strongly modifies the gender gap, especially in Finland, and the highly educated have moderately smaller gaps in both countries. Our results show that, even the Nordic welfare states, despite their strong policy emphasis on gender equality and their success in achieving high levels of female labor force participation, are far from closing the gender gap in earnings accumulated over the first half of the life course. Our results also suggest that governments seeking to achieve gender equality should be cautious about providing long family-related leave with flat-rate compensation.
Millions of young children attend childcare settings in the United States and the quality of these early childhood settings, such as the activities children engage in and how teachers interact with children, matter for children’s development. This study was designed to test the impacts of a tech-enabled observation and feedback system focused on quality practices in early childcare. A randomized trial of 46 childcare professionals using items from a new observational quality tool outlining specific EBP, Brief Early Childhood Quality Inventory (BEQI), in Nebraska, was conducted. Treatment and control groups were observed virtually for 90 min by trained observers and received results from their observations on a set of evidence-based practices (EBP), such as engaging children in conversations about feelings and reading books. Treatment group participants then engaged in goal setting for EBP and received text-based messages for 12 weeks, while control group members only received observation results. Results indicated that treatment group members were significantly more likely to increase EBP that were targeted for change over the course of 12 weeks, with 62% showing improvement on two or more target EBP, whereas only 21% of the control group showed improvement on two or more target EBP. 70% of treatment group members agreed that the program was beneficial for the children in their care, and 73% would recommend the program to another childcare professional. Providing feedback to educators based on a simple observational tool can help promote adoption of EBP in childcare settings, with positive effects of an intervention focused on goal setting and support for specific practices through text messaging.
Several studies have demonstrated the importance of racial resentment and sexism in voting in the 2016 election. While this could be primarily a function of the particular electoral context, this study takes a broader look at a potential link between racist and sexist attitudes. At least since the election of Barack Obama, racial resentment has been found to increasingly correlate with a range of political views. But, we do not yet know whether this connection applies to gendered attitudes as well. Using American National Election Studies (ANES) data spanning five presidential election cycles (2004–2020), we explore whether racial and gendered views are correlated. Specifically, we examine the connection between racial resentment and three distinct gendered attitudes, including traditional gender roles, modern sexism, and beliefs about gender discrimination. We test two possibilities: whether a link between these views emerges as the result of racial priming by elites, consistent with “racial spillover,” or if racist and sexist attitudes are connected as part of the same underlying, system-justifying framework, meaning that this relationship endures over time, predating Obama’s 2008 election. We find strong evidence that, throughout the period under study, racial resentment is associated with all three gendered attitudes and appears to be part of a more comprehensive worldview rather than simply a “spillover” effect. Our analysis suggests that scholars should do more to examine the underlying attitudinal factors that influence both racism and sexism, as well as the enduring nature of this relationship over time.
Adolescent mental health is considerably influenced by family circumstances, with adversity frequently resulting in detrimental effects. While cumulative risk models theorize the accumulation of risks amplifies harm, recent researchers employing latent class analysis (LCA) seeks to comprehend the impacts of complex risk profiles on youth. However, the use of LCA remains sparse in studies involving Chinese adolescents. This research examined a sample of 2,889 Chinese secondary school students, assessing six family risk factors, namely, parental divorce, parent–child separation, financial hardship, low parental education, diminished family intimacy, and family conflict. The study also deployed indigenous measures to evaluate ten dimensions of mental health. Through LCA, distinct family risk profiles were identified and subsequently analyzed in comparison to mental health indicators utilizing ANOVA tests. The analysis delineated five distinct risk profiles: No Risk, Parental Education Risk, Family Detachment Risk, Family Conflict Risk, and Cumulative Risk. Remarkably, the Family Conflict Risk profile correlated with the most adverse mental health outcomes. Interestingly, parent–child separation appeared to confer certain benefits. Moreover, girls and older adolescents manifested exacerbated symptoms, which were amplified by their interplay with family risks. The study elucidates that specific configurations of family adversity, particularly those revolving around conflict and detachment, have a pronounced impact on the mental well-being of Chinese adolescents, while implying separation from parents potentially offered a protective effect. Consequently, interventions targeted at parents and designed to alleviate destructive family dynamics and encourage healthier relationships can be crucial in promoting mental health outcomes in this demographic.
Recognizing the importance of evidence-based research in informing migration policies and empowering migrant domestic workers (MDWs), this study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of MDW research patterns and trends. Using a descriptive cross-sectional study design, research articles on MDWs were retrieved from the Scopus database. The findings reveal a substantial increase in research output in recent years, with notable contributions from journals in the fields of social sciences and humanities. Key contributors include scholars from the United States, the United Kingdom, and institutions such as theNational University of Singaporeand theChinese University of Hong Kong. Journals in the field of migration have prominent role in publishing research on MDWs. At the author level, Yeoh, B.S.A, at theNational University of Singaporewas the most prolific author. Academic activities were the main driver of research and that funding was suboptimal in this field. Highly cited articles focused on topics such as transnational motherhood, the international division of reproductive labor, and the negotiation of citizenship rights. Major research hotspots in the retrieved articles included mental health aspects, caregiving especially of the elderly, and struggles for legal rights. Specific nationalities, such as Filipina/o and Indonesian MDWs, have been the focus of numerous studies, shedding light on their narratives, challenges, and agency within transnational contexts. Overall, this study underscores the urgency of addressing the needs and rights of MDWs, advocate for human rights, and enhance understanding of occupational health and safety in the unique context of domestic work.
This is the first large-scale comparative study to search for macro-level determinants of the realization of short-term fertility intentions across European countries. Using the unique follow-up feature of the Generations and Gender Survey and adopting rigorous definitions of intentions and outcomes, it reports on the level of fulfilment and finds clear heterogeneity across European countries. Using a multilevel, multivariate approach, it examines the nature of macro-level factors that may explain differences in the realization of fertility intentions. Based on our analysis, we conclude that labour market stability (as measured by fluctuations in the unemployment rate), price stability, heavy welfare state involvement, and the dominance of certain attitudinal conditions all support the greater realization of short-term fertility intentions.
This study aims to analyze Asian marriage migrant women’s  participation in the labor market, focusing on the case of Korean husbands in Korea, who have an interaction effect between resources and couple’s gender role attitudes. Data on 4,610 couples consisting of Asian marriage migrant women and Korean husbands were extracted from the Survey on the Actual Conditions of Multicultural Families (2018). Logistic regression models and average marginal effects were tested. The results indicated that Asian marriage migrant women with high-income husbands who believe in gender egalitarianism have a negative impact on labor market participation, including the interaction effect of resources and gender role attitudes. The findings indicate that traditional gender divisions of labor are deeply rooted among Asian marriage migrant women and Korean husbands.
Genetically informative studies have established a new research field that crosscuts disciplinary boundaries within the social sciences, as well as between social science and biology, with proprietary aims and research questions. This happens, however, at the cost of appropriate integration into the current theoretical and conceptual streams in the social sciences, e.g., sociology. That such a fruitful integration is possible is demonstrated for the case of life course research. The focus in dominantly, though not exclusively, on sociological concepts of the life course. This article first introduces central concepts of genetically informative research and life course research and then discusses possible ways to integrate genetic information into the life course research agenda, giving a brief overview of the main methodological tools available.
A series of personal reflections, springing from a neighborhood talk and exploring the way aging has been approached in literature by Cicero, Montaigne, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Borges, and Neruda. We age from the moment we are born, though we grasp its pathos as death nears.
Comparative school-to-work research has long emphasised the role of institutions in shaping youth labour market integration. This paper provides an overview of this research stream, consisting of four main sections. Thefirstsection introduces a variety of labour market outcomes of young graduates within Europe and identifies country clusters with higher and lower outcomes; this empirical evidence has so far remained limited in the multivariate oriented research stream. Thesecondsection links these labour market outcomes to the institutional settings of the education systems prevalent in the country clusters. By considering a wide country sample, it introduces a reliable country classification of transition regimes (along the OLM–ILM continuum), which has so far been partly inconclusive in research. Thethirdsection links labour market outcomes in turn to labour market institutions of the country clusters. This section emphasizes why labour market institutions drive only particular individual outcomes. Finally, thefourthsection connects the previous three: it describes how certain institutional complementarities affect the youth labour market integration in the identified European country clusters. The review further identifies theoretical inconclusiveness or data-related desiderata, for which recommendations and solutions are proposed. The paper thus aims to assist both familiar and unfamiliar researchers to access the research stream by offering a comprehensive introduction and clear country classifications, linking research streams, and providing solutions to identified issues.
Mothers of children on the autism spectrum cope with numerous difficulties associated with raising a child with a complex disability. Religious belief is perceived as a resource for coping with the difficulty. This study examined the uniqueness of the perception of motherhood among Israeli national-religious and Haredi mothers of children on the autism spectrum ages 10–19 with various levels of function, using 12 semistructured interviews which were analyzed by a full content analysis according to grounded theory. The interviews revealed that the mothers perceived their motherhood as an ongoing process that is accompanied by a journey of self-awareness. The transition from feelings of helplessness, frustration, and guilt to feelings of growth and development from the crisis, as well as movement from total motherhood and attentive motherhood, reflect this process. A dichotomous distinction of motherhood emerged between how the participants related to other mothers of children on the autism spectrum and to mothers of typically developing children. The religious beliefs expressed by the participants touched on coming to terms with reality, belief as an anchor, belief that life invites inner progress, belief in future reward, and belief that their situation is a test from God or, alternatively, a punishment from God. The study contributes to knowledge of perceptions of motherhood by mothers of children on the autism spectrum, unique to national-religious and Haredi mothers in Israel.
Loneliness and depression are serious public mental health problems. Meaning in life (MIL) is associated with reduced loneliness and depression. This study aimed to: (1) investigate associations between loneliness, MIL, and depression, differentiated by sex in individuals aged ≥ 50 years, residing in 26 European countries and Israel, and (2) to examine in men and women separately whether MIL mediated the relationship between loneliness and depression. We included 41,372 individuals (23,789 women) who responded to wave 8 of the SHARE project. The variables analyzed were loneliness (UCLA), depression (EURO-D scale), and MIL (CASP-19). The analytical procedures included regression analysis and exploratory mediation analysis. Among men and women, the odds of loneliness increasing depression were 3.6 and 3.3 times higher, respectively. Among men, feeling MIL sometimes or often had odds for reducing depression by 0.53 and 0.21, respectively. In women, feeling MIL sometimes or frequently reduced the odds of depression by 0.37 and 0.19, respectively. Regardless of sex, mediation analyses showed a positive association between loneliness and depression, while MIL was negatively associated with loneliness and depression. MIL partially mediated the association between LON and depression in male and female models by approximately 83.2% and 80.7%, respectively. No differences were found between men's and women's mediation models. Regardless of sex, high levels of MIL seem to be effective in benefiting the mental health of Europeans aged 50 and over. MIL proved to be a significant mediator of the relationship between loneliness and depression, while loneliness and depression strengthened each other.
Economists’ conceptions about the “nature of the economic agent” are central to understanding their economic thinking, the phenomena that deserve their attention, the way they build models and theories—as well as the scope and relevance of those theories. Moreover, according to the “psychological” traits of the agent, the subsequent economic theory can accommodate (or not) certain economic phenomena. These claims certainly apply to Brian J. Loasby’s economics. The objective of this article is to survey and analyse Loasby’s reconstruction of economics based on the revision of the psychological foundations of economic agent. We show the influence that George A. Kelly, Adam Smith, Alfred Marshall, Friedrich Hayek and Herbert Simon (among others) play in his work. According to Loasby, concepts such as uncertainty, motivation, imagination, and connecting principles, are central to explaining the growth and organization of knowledge, complexity, and the evolution of economic systems.
In this paper I reflect upon soft-systems inquiry. To do this I revisit Churchman’s discourse on the philosophical ideas underpinning inquiring systems and then discuss the practical application of soft inquiry pioneered by Checkland. This body of work suggested ontological models of organisational behavior were inappropriate and only by adopting an epistemological perspective would provide the basis for understanding complex systems that characterise human society. These ideas motivated a new way of addressing complexity. This work created a difficulty for action research since to be faithful to this discovery meant that any method of inquiry should be one that could cope with such complexity. One outcome was Soft Systems Methodology (SSM). Paradoxically the success of SSM has restrained further discussion of these ideas. The purpose of this paper is to revisit the ideas of Churchman and Checkland as a means of returning to first principles. In this paper I reassess their ideas and those of Husserl and Gadamer and suggest there is more to be gained from this rich seam of systems thinking.
This study examines ethnic disparities in the rates of criminal charges, in-out decisions, and sentence length, for persons originating from middle eastern countries, Pakistan, and Turkey (MENAP+T) (n = 24), and all other countries (n = 239), using Danish registry data from 2013-2019. Data consist of a sample of charges (n = 718,775), and a subsample of convictions (n = 286,832) for violence, property offences, and four types of drug offences: trafficking; wholesale; possession; and sale. There are large ethnic disparities in criminal justice outcomes in Denmark. Persons originating from MENAP+T countries had a 6.6 times higher rate of charges for violence, 5.1 for property offences, 5.4 for drug trafficking, 17.1 for drug wholesale, 5.4 for possession, and 7.9 higher rate for sale. Between the drug offence categories, disparities between the country groups are in a similar range for the lower-level offences, possession and sale, as the higher-level offences of trafficking and wholesale. The largest disparity in mean sentence length by offence category was violence, where sentences were 35 per cent longer, and for drug trafficking with 17 per cent. This study contributes to the existing research with a detailed exposition of differences across different drug offences and by including the in-out decision and sanction severity.
This paper explores the complexities of involving partner organisations in co-generative learning processes within Action Research (AR) initiatives. Despite formal agreements, action researchers often face challenges in collaboratively addressing specific organisational issues through AR cycles. When action researchers adopt the “friendly outsider’ role, their initial task is to secure commitment to an AR initiative from senior leaders as sponsors. However, the existing literature lacks comprehensive guidance on facilitating this commitment. Therefore, drawing from both literature and empirical cases, this paper examines the pivotal role of the AR sponsor in securing funding and political backing, offering constructive critique, and facilitating learning. It provides insights into how action researchers can facilitate sponsors to enact these roles effectively so as to ensure the success and sustainability of organisational changes resulting from AR initiatives.
Family members of a loved-one with an alcohol use disorder (AUD) experience much stress and other adverse impacts, especially those that are frontline caregivers and therefore most proximal to AUD. Previous research has shown such family members experience altered functioning of the prefrontal cortex in response to images of their loved-one, and these responses have similarities to brain responses to alcohol cues for a person with AUD. The current study aimed to expand this research by examining whole-brain functional activation of family members’ brains. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure activation responses of 10 family members with a loved-one with diagnosed AUD, as well as that of 10 control group participants, during an event-related research paradigm. Results from Generalized Linear Modeling (GLM) indicated significant activation in the left hippocampus and left amygdala for family members of an AUD loved-one, and this activation was significantly greater than that of a control group. These two subcortical regions play a role in the reward network and their activation found in this study may be associated with a reward-based “approach” response – drawing further parallels between the functioning of the impacted family member’s brain and that of the brain of someone with AUD. This understanding influences how clinicians might provide services to family members of those with AUD.
Extant literature guiding therapists’ work with female torture survivors is scant. The study presented here engaged nine providers who specialize in this work in a qualitative inquiry regarding clinical presentations unique to this clientele, including the impact(s) that torture has on their a priori and future relationships with intimate partners, family members, and others in their immediate community(ies). The manners in which survivors’ experiences with torture influences therapy processes (e.g., transference, attention to culture, pairings with extra-therapeutic factors), therapists’ attendance to self-of-the-therapist and supervision foci, and specific suggestions and advice for novice therapists preparing to engage in this type of work were also explored. Clinical- and research- implications of study findings are put forth in conclusion.
We explore digital transformation and socio-technical systems through the perspectives of collaboration, co-generation, and domestication. Building on Morten Levin’s influential work, we discuss how digital technologies are integrated into work environments, emphasising the necessity for democratic, participatory approaches. We discuss how his ideas of collaborative, democratic practice originating in the 1990s hold up to today’s organisational challenges like digital and sustainability transitions. Are the ideas and practices still valid, or do we need to update them? We identify the grand challenges that must be met: Ensuring sustainable digital transitions and developing educated, skilled workers in digitally transformed organisations.
People’s subjective wellbeing is influenced by the built environment, including housing and neighbourhood characteristics. Consistent with prior literature, we find that wellbeing is associated with the condition of a resident’s house (particularly dampness and cold) and with the resident’s perception of their neighbourhood (especially relating to social capital and safety). We show also that the form of tenure (public rental, private rental, owner-occupier) has a material impact on subjective wellbeing. Identical people in identical settings may have different wellbeing outcomes depending on their security of housing tenure. Our findings utilise a survey administered to residents in public rental housing, private rentals and owner-occupiers in New Zealand, focusing on the capital city, Wellington. Despite selection effects, which are likely to bias findings against higher wellbeing for public housing tenants, we find that public tenants have higher subjective wellbeing (WHO-5 and life satisfaction) than do private tenants, and similar wellbeing to owner-occupiers. Length of tenure helps to explain wellbeing differences between public and private tenants, likely reflecting New Zealand law under which private renters have insecure tenure.
PurposeThis cross-sectional study aims to understand the relationship between responses on the Anxiety/Depression (A/D) dimension of the EQ-5D-5L and symptoms of anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 instruments. In doing so, we investigate the comparative performance of the dimension between diagnostic groups (i.e. anxiety (GAD-7); depression (PHQ-9); anxiety & depression versus none). We additionally investigate the discriminatory performance between sub-populations based on gender, age, education and self-reported chronic conditions.Methods19,902 general population participants completed a health survey in May/June 2020, from five European countries and the United States. Performance of A/D was calculated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), and was compared to having anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 8), depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) and both versus none for the total population and sub-populations. Several additional sensitivity analyses were conducted, including calculations of the optimal A/D cut-off.ResultsThe performance in the total sample was good (AUROC > 0.8) and did not differ significantly between diagnostic groups. The performance differed significantly between the age groups, with worse performance in the younger groups, and differed between those with a singular chronic condition, with worse performance in those indicating having an anxiety or depression disorder. The performance did not differ significantly by gender, education, nor total chronic conditions.ConclusionThe A/D dimension captures symptoms of anxiety, depression or both equally well. Performance is worse in the younger population. Interpretation in those with a self-reported anxiety or depression disorder should be further investigated. This is the first-of-its-kind large population sample performance analysis, where we present evidence that the performance of the A/D dimension differs between ages, and thus intra-age comparative results may be flawed.
This study investigates the relation between exposure to neighborhood violence and student performance, focusing on the spatial effects of crime. Using São Paulo city (Brazil) as case study, we applied multilevel and simultaneous equations models combined with a spatial approach. If the effects of crime can be felt across the city, reducing this type of violence should concern public policies in all districts. Application of the combined methods considered 5th and 9th graders from the public school network. Violence was negatively related to student proficiency. Overall, the spatial behavior of crime should be considered when analyzing the relation between violence and education. Crime prevention should be considered in designing education policies since it can benefit both students in violent areas and those in their surroundings.
Democratic stability hinges on voters’ commitment to democratic norms, yet there are many examples of voters’ willingness to tolerate politicians who violate such principles. This article examines whether critical responses by other politicians can effectively counter the appeal of political candidates who have engaged in authoritarian behavior. We argue that costly action by fellow partisan politicians can reduce the electoral popularity of authoritarian politicians. We test this in a preregistered conjoint experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey in the United Kingdom. The results show that voters are less likely to choose politicians displaying authoritarian behavior, when they are criticized by other legislators, and that such counteractions are particularly effective when they are costly. These findings have important implications, as they show that politicians, especially co-partisans, can play an important role in reducing the appeal of authoritarian politicians.
Sociological theory and empirical research have found that parents’ socioeconomic status and related resources affect their children’s educational outcomes. Findings from behavior genetics reveal genetic underpinnings of the intergenerational transmission of education, thus altering previous conclusions about purely environmental transmission mechanisms. In recent years, studies in molecular genetics have led to new insights. Genomic data, polygenic scores, and other facets of sociogenomics are increasingly used to advance research in social stratification. Notably, the 2018 discovery of “genetic nurture” suggested that parents’ genes influence children above and beyond the genes they directly transmitted to their children. Such indirect genetic effects can be interpreted as consequences of parental behavior, which is itself influenced by the parents’ genetics and is essential for their children’s environment. Indirect genetic effects fit hand in glove with the sociological literature because they represent environmental transmission mechanisms. For instance, parenting behaviors, which are partly influenced by parents’ genes, shape children’s home environments and possibly their later educational outcomes. However, current findings based on more sophisticated research designs demonstrate that “genetic nurture” effects are actually much smaller than initially assumed and hence call for a reevaluation of common narratives found in the social stratification literature. In this paper, we review recent developments and ongoing research integrating molecular genetics to study educational outcomes, and we discuss their implications for sociological stratification research.
Brexit is typically seen as a canonical example of right-wing populism, yet a third of those who voted for left-of-centre parties at the 2015 UK General Election also supported Brexit one year later. This bloc of 5 million people was around four times the size of the Leave campaign’s margin of victory. This article constructs the first discursive analysis of leftist Brexit support. Drawing on qualitative interviews with twenty-three left-identifying residents of the ‘Red Wall’ region of England, I examine continuities between leftist identities and pro-Brexit discourse. Participants consistently constructed their political identities from ideas that broadly corresponded to Fraser’s folk paradigms of social justice ‘redistribution’ and ‘recognition’. Relations between the paradigms were more complex—and more antagonistic—in participant accounts than Fraser’s ‘distinct but equivalent’ ideal. Three discursive logics promoted leftist Brexit support by (i) counterposing redistribution of wealth against the ‘neoliberal’ European Union, while associating Brexit itself with notions of (ii) ‘underdog spirit’ and (iii) ‘unity’. Each logic shared affinities with the redistribution paradigm, and were often expressed alongside antagonism toward recognition. I conclude that Brexit split the left by exploiting pre-existing tensions between the left’s constituent parts. Leftist Brexit support was thus a partial epiphenomenon of the contemporary left’s dual form. A shift away from Fraser’s ‘perspectival dualism’ may constrain further Brexit-style splits.
Ensuring a stable employment situation is crucial for asylum seekers, as it not only provides them with economic resources but also facilitates their active integration into the life of the host country and adaptation to a new environment. However, the course and (in)stability of employment trajectories of asylum seekers and refugees remain little explored in Belgium. We aim to describe how those trajectories are shaped for a cohort of asylum-seeking migrants who arrived in Belgium between 2004 and 2007. The concept of (in)stability is further examined by looking at whether individuals stay for long in specific activity sectors. Using data from administrative sources, we rely on sequence analysis to describe employment trajectories. Then, we use logistic regressions to explore the determinants of employment stability. Results suggest that employment careers among asylum migrants are unstable, with short and fragmented periods of employment. The sectors ‘Hotel, Catering and Trade’, ‘Building and Industry’, and ‘Health and Social’ present career paths that show a certain continuity, by remaining in a single activity sector over the observed period after arrival. Our study also indicates the existence of an ethnic stratification across these activity sectors which group people with the same origins. We argue that this is in favour of the stabilisation of employment situations. Finally, this research suggests that economic integration policies for asylum migrants should not only address entry into employment but also long-term career stability. They should leverage benefits of the social networks while promoting access to diverse sectors to avoid marginalisation.
PurposeTo investigate the contribution of demographic trends in countries’ age and gender composition to value set validity and obsolescence.MethodsTime-trade off (TTO) valuation data from 3 EQ-5D-3L value sets of 20 years or older from the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States were re-analyzed using Bayesian heteroskedastic Tobit models with sex and age group-specific scale parameters. Original value sets were obtained by weighting the original preference structures with the countries’ original demographic composition at the time of the data collection. Updated value sets were created using the original preference structure weighted using the countries’ most recent demographic composition. The differences between the original and updated value sets were monitored and compared based on 95% credible intervals.ResultsThe gender and age composition of the investigated countries changed in all 3 countries over time. The modelled health state preferences also depended on the respondents’ gender and age. However, the overall impact of this demographic change on the investigated value sets was negligeable in all 3 countries and this finding was robust to accounting for the impact of ethnicity trends in the United States.ConclusionValue sets may become redundant and obsolete for various reasons, but demographic change was not identified as a contributing factor.
PurposeBoth metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cognitive dysfunction impair health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study aims to determine whether individuals experiencing both MetS and cognitive dysfunction have lower HRQOL.MethodsThis cross-sectional study enrolled 567 participants who attended outpatient clinics at a medical center in northern Taiwan. MetS was diagnosed according to the modified criteria for the Asian population. Cognitive function was categorized as normal, mild cognitive dysfunction, and advanced cognitive dysfunction according to the score of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Taiwanese version. HRQOL was assessed using the SF-36v2® Health Survey (SF-36v2). The associations of the comorbidity status of MetS and cognitive dysfunction with HRQOL were analyzed using linear regression models, adjusting for age, sex, marital status, education level, income groups, and activities of daily living.ResultsOut of 567 participants, 33 (5.8%) had MetS with mild cognitive dysfunction, and 34 (6.0%) had MetS with advanced cognitive dysfunction. Participants with both MetS and advanced cognitive dysfunction exhibited the lowest scores in the physical component summary and almost all scales of HRQOL. MetS exacerbated the inverse association between mild cognitive dysfunction and the mental component summary. For those with MetS, the scores on scales of role physical, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning worsened as cognitive function deteriorated (allPtrend<0.05).ConclusionAs the severity of comorbidity between MetS and cognitive dysfunction varies, patients exhibited poorer performance in different aspects of HRQOL. Future research is needed to find solutions to improve HRQOL for patients with both MetS and cognitive dysfunction.
ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to provide Chinese utility weights for the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Utility Measure-Core 10 Dimensions (EORTC QLU-C10D) which is a preference-based cancer-specific utility instrument derived from the EORTC QLQ-C30.MethodsWe conducted an online survey of the general population in China, with quota sampling for age and gender. Each respondent was asked to complete a discrete choice experimental survey consisting of 16 randomly selected choice sets. The conditional logit model and mixed logit model were used to analyze respondents’ preferences, and the goodness of fit of the model was tested.ResultsA total of 2003 respondents were included in the analysis. Utility decrements within dimensions were typically monotonic. Monotonic inconsistency issues in the Fatigue, Sleep, and Nausea dimensions were normalized by monotonicity correction. Physical functioning, Pain, and Role functioning were associated with the greatest utility weights, with the smallest decrements being in Bowel problems and Emotional functioning. The utility value for the worst health state was 0.083, i.e. slightly higher than being dead.ConclusionsThis study provides the first China-specific set of value for the QLU-C10D based on societal preferences of the Chinese adult general population. The value set can be used as a cancer-specific scoring system for economic evaluations of new oncology therapies and technologies in China.
Nearly 60 million children (81.2% of all children) in the U.S. live in diverse urban areas. As children grow and develop their identities in these diverse cities, the people they meet, the way their lives are organized, the way their families live and survive, and virtually all aspects of their lives will be shaped by the city. Children’s books that represent city life should be a good vehicle for children to both understand and explore their own and others’ lives in the city. This study examines how children’s literature represents city life, through an iterative content analysis of the 70 children’s books recommended by Cooperative Children’s Book Center on the topic of city life. The study is framed by theories of the city that focus on difference and community. Five themes were found in the content analysis: (a) City life is diverse; (b) City life centers on encounters with others; (c) City life supports community; (d) City life contains patterns and rhythms that create constancy; and (e) City life has challenges but few inequalities. A critical discussion is included, addressing the idealized vision of a middle class life presented in the books, as well as missing voices. The books also confirm the significance of community cultural wealth, in which children and their families develop a supportive system with their community.
This quantitative study empirically examines the mediating factors between Christian religiosity, political trust, and populist attitudes. As a novel approach, we ask whether religious coping with contingency reduces anxiety among religious citizens. Given that anxiety can reduce institutional trust and increase the appeal of populism, religiously reduced anxiety could support democratic attitudes. In addition, generalized social trust and acceptance of immigration are tested as further mediators between Christian religiosity and its political outcomes. Based on a recent representative sample of the German population (6th Membership Survey of the Protestant and Roman Catholic Churches in Germany), regression analyses find limited evidence for the coping thesis. Overall, religious coping, generalized social trust, and acceptance of immigration together explain to a large extent the higher prevalence of political trust and the lower prevalence of populist attitudes among liberal Christians in Germany.
Work-family balance (WFB) is attained if parents combine work and family roles aligned with their values. For an egalitarian parent aiming to implement a 50/50-split-model, this means sharing paid work, childcare, and housework equally with their partner (involvement balance), performing well in all roles (effective balance), while having positive emotions (emotional balance). This is difficult since work and family are competing for time and attention. Therefore, this article presents resources which can help parents attain WFB within a 50/50-split-model. Quantitative data ofn= 1036 couples participating in the Dresden Study on Parenting, Work, and Mental Health (DREAM) were used to calculate the implementation rate of the 50/50-split-model at 14 months postpartum. Quantitative DREAM data were screened to purposively selectn= 25 participants implementing a 50/50-split-model for the qualitative study DREAMTALK. Problem-centered interviews were conducted and analyzed via qualitative content analysis. Quantitative results showed a 50/50-split-model implementation rate of 3.8–17.5% among German parents. Qualitative results revealed 14 individual- and eight macro-level resources to facilitate WFB within a 50/50-split-model. Individual-level examples are acknowledging benefits of childcare assistance, segmentation from paid work and controversially, in other situations, integration of paid work and family. Macro-level examples are availability of childcare assistance, of solo paternal leave, paid work < 39 h/week, employee flexibility options, and family-friendly workplace cultures. To conclude, the full potential of individual-level resources applied by parents is attained when supported by macro-level resources provided by politics and employers. Parents, politics, and employers can facilitate WFB within the 50/50-split-model to foster gender equality.
Regardless of intentions to stop or space childbearing, women in many countries experience unintended fertility (having more children than desired or having children when they do not want to do so). In Pakistan, around one-fifth of all pregnancies are unintended, which can reflect limited reproductive autonomy. Using the Pakistan Demographic Health Surveys of 1990–1991 and 2017–2018, we examine whether perceived spousal concordance on desired family size and women’s education influence how women characterize the intendedness of second and higher-order births. Compared to women with perceived concordance, women who perceive their husbands have a higher desired family size are less likely to characterize a recent birth as unwanted than intended, and women who are unaware of their husbands’ desired family size are also less likely to characterize births as mistimed or unwanted. The relative risk of reporting an unwanted birth decreased across all categories of perceived spousal concordance between 1990–1991 and 2017–2018 except for women who reported that their husbands want fewer children than them. Compared to women with no formal education, women with a primary or secondary education are more likely to have mistimed than intended or unwanted fertility, and this link has not changed significantly over time. The results suggest all women continue to face challenges in implementing preferences about birth timing and spacing for second and higher-order births. Although better-educated women do not appear to face issues in exerting stopping preferences, they appear to have greater difficulty exerting timing preferences. This paper extends research on the fertility transition in Pakistan, and continued work is needed to understand why rising levels of education among women are not translating into fewer mistimed births.
Racism and microaggressions remain a formidable challenge for racialized students within the Canadian educational system, significantly hindering their educational attainment. This paper presents an overview of the findings stemming from a qualitative study that delved into the repercussions of microaggressions within the classroom on racialized students in a Canadian university. The study employed a semi-structured interview guide for data collection, with the goal of shedding light on the experiences and effects of racism within the classroom. The study's results underscore the profound impact of microaggressions on racialized students, revealing a cascade of mental and emotional challenges triggered by these experiences. Furthermore, the research exposes how microaggressions can profoundly disrupt students' sense of belonging and dampen their level of engagement and participation in class activities. By contributing to the existing body of literature on racism in university settings, this study provokes important questions about the tangible manifestation of inclusivity and diversity values in the everyday dynamics of the classroom. It highlights a critical need for academic institutions to go beyond rhetoric and implement tangible measures that foster a truly inclusive and equitable educational environment. This study's implications extend to the domain of learning for racialized students, emphasizing the need to address microaggressions and racism within the classroom to ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to thrive within the academic sphere. The study encourages further exploration of these issues and calls for proactive steps to create an educational landscape where diversity is celebrated and microaggressions find no place.
Organizations have started more progressively using and offering family benefits including parental leaves to address the issues of balancing work and family life. Although such leaves are fundamental for supporting, attracting, and retaining women, we examine whether such leaves may also inadvertently affect women’s careers in occupations that overly value masculine traits, unless managed carefully. Drawing on the literature on gender stereotypes (micro factors) and occupation gender type (macro factors), we argue that longer (vs. shorter) parental leaves negatively affect women’s work outcomes (i.e., annual income, salary recommendation, hireability, and leadership effectiveness) in men-dominated but not in women-dominated occupations because it lowers perceptions of women’s agency. We find support for our hypotheses across three studies in the Australian context with an archival data set and two experiments. Our work shows that men-dominated organizational structures reinforce traditional gender stereotypes, whereas such reinforcement does not happen in women-dominated organizational structures. Our research equips leaders and organizations with insights into the unintended negative consequences of parental leave for women. This understanding serves as a crucial first step in developing strategies and programs to mitigate these effects, thereby supporting women in men-dominated occupations and fostering more inclusive and healthy workplaces.
Belief-bias occurs when individuals’ prior beliefs impact their ability to judge the validity (i.e., structure) of an argument such that they are predisposed to accept conclusions consistent with their prior beliefs regardless of the argument’s validity. The present study uses a minimal explanation paradigm to evaluate how United States Military Academy cadets assess the validity of arguments surrounding the pull-out from Afghanistan presented by different sources of authority. Participants exhibited a significantly greater likelihood of rejecting an invalid argument with true facts compared to accepting a valid argument with false facts, with overconfidence scores implying they were unaware of this difficulty in reasoning. We also found that participants were were more critical of arguments about US capabilities coming from civilian sources. Results from the HEXACO personality assessment showed that task performance was positively correlated with perfectionism and inquisitiveness sub-scales, implying that those high in those measures were less likely to exhibit belief-bias. Even when factoring-in these traits, results revealed a small yet significant trend for participants to reject valid arguments from their peers compared with senior military and civilian counterparts. Overall, the present study shows a differential impact of belief-bias on true vs false facts, that this is influenced by the underlying source of the argument, and that personality traits mediate these effects.
Explaining what leads to higher or lower levels of subjective well-being (SWB) in childhood and adolescence is one of the cornerstones within this field of studies, since it can lead to the development of more focused preventive and promotion actions. Although many indicators of SWB have been identified, selecting one over the other to obtain a reasonably short list poses a challenge, given that models are particularly sensitive to the indicators considered.Two Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, one based on Extreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forest and the other on Lineal Regression, were applied to 77 indicators included in the 3rd wave of the Children’s Worlds project and then compared. ExtremeGradient Boosting outperforms the other two, while Lineal Regression outperforms Random Forest. Moreover, the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm was used to compare models for each of the 35 participating countries with that of the pooled sample on the basis of responses from 93,349 children and adolescents collected through a representative sampling and belonging to the 10 and 12-year-olds age groups. Large differences were detected by country with regard to the importance of these 77 indicators in explaining the scores for the five-item-version of the CWSWBS5 (Children’s Worlds Subjective Well-Being Scale). The process followed highlights the greater capacity of some ML techniques in providing models with higher explanatory power and less error, and in more clearly differentiating between the contributions of the different indicators to explain children’s and adolescents’ SWB. This finding is useful when it comes to designing shorter but more reliable questionnaires (a selection of 29 indicators were used in this case).
This paper provides an in-depth analysis of Lebanon’s severe economic crisis, a situation aggravated by the collapse of Banque du Liban’s financial strategies, delayed reforms by the government, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the devastating Beirut Port explosion. These events have precipitated a sharp decline in disposable income, soaring inflation rates, and an alarming increase in unemployment and multidimensional poverty. Central to this study is a comprehensive field survey that examines eighteen coping mechanisms adopted by workers in various economic sectors of Lebanon. From this survey, we introduce a new index designed to systematically categorize and evaluate these coping strategies across four critical dimensions of well-being: nutrition, healthcare, education, and financial issues. We use this index to quantify and understand the extent to which workers have relied on these coping mechanisms, offering novel insights into the socio-economic repercussions of the crisis.
Institutions of higher education (IHEs) often disseminate risk reduction strategies intended to reduce sexual assault victimization and/or perpetration. This research examined the content and context of publicly available risk reduction strategies offered by a nationally representative sample of 4-year IHEs in the United States (N= 242; public and private not-for-profit institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Tribal institutions). We identified strategies for 102 (42%) IHEs. Using a sociocognitive approach to critical discourse analysis, we examined the specific messages conveyed via IHE risk reduction strategies, how larger sociocultural discourses and power structures were reproduced or reinforced, and the potential implications for readers (i.e., university students). Nearly all IHEs directed their strategies toward potential victims. These strategies were broad in scope, imploring behavioral modification and restriction (e.g., never be alone), and requiring specific responses to sexual assault (e.g., physical resistance). Fewer IHEs directed their strategies toward potential perpetrators; these strategies were narrower in scope, focusing on sexual consent. Overall, strategies reproduced rape myths (e.g., stranger-perpetrated assault is common) and positioned potential victims as uniquely responsible for preventing sexual assault—messaging that may be particularly harmful when disseminated by powerful institutions responsible for sexual assault prevention and response. IHEs should assess the utility of risk reduction strategies and, if retained, revise their strategies to counter harmful sexual assault messaging.
IntroductionLack of knowledge of Early Intervention (EI) is a barrier to developmental delay (DD) management. We aimed to examine the feasibility of measuring pediatricians’ knowledge of EI, determine the distribution of EI knowledge, and determine factors associated with increased EI knowledge.MethodsWe conducted an exploratory cross-sectional study with a convenience sample from a local American Academy of Pediatrics chapter to administer a survey with 10 multiple-choice questions regarding the EI referral process, evaluation process, eligibility criteria and fee structure. Our outcome variable was a composite score of these 10 multiple-choice questions, Total Knowledge Score (TKS). Our predictor variables included physician characteristics (i.e., years of experience, percentage of patients seen with private insurance, receipt of EI training in the last 5 years) and practice characteristics (i.e., medical home status).ResultsOur sample consisted of a total of 194 pediatric residents/attendings. Multivariable regression demonstrated seeing ≥ 50% patients who were privately insured, increased experience, and receiving training in the last 5 years were associated with higher TKS.DiscussionWe were able to quantitatively evaluate physician’s knowledge of EI and demonstrated that seeing a majority of privately insured patients, having more experience, and having received formal EI training in the last 5 years were associated with higher EI knowledge. This disproportionate distribution of EI knowledge has the potential to contribute to disparities in the management of DD. This may indicate that medical institutions, where physicians see a small percent of privately insured patients, need to hire more experienced physicians, and provide routine EI training.
Gender-based technology-facilitated violence and abuse (GBTFVA) is a common experience for those engaging with digital technologies in their everyday lives. To better understand why GBTFVA persists, it is necessary to understand the false beliefs and cultural narratives that enable and sustain them. Drawing on the literature on rape myths, this paper explores the prevalence of seven gender-based online violence myths among Canadian men. To achieve this, we adapted the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance (IRMA) (Payne et al., in J Research in Personality 33:27–68, 1999) to assess GBTFVA, and surveyed 1,297 Canadian men between 18 and 30 years old on their GBTFVA beliefs. Our results show that GBTFVA myths and cultural narratives are prevalent across participants, though endorsement levels vary. Four myths were more strongly endorsed:It Wasn’t Really Gender-Based Online Abuse,He Didn’t Mean To,Gender-Based Online Abuse Is a Deviant Event,and She Lied.Overall, these findings help to name and thus begin to address the narratives that sustain and perpetuate gender-based online violence.
Media representations of sexuality can play a relevant role in the development of gender stereotypes and sexual learning processes. In the current pre-registered study, we examined the representation of sexuality in content on Netflix, a dominant force in global mass media consumption. We coded 271 mixed-gender sexual scenes across seven highly popular Netflix series for orgasm portrayal, depiction of sexual behaviors, including clitoral stimulation, and gendered sexual scripts (i.e., initiation, control, and expression of desires). Our results revealed a nuanced picture of women’s sexual pleasure representation. Women’s orgasms were depicted less frequently than men’s, although orgasm portrayal was generally rare. Sexual behaviors were mostly limited to penile-vaginal intercourse, though cunnilingus was depicted more frequently than fellatio. Regarding gendered sexual scripts, women were portrayed as equally sexually agentic as men, initiating sexual encounters, taking control, and expressing their needs and desires. Our findings indicate that this content simultaneously reinforces and challenges gender stereotypes related to sexual experiences, highlighting the need for sexual educators to critically address the realism of mainstream media portrayals to foster a nuanced understanding of sexuality and pleasure.
Corporate power has an intimidating impact on the environment. It causes environmental degradation and threatens the ecological balance and sustainability of the planet. This article analyses the representation of corporate power and its effects on the environment in two classic children’s books: Dr. Seuss’s (The Lorax, Random House Books for Young Readers, 1971) and Bill Peet’s (The Wump World, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1970). It examines how these two classic children’s books depict the environmental damage caused by corporate power in the 21st century and how they can educate and motivate young readers to care about environmental issues and their root causes. Using a critical discourse analysis approach based on Fairclough’s model, the article studies how language is used in both texts to construct and maintain dominant ideologies, manipulate and marginalize alternative voices and exploit natural resources and vulnerable communities. The findings reveal that the discourse of Once-ler and Pollutians reflects a capitalist and consumerist ideology that legitimizes their environmental destruction and silences environmental concerns. However, language can also be a tool of resistance and change that can challenge and expose the dominant ideology, as shown by the voices of the Lorax and the Wumps in the same texts. The article suggests that by reading and analyzing these two classic children’s books, young readers can learn to critically examine the language used by different actors and to use the language themselves to create a more just and sustainable society.
This study investigated the effects of three types of bullying victimization (relational, verbal, and physical) on attitudes toward anti-bullying, moderated by the role of parental support. The data used in this study were obtained from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018, a survey conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that included responses from 11,990 Chinese adolescents aged 15 years. Multivariate regression modeling and the Johnson–Neyman technique were used to examine the moderating effect of parental support on the relationship between the three types of bullying victimization and attitudes toward bullying. The results indicated that the three types of bullying victimization were significantly and positively correlated with students’ anti-bullying attitudes. Furthermore, parental support moderated the relationship between the three types of bullying victimization and anti-bullying attitudes. Specifically, when the value of parental support was less than 84.215, 81.728, and 69.878, relational, verbal, and physical bullying victimization, respectively, had a significant positive effect on adolescents’ anti-bullying attitudes through the moderating effect of parental support. These findings suggest that parents should provide care and support to children who are victims of bullying.
A personal brand is represented as promoting skills, experience, and career goals to other professionals. The business process of the internet as the media for information and communication technology is known as e-trade which encourages the display of creation on e-trade sites or digital markets as cost-efficient. It makes brands hard to follow the suggestions due to their vagueness and is an obstacle to estimating efficiency. Thus, this study stripped the personal brand down as well as integrated social transparency theory to develop a unique framework evaluating how social transparency factors affect the personal brand which is highlighted to audiences. A survey was performed based on audiences’ responses to posts and active audiences from Facebook and Instagram, and applied SEM to build the proposed model. The empirical results showed content and interaction transparency were significantly related to competency, standards, and relationship commitment. Identity transparency was found to have a negligible relationship with competency, standards, and relationship commitment. This study also researches brand ethics and brand research methods from the ethical perspective. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, the proposed framework provides a new view of evaluating personal brands in social networks in depth, which encourages more theory development in this area. Second, the empirical results clarified the association between the factors of social transparency and personal brand. The effective methods of improving personal brands were discussed for practitioners.
This article presents the preliminary results of a qualitative exploratory study conducted between 2021 and 2023. This study was based on in-depth interviews with law enforcement agents and experts in gender and security, and document analysis. Using examples from Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, we aimed to analyze how stereotypes can shape gender bias, particularly regarding how women in middle and high-ranking positions in organized crime in the Americas outmaneuver law enforcement. We argue that women stereotypes, and gender bias may influence the capability of law enforcement agencies to prosecute and condemn Latin American women in middle and high-ranking positions in criminal organizations. Gender bias favors women, particularly in their perpetrators’ role, and has become a source of power, showing that Latin American women have agency, and act strategically within criminal organizations, since they are potentially less suspicious in the eyes of law enforcement agencies. This research contributes to shedding light on the currently existing blind spot on the role of Latin American women in organized crime in the Americas, and has policy implications. It is useful in fostering the implementation of state policies capable of including non-stereotypical women's role in organized crime.
We investigate the forecasting accuracy of several simple methods for predicting mortality in small regional areas in Poland. We focus on methods that scale country-level forecasts appropriately and, therefore, can be used by official statistical agencies to improve population projections. We examine data from 379 sub-NUTS-3 districts in Poland for the period 2006–2019, divided into three subperiods. The first period is treated as the training sample and the latter two the testing subperiods. The mortality surface method delivers the most accurate forecasts of the mortality profiles whereas using the district-level standardized mortality rates (SMR) calculated for several broad age groups to scale the country-level mortality forecasts gives the best life expectancy at birth predictions. The latter approach is far better than using the NUTS-2-based standardized mortality rate (SMR), as practiced by the Polish statistical agency. For single age-groups predictions, the SMR-based methods deliver relatively accurate forecasts for young cohorts, but their forecasting accuracy deteriorates significantly with age.
The water station in The Pond Room had always been a popular option especially since in this region the summer heat is extremely intense. The Master Teacher noticed that Zach, a 3-year-old with special needs and an IEP from the local school district, returned to the water station over and over again and was very focused on his activities. His obsession with water also drew other children in the play. After observing the children play freely with water for two weeks, the teacher decided to expand this water play into a series of developmentally appropriate, meaningful investigations about water. She felt that this water project was a great opportunity for preschoolers with and without disabilities to construct STEAM concepts and skills which will prepare them for more complex and abstract STEAM concepts in later schooling. With the goals of developing students’ knowledge and positive attitudes toward STEAM and promoting their STEAM-related questioning and problem-solving skills, the master teacher began the inquiry and embarked on a water project in her classroom.
Social inclusion indicators inform policy advocacy and intervention. However, a critical piece of information is often missing: public opinion. Efforts to enhance social inclusion could backfire if they provoke opinion backlash or intergroup hostilities. In this paper, we explain the importance and nuances of inclusive attitudes and develop an easy-to-use survey instrument that tracks public opinion regarding different marginalized groups and support measures systematically. Using evidence from a representative telephone survey in Hong Kong (N = 1010), as well as a parallel online survey (N = 1000), we demonstrate the multidimensional nature of public attitudes toward social inclusion and our instrument’s excellent psychometric properties and potential for use in various research settings. Although developed in the context of Hong Kong, the survey items can be decomposed and adapted to suit diverse urban societies. By highlighting the importance and complexity of public opinion, we hope to foster a more participatory approach to promoting social inclusion.
Gambian’s migration towards Europe, mainly constituted by young men, substantially increased since 2010. Arriving mainly through the Central Mediterranean Route because of the extremely scarce possibility to obtain a visa, most Gambians applied for asylum in Italy, the first arrival country according to the Dublin regulation. The administrative and juridical system largely rejected their asylum requests, leaving most undocumented, in legal limbo, and deportable. The paper focuses on the different trajectories of Gambians in Italy in their post-asylum phase, discussing how existential precariousness heavily shapes their lives and how this condition compromises future building along different but entangled temporalities. In particular, the contribution wants to reflect on the various intertwined timelines that people on the move forge and inhabit, showing how they are always multiple and articulated through spatial, social, cultural, economic, and personal dimensions. In so doing, I analyze temporal dispossession as a continuous process that Gambians on the move experience prior to, during, and after their trip to Europe and which they actively struggle to overcome.
We assess how immigrant parent legal status shapes children’s physical and mental health. Using the Hispanic Community Health Study of Latino Youth—a multi-site dataset—we evaluated mean differences in multiple physical and mental health indicators and parents’ and children’s stress and resilience by parents’ (primarily mothers’) legal status (N = 1177). We estimated regression models of two overall child health outcomes—allostatic load and any internalized disorder. Average allostatic load was 28% higher (0.36 standard deviations) and average prevalence of any internalizing disorder was 16% points greater for children of foreign-born unauthorized versus US-born parents. Higher levels of socioeconomic and acculturative stress contributed to children of foreign-born unauthorized parents’ heightened health risk, while resilience factors—parental health and familial support—protected their health. Children with unauthorized immigrant parents experience both negative physical and mental health outcomes that can have potential long-term costs.
