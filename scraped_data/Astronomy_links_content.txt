The first James Webb Space Telescope/MIRI photometric observations of TRAPPIST-1 b allowed for the detection of the thermal emission of the planet at 15 μm, suggesting that the planet could be a bare rock with a zero albedo and no redistribution of heat. These observations at 15 μm were acquired as part of Guaranteed Time Observer time that included a twin programme at 12.8 μm to obtain measurements inside and outside the CO2absorption band. Here we present five new occultations of TRAPPIST-1 b observed with MIRI in an additional photometric band at 12.8 μm. We perform a global fit of the ten eclipses and derive a planet-to-star flux ratio and 1σerror of 452 ± 86 ppm and 775 ± 90 ppm at 12.8 μm and 15 μm, respectively. We find that two main scenarios emerge. An airless planet model with an unweathered (fresh) ultramafic surface, that could be indicative of relatively recent geological processes, fits the data well. Alternatively, a thick, pure-CO2atmosphere with photochemical hazes that create a temperature inversion and result in the CO2feature being seen in emission also works, although with some caveats. Our results highlight the challenges in accurately determining a planet’s atmospheric or surface nature solely from broadband filter measurements of its emission, but also point towards two very interesting scenarios that will be further investigated with the forthcoming phase curve of TRAPPIST-1 b.The total charm-quark production cross section per unit of rapidity\(\textrm{d}\sigma ({{\textrm{c}}\overline{\textrm{c}}})/\textrm{d}y\), and the fragmentation fractions of charm quarks to different charm-hadron species\(f(\textrm{c}\rightarrow {\textrm{h}}_{\textrm{c}})\), are measured for the first time in p–Pb collisions at\(\sqrt{s_\textrm{NN}} = 5.02~\text {Te}\hspace{-1.00006pt}\textrm{V} \)at midrapidity (\(-0.96<y<0.04\)in the centre-of-mass frame) using data collected by ALICE at the CERN LHC. The results are obtained based on all the available measurements of prompt production of ground-state charm-hadron species:\(\textrm{D}^{0}\),\(\textrm{D}^{+}\),\(\textrm{D}_\textrm{s}^{+}\), and\(\mathrm {J/\psi }\)mesons, and\(\Lambda _\textrm{c}^{+}\)and\(\Xi _\textrm{c}^{0}\)baryons. The resulting cross section is\( \textrm{d}\sigma ({{\textrm{c}}\overline{\textrm{c}}})/\textrm{d}y =219.6 \pm 6.3\;(\mathrm {stat.}) {\;}_{-11.8}^{+10.5}\;(\mathrm {syst.}) {\;}_{-2.9}^{+8.3}\;(\mathrm {extr.})\pm 5.4\;(\textrm{BR})\pm 4.6\;(\mathrm {lumi.}) \pm 19.5\;(\text {rapidity shape})+15.0\;(\Omega _\textrm{c}^{0})\;\textrm{mb} \), which is consistent with a binary scaling of pQCD calculations from pp collisions. The measured fragmentation fractions are compatible with those measured in pp collisions at\(\sqrt{s} = 5.02\)and 13 TeV, showing an increase in the relative production rates of charm baryons with respect to charm mesons in pp and p–Pb collisions compared with\(\mathrm {e^{+}e^{-}}\)and\(\mathrm {e^{-}p}\)collisions. The\(p_\textrm{T}\)-integrated nuclear modification factor of charm quarks,\(R_\textrm{pPb}({\textrm{c}}\overline{\textrm{c}})= 0.91 \pm 0.04\;\mathrm{(stat.)} ^{+0.08}_{-0.09}\;\mathrm{(syst.)} ^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\;\mathrm{(extr.)} \pm 0.03\;\mathrm{(lumi.)}\), is found to be consistent with unity and with theoretical predictions including nuclear modifications of the parton distribution functions.We study the propagation of massless fermionic fields, implementing a family of special functions: Heun functions, in solving the wave equation in three three-dimensional backgrounds, including the BTZ black hole in string theory and Lifshitz black hole solutions in conformal gravity and Hu–SawickiF(R) theory. The main properties of the selected black hole solutions is that their line elements are Weyl related to that of a homogeneous spacetime, whose spatial part possesses Lie symmetry, described by Lobachevsky-type geometry with arbitrary negative Gaussian curvature. Using the Weyl symmetry of massless Dirac action, we consider the perturbation equations of fermionic fields in relation to those of the homogeneous background, which having definite singularities, are transformed into Heun’s equation. We point out the existence of quasinormal modes labeled by the accessory parameter of the Heun function. The distribution of the quasinormal modes has been clarified to satisfy the boundary conditions that require ingoing and decaying waves at the event horizon and conformal infinity, respectively. It turned out that the procedure based on the Heun function, beside reproducing the previously known results obtained via hypergeometric function for the BTZ and Lifshitz black hole solution in conformal gravity, brings up new families of quasinormal frequencies, which can also contain purely imaginary modes. Also, the analysis of the quasinormal modes shows that with the negative imaginary part of complex frequencies\(\omega =\omega _{Re}+i\omega _{Im}\), the fermionic perturbations are stable in this background.We investigate the impact of incorporating vector-like leptons into the Standard Model, aiming to address longstanding puzzles related to the anomalous magnetic moments of the muon and electron while maintaining consistency with neutrino masses and mixings. We find that among the various representations of vector-like leptons permitted by the Standard Model gauge symmetry, only weak doublets and singlets offer satisfactory solutions, all associated with a significantly constrained parameter space. Our analysis delves into the associated parameter space, identifying representative benchmark scenarios suitable for collider studies. These setups yield a distinctive six-lepton signature whose associated signals can easily be distinguished from the Standard Model background, providing a clear signal indicative of new physics models featuring vector-like leptons. Our work hence sheds light on the potential implications of vector-like leptons in resolving discrepancies inherent to the Standard Model, while also offering insights into experimental avenues for further exploration.In this paper, the nonfactorizable photonic corrections to the effective four-fermion vertex for the\(\overline{B}\)\({\rightarrow }\)\(D^{({*})}\)\(+\)\({\ell }^{-}\)\(+\)\(\bar{\nu }_{\ell }\)decays are considered at the quark level within SM, where\({\ell }\)\(=\)e,\({\mu }\)and\({\tau }\). It is found that the QED corrections are closely related with the mass of the charged lepton. The QED contributions will enhance branching ratios, which results in the slight reduction of ratios\(R(D^{(*)})\)and the relationship\(R(D^{(*)})_{e}\)<\(R(D^{(*)})_{\mu }\).A particular extension of Einstein’s General Relativity up to and including quartic terms in the curvature tensor is minimal in the sense that it has a unique maximally symmetric vacuum and only a massless spin-2 excitation in its spectrum around the vacuum. We study the inflation phase of the universe in this minimal quartic extension of Einstein’s gravity in the presence of trace anomaly terms coming from the Standard Model fields and the fields of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We show that the theory allows a quasi-de Sitter phase with sufficiente-foldings.This work examines the dynamical mass generation for the photon in Rarita–Schwinger QED. We focus our attention on the cases of\(\omega =2,3\)dimensional spacetime. In these frameworks, it is well known that in the usual QED, the photon field (dynamically) acquires a gauge invariant mass (the Schwinger and Chern–Simons mass, respectively). We wish to scrutinize this phenomenon in terms of the Rarita–Schwinger fields. The presence of higher-derivative terms is shown as the leading contributions to the 1PI function\(\langle AA \rangle \)at one-loop order. We study the pole structure of the photon’s complete propagator to unveil the main effects of the Rarita–Schwinger fields on the photon’s mass. In addition, we present some remarks about the renormalizability of this model (in different dimensions) due to the presence of higher-derivative corrections at one-loop.In this paper, we explore a stationary BTZ space-time within the framework of modified gravity theory, specifically focusing on Ricci-inverse gravity. It is important to clarify that “Ricci-inverse” refers to the inverse of the Ricci tensor, not the Ricci scalar. We consider a general class of this gravity theory, where the functionfis defined by\(f({\mathcal {R}}, {\mathcal {A}}, A^{\mu \nu }\,A_{\mu \nu })\), with\({\mathcal {R}}\)and\({\mathcal {A}}\)representing the Ricci and anti-curvature scalars, respectively and\(A^{\mu \nu }\)is the anti-curvature tensor. We demonstrate that stationary BTZ space-time is a valid solution in this gravity theory, wherein the cosmological constant undergoes modifications due to the coupling constants. Moreover, we study another modified gravity theory known as\(f({\mathcal {R}})\)-gravity and analyze the stationary BTZ space-time. Subsequently, we fully integrate the geodesic equations for BTZ space-time constructed within the Ricci-Inverse gravity, expressing the solutions in terms of elementary functions and compared with the GR result. We classify different types of geodesics, including null and time-like geodesics, under three conditions: (i) nonzero mass and angular momentum,\(M \ne 0, J\ne 0\), (ii) massless BTZ space-time,\(M=0\)and\(J=0\), and (iii)\(M=-1, J=0\), that is\(AdS_3\)-type, and analyze the results in modified gravity theories and compare with the general relativity case.Neutral current Drell–Yan (DY) lepton-pair production is considered to studyZ-boson quark couplings. Using the open-source fit platformxFitter, we investigate the impact of high-statistics measurements of the neutral current DY (NCDY) forward–backward asymmetry\(A_{\textrm{FB}}\)near the weak boson mass scale in the present and forthcoming stages of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Besides recovering earlier results on the\(A_{\textrm{FB}}\)sensitivity to parton distribution functions, we analyze the precision determination ofZ-boson couplings to left-handed and right-handedu-quarks andd-quarks, and explore Beyond-Standard-Model contributions using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. We perform a sensitivity study and comment on the role of the\(A_{\textrm{FB}}\)asymmetry for the electroweak SMEFT fit and precisionZ-boson physics at the LHC and high-luminosity HL-LHC.Charmonium production cross-section in proton–proton collisions is measured at the centre-of-mass energy\(\sqrt{s}=13\,\textrm{TeV}\)using decays to\(p\bar{p}\)final state. The study is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\(2.2\,\textrm{fb}^{-1}\)collected in 2018 with the\(\text{ LHCb }\)detector. The production cross-section of the\(\eta _c\)meson is measured in a rapidity range of\(2.0< y < 4.0\)and in a transverse momentum range of\(5.0< p_{\textrm{T}} < 20.0\,\textrm{GeV}\!/\!{ c}\), which is extended compared with previous\(\text{ LHCb }\)analyses. The differential cross-section is measured in bins of\(p_\mathrm{{T}}\)and, for the first time, ofy. Upper limits, at 90% and 95% confidence levels, on the\(\eta _c(2S)\)and\(h_c(1P)\)prompt production cross-sections are determined for the first time.This paper investigates the structure and stability of wormholes within the framework of Finsler–Barthel–Randers geometry, focusing on the influence of different density models. Finsler geometry, as a generalization of Riemannian geometry, allows for the incorporation of anisotropic characteristics, making it a valuable tool in exploring cosmological phenomena. By employing osculating Riemannian space approaches, we develop wormhole models under non-commutative geometry and power-law energy density distributions. We analyze the role of the Finsler parameter\(\eta \)while evaluating the energy conditions in each model. The specific models developed here with Finsler geometry offer insights into the physical viability of wormholes in this context, potentially resolving some of the longstanding issues in wormhole theory. These findings suggest that Finsler geometry, combined with osculating Barthel–Randers geometry, provides a promising avenue for the construction of stable and physically plausible wormhole structures, The results are validated through analytical solutions and 3-D visualizations, thus contributing to our broader understanding of gravitational physics and spacetime geometry.This research paper delves into examining the Hayward black hole structure surrounded by quintessence within the framework of Finsler geometry. Our focus centers on the Finsler metric tensor development for black holes. This newly derived metric introduces significant deviations from regular black hole metrics found in general relativity due to the Finslerian term\(\gamma \)presence, thus shedding fresh insights into the geometry and nature of black holes. Our findings reveal that the metric structure aligns closely with known Riemannian limits, affirming the congeniality of our model with existing theories. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to derive critical mass values and determine the normalization factor for the Hayward black hole within the Finlserian framework. The study encompasses a detailed description of the horizons and extremal conditions of the Hayward black hole surrounded by quintessence and the impact of the Finsler parameter\(\gamma \)on them. Specifically, we explore the case where the quintessence state parameter is set to\(\omega = -2/3\). Our analysis delves into the effective potential, providing insights into null geodesics for various energy levels and examining the behavior of horizons by utilizing the definition of the effective potential. We also discuss the impact of\(\gamma \)for the same. We compute and analyze the radius of circular orbits, the period, the instability characteristics of circular orbits, and the force acting on photons with the newly introduced parameter\(\gamma \)within the quintessence field. We have thoroughly looked over the obtained results and discussed them. Additionally, we explore the shadow of the black hole in this context. Thereby, the validity and consistency of our Finslerian model are strengthened. In addition to increasing our understanding of black hole physics, this study paves the way for further research in the Finsler geometry domain and its applications in astrophysics.In a recent work (Del Piano et al. in Phys Rev D 109(2):024045, 2024), we have described spherically symmetric and static quantum black holes as deformations of the classical Schwarzschild metric that depend on the physical distance to the horizon. We have developed a framework that allows us to compute the latter in a self-consistent fashion from the deformed geometry, in the vicinity of the horizon. However, in this formalism, the distance can be replaced by other physical quantities, e.g. curvature invariants such as the Ricci- or Kretschmann scalar. Here, we, therefore, define a more general framework, which we call aneffective metric description(EMD), that captures the deformed geometry based on a generic physical quantity. We develop in detail the Ricci- and Kretschmann scalar EMD, in particular demonstrating how to compute the geometry in a self-consistent manner. Moreover, we provide explicit relations that allow us to express one EMD  in terms of the others, thus demonstrating their equivalence.The singularity problem has always been a key focus of physicists’ research. To address this issue, Penrose proposed the cosmic censorship conjecture, with the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (SCCC) being particularly crucial. However, verifying SCCC in different scenarios still faces many challenges. This paper, set against the background of short-hair black holes, explores whether they obey SCCC when subjected to scalar field perturbations. Using the WKB method, Prony method, Lyapunov exponent, and Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), the behavior of a short-hair black hole under different parameter conditions was systematically analyzed. Numerical results indicate that as the charge\( Q \)of the short-hair black hole approaches its extremal value, the SCCC is violated. However, as the order\( k \)of the metric equation and the angular quantum number\( \ell \)increase, the violation of SCCC is delayed. These results suggest that the proximity of the black hole’s charge\( Q \)to its extremal value, along with the size of the angular quantum number\( \ell \)and the order\( k \), play key roles in exploring the physical properties of black holes and verifying SCCC. Finally, research using the WGC shows that when the charge-to-mass ratio in a scalar field meets certain conditions, short-hair black holes can still comply with the SCCC under extreme conditions. This study not only reveals the behavior of short-hair black holes in extreme situations but also offers a new perspective for further exploration of such black holes.Interest on the possible future scenarios the universe could have has grew substantially with breakthroughs on late-time acceleration. Holographic dark energy (HDE) presents a very interesting approach towards addressing late-time acceleration, presenting an intriguing interface of ideas from quantum gravity and cosmology. In this work we present an extensive discussion of possible late-time scenarios, focusing on rips and similar events, in a universe with holographic dark energy. We discuss these events in the realm of the generalized Nojiri–Odintsov cutoff and also for the more primitive holographic cutoffs like Hubble, particle and event horizon cutoffs. We also discuss the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics and various energy conditions in these regimes. Our work points towards the idea that it is not possible to have alternatives of the big rip consistently in the simpler HDE cutoffs, and shows the flexibility of the generalized HDE cutoff as well.I study an extended theory of General Relativity that incorporates normalized relativistic velocities, where the boundary terms in the variedf(R)-action are considered as a part of the physical system to be studied. Within this context, I investigate how the classical perturbations can be originated by quantum geometric perturbations, that alters the dynamics of the physical system without perturbations. To do it we use a modified nonlinear quantum algebra recently introduced. The quantum field perturbations of space-time also alter the geodesic equations that describe the dynamics of the relativistic  velocities, the metric tensor and the Ricci tensor. But perhaps the most intriguing of this phenomena is that these space-time alterations change the effective number of space-time dimensions of the system with perturbations includedN(z), in a such manner thatN(z) can take an irrational value\(N(z=2)=8/(1+\sqrt{5})\simeq 2.4721\), when the nonlinear quantum perturbations of space-time are related to the relativistic velocities\(\bar{U}^{\mu }\). To illustrate the theory, we calculate exactly the cosmological parameter in an early inflationary universe.In this work, we have studied the vector scotogenic model in the context of the dark matter problem. Due to unitarity considerations, we have focused on the scenario with fermion dark matter, finding out that co-annihilations play a fundamental role in achieving dark matter relic abundance. Moreover, the coannihilation effects allow to separate the parameter space into two regions with different phenomenology. In addition, we have studied the detection prospects of these regions separately, focusing on signatures that can appear in lepton flavor violating decays, indirect and direct searches, and the production of these new particles at collider facilities.Recent conjectures on the complexity of black holes suggest that their evolution manifests in the structural properties of Einstein-Rosen bridges, like the length and volume. The complexity of black holes relates to the computational complexity of their dual, namely holographic, quantum systems identified via the Gauge/Gravity duality framework. Interestingly, the latter allows us to study the evolution of a black hole as the transformation of a qubit collection performed through a quantum circuit. In this work, we focus on the complexity of Einstein-Rosen bridges. More in detail, we start with a preliminary discussion about their computational properties, and then we aim to assess whether an Ising-like model could represent their holographic dual. In this regard, we recall that the Ising model captures essential aspects of complex phenomena such as phase transitions and, in general, is deeply related to information processing systems. To perform this assessment, which relies on a heuristic model, we attempt to describe the dynamics of information relating to an Einstein-Rosen bridge encoded in a holographic screen in terms of dynamics occurring in a spin lattice at low temperatures. We conclude by discussing our observations and related implications.We construct a new class of\((n+1)\)-dimensional Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions in the presence of the cubic quasitopological gravity for a flat boundary. The related action supports asymptotically Lifshitz solutions by applying some conditions which are used throughout the paper. We have to add a new boundary term and some new counterterms to the bulk action to have finite solutions. Then we define a finite stress tensor complex by which we can calculate the energy density of the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. It is not possible to obtain analytical solutions, and so we use some expansions to probe -the behaviors of the functions, both near the horizon and, at the infinity. Combining the equations, we can attain a total constant along the coordinater. At the horizon, this constant is proportional to the product of the temperature and the entropy and at the infinity, the total constant shows the energydensity of the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. Therefore, we can reach a relation between the conserved quantities temperature, entropy and the energy density and get a smarr-type formula. Using the first law of thermodynamics, we can find a relation between the entropy and the temperature and then obtain the heat capacity. Our results show that the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions are thermally stable for each positive value of the dynamical critiacl exponent,z.The projected sensitivity of the effective electron neutrino-mass measurement with the KATRIN experiment is below 0.3 eV (90 % CL) after 5 years of data acquisition. The sensitivity is affected by the increased rate of the background electrons from KATRIN’s main spectrometer. A special shifted-analysing-plane (SAP) configuration was developed to reduce this background by a factor of two. The complex layout of electromagnetic fields in the SAP configuration requires a robust method of estimating these fields. We present in this paper a dedicated calibration measurement of the fields using conversion electrons of gaseous\(^\textrm{83m}\)Kr, which enables the neutrino-mass measurements in the SAP configuration.In order to investigate how the drag force is affected by translational symmetry breaking (TSB), we utilize a holographic model in which the background metric remains translational symmetric while a graviton mass or other fields in the theory break this symmetry. We calculate analytically the drag force, considering an asymptotic\(\hbox {AdS}_5\)in which parameter\(\alpha \)arises from TSB. This parameter can be intuitively understood as a measure of TSB strength and we anticipate that non-zero values of it will affect the drag force. In this asymptotic\(\hbox {AdS}_5\)background, we will demonstrate that a decrease in\(\alpha \)results in a reduction of the drag force. Moreover, we study the diffusion constant, which falls with increasing\(\alpha \). It will eventually be shown that at lower values of\(\alpha \)or\(\mu \)(chemical potential), the transverse diffusion coefficient is larger than the longitudinal one, and the speed of the heavy quark has minimal impact on the ratio.The polarizabilities of light pseudoscalar mesons can be extracted from differential cross sections for Compton scattering near threshold. While this has been accomplished for charged pions employing Primakoff reactions, a corresponding measurement for kaons will be affected by the presence of the\(K^*(892)\)resonance not too far from threshold. We propose a method to extend the energy range serviceable for this purpose by reconstructing the\(K^*(892)\)contribution model-independently from its\(K\pi \)intermediate state, using dispersion theory. We point out that, in contrast to the charged-pion analog, there is likely no strong hierarchy between sum and difference of electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities; we discuss the sensitivity to disentangling both by improved experimental angular coverage.The scalar mode describing the fluctuation of the 3-brane (the observable universe) in a five-dimensional bulk spacetime compactified on a circle is absorbed by the Kaluza–Klein U(1) gauge field, leading to a massive brane-vector living on the 3-brane. The brane-vector can be responsible for dark matter because it is odd under a\(\textrm{Z}_2\)symmetry, neutral under the Standard Model (SM) symmetries, and couples extremely weak to the SM particles due to its gravitational origin. Interestingly, the brane-vector dark matter could leave particular imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the primordial gravitational waves. Hence, the precise measurements of the CMB and the observations of the primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation can provide a potential way to probe the extra-dimensions and branes which are the main ingredients of string/M theory.Examining the\(\phi ^{4}\)and\(\phi ^{8}\)models within a two-dimensional framework in the flat spacetime and embracing a theory with unconventional kinetic terms, one investigates the emergence of kinks/antikinks and double-kinks/antikinks. We devote our study to obtaining the field configurations with minimal energy, i.e., solutions possessing a Bogomol’nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield’s bound. Next, to accomplish our goal, we adopt non-polynomial generalizing functions, namely, hyperbolic sine and cosine functions: the first produce BPS potentials exhibiting a minimum at\(\phi =0\), facilitating the emergence of genuine double-kink-type configurations. Conversely, the second promotes the rise of kink-type solutions.A search is reported for charge-parity\(CP\)violation in\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} \)decays, using data collected in proton–proton collisions at\(\sqrt{s} = 13\,\text {Te}\hspace{-.08em}\text {V} \)recorded by the CMS experiment in 2018. The analysis uses a dedicated data set that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 41.6\(\,\text {fb}^{-1}\), which consists of about 10 billion events containing a pair of b hadrons, nearly all of which decay to charm hadrons. The flavor of the neutral D meson is determined by the pion charge in the reconstructed decays\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{*+}}} \rightarrow {{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} {{{\mathrm{\uppi }}}^{{+}}} \)and\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{*-}}} \rightarrow {\overline{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} {{{\mathrm{\uppi }}}^{{-}}} \). The\(CP\)asymmetry in\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} \)is measured to be\(A_{CP} ({{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} ) = (6.2 \pm 3.0 \pm 0.2 \pm 0.8)\%\), where the three uncertainties represent the statistical uncertainty, the systematic uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the measurement of the\(CP\)asymmetry in the\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} {{{\mathrm{\uppi }}}^{{+}}} {{{\mathrm{\uppi }}}^{{-}}} \)decay. This is the first\(CP\)asymmetry measurement by CMS in the charm sector as well as the first to utilize a fully hadronic final state.We propose a consistent framework with theU(1) Peccei–Quinn (PQ) symmetry for obtaining the initial condition for axion kinetic misalignment from inflation. We introduce a PQ complex scalar field and an extra Higgs doublet, which are conformally coupled to gravity, and three right-handed neutrinos for the seesaw mechanism. In the DFSZ type scenarios for the axion, we obtain the PQ anomalies from the Standard Model quarks carrying nonzero PQ charges in some of two Higgs doublet models, solving the strong CP problem by the QCD potential for the axion. Assuming that the PQ symmetry is explicitly violated in the scalar potential by quantum gravity effects, we show that a sufficiently large initial axion velocity can be obtained before the QCD phase transition while avoiding the axion quality problem. As inflation is driven by the radial distance from the origin in the space of scalar fields close to the pole of the kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, we obtain successful inflationary predictions and set the initial axion velocity at the end of inflation. Focusing on the pure PQ inflation with a small running quartic coupling for the PQ field, we discuss the post-inflationary dynamics for the inflaton and the axion. As a result, we show that a sufficiently high reheating temperature can be obtained dominantly from the Higgs-portal couplings to the PQ field, while being consistent with axion kinetic misalignment, the stability for the Higgs fields during inflation and the non-restoration of the PQ symmetry after reheating.General expressions for one-loop contributions associated with lepton-flavor violating decays of the standard model-like Higgs boson\(h\rightarrow e_b^\pm e_a^\mp \)and gauge boson\(Z\rightarrow e^\pm _b e_a^\mp \)are introduced in the unitary gauge. The results are used to discuss these decays as new physics signals in a minimal left-right symmetric model containing only one bidoublet Higgs and a\(SU(2)_R\)Higgs doublet accommodating data of neutrino oscillations and\((g-2)_{\mu }\). The numerical investigation indicates that some of these decay rates can reach near future experimental sensitivities.We study supersymmetric solutions of matter-coupledF(4) gauged supergravity in the forms of\(AdS_2\times S^3\)- and\(AdS_3\times S^2\)-sliced domain walls with a non-vanishing two-form field from the supergravity multiplet. These two types of solutions holographically describe conformal line and surface defects within five-dimensional\(N=2\)SCFTs, respectively. In the case of\(SO(3)\times SO(3)\)gauge group obtained by couplingF(4) supergravity to three vector multiplets, we find charged domain wall solutions describing holographic RG flows between two supersymmetric\(AdS_6\)vacua with a running two-form field supporting the line and surface defects. For a particular case of one vector multiplet with\(SO(3)\times U(1)\)gauge group, we find solutions describing RG flows from an\(AdS_6\)vacuum to physically acceptable singular geometries in the presence of defects. This class of solutions can be uplifted to type IIB theory using a consistent truncation obtained fromSO(5, 5) exceptional field theory with half-maximal structures.The CONUS+experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE\(\nu \)NS) of reactor antineutrinos on germanium nuclei in the fully coherent regime, continuing on this way the CONUS physics program started at the Brokdorf nuclear power plant, Germany. The CONUS+setup is installed in the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland, at a distance of 20.7 m from the 3.6 GW thermal power reactor core. The CE\(\nu \)NS signature will be measured with the same four point-contact high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors produced for the former experiment, however refurbished and with optimized low energy thresholds of about 160\(\hbox {eV}_{ee}\). To suppress the background in the CONUS+detectors, the passive and active layers of the original CONUS shield were modified such to fit better to the significantly changed background conditions at the new experimental location. New data acquisition and monitoring systems were developed. A direct network connection between the experiment and the Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik (MPIK) makes it possible to control and monitor data acquisition in real time. The impact of all these modifications is discussed with particular emphasis on the resulting CE\(\nu \)NS signal prediction for the first data collection phase of CONUS+. Prospects of the planned upgrade in a second phase integrating new larger HPGe detectors are also discussed.We investigate the effects of a gravitational wave background on the coherence degradation induced by the Unruh effect of a uniformly accelerated single-qubit and quantum interferometric circuit. In both systems, we use the formalism of the evolution of the density matrix of the detector-field system, where after the interaction the field degrees of freedom are traced out to obtain the reduced density matrix of the detector. In this background, we calculate the quantum coherence and interferometric visibility in the long-wavelength regime and large interaction time. Our results indicate that the gravitational wave transfers energy to the internal states of the detector, causing, together with the Unruh effect, changes in them, amplifying the coherence degradation of the system. This amplification occurs when the polarization modes of the gravitational wave are in resonance and have modulated amplitudes. For the case of a short-wavelength, the detector does not respond to the gravitational wave because its oscillation is so fast that the detector does not have time to respond within the system timescale. Therefore, it is possible to detect the signature of gravitational waves in the coherence degradation induced by the Unruh effect within the regimes studied here.In this work, we study timelike and lightlike geodesics in Kalb–Ramond (KR) gravity around a black hole with the goal of constraining the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameterl. The analysis involves studying the precession of the S2 star periastron orbiting Sgr A* and geodesic precession around the Earth. The ratio of precession frequencies for General Relativity (GR) and KR gravity is computed, with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results providing a parameter range for the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of\(-0.185022 \le l \le 0.060938\). Utilizing the geodesic precession frequency from the Gravity Probe B (GP-B), thelparameter is further constrained to\(-6.30714 \times 10^{-12} \le l \le 3.90708 \times 10^{-12}\), which is consistent with the Schwarzschild limits. Moreover, for timelike geodesics, the innermost circular orbit (ICO) and innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are determined and analyzed to illustrate the impact of the symmetry breaking term. Zoom-whirl obstructions are compared with the Schwarzschild solution. Lower and upper limits of the photon sphere for lightlike geodesics are established to demonstrate the influence of KR gravity on the photon sphere. Additionally, the shadow radius is determined for two observers, one situated at a finite distance from the KR black hole, and the other located at an infinite distance, to constrain the symmetry-breaking parameterl, with comparisons made to EHT results. The bounds forlderived from constraints on the photon sphere radius for lightlike geodesics yield\(-0.0700225 \le l \le 0.189785\)using EHT data. The findings of this paper align with experimental results in the\(l \rightarrow 0\)limit.We discuss a general prototypical constrained Hamiltonian system with a broad application in quantum field theory and similar contexts where dynamics is defined through a functional action obeying a stationarity principle. The prototypical model amounts to a Dirac–Bergmann singular system, whose constraints restrict the actual dynamics to occur within a differential submanifold, as is the case in the major part of field theoretical models with gauge symmetry. We apply the Dirac–Bergmann algorithm in its full generality unraveling a total of 4msecond-class constraints and obtain the corresponding Dirac brackets algebra in phase space. We follow with the Faddeev–Jackiw–Barcelos–Wotzasek approach in which the geometric character of the mentioned submanifold is emphasized by means of an internal metric function encoding its symplectic properties. We consider two straightforward examples, applying our general results to constrained motion along a toroidal geometry and to a Lorentz violating toy model in field theory. Since toroidal geometry has been recently used in cosmological models, we suggest how our results could lead to different proposals for the shape of the universe in cosmology.We revisit an economical model for the\(g-2\)anomaly featuring a vector-like charged fermion, a scalar doublet and a scalar singlet in the light of new results from Fermilab. The phenomenological implications for lepton-flavor universality, Higgs decays, and charged lepton-flavor violating decays are discussed in detail.AbstractIn this paper, a preliminary ballistic analysis for an Earth magnetosphere monitoring mission is conducted. Spacecraft mass and propulsion system characteristics are specified to satisfy current technological requirements. Low Earth, Sun-synchronous, and geosynchronous transfer orbits are considered as initial orbits. The target orbits are specified in accordance with scientific tasks. The fuel cost and transfer duration are estimated by two methods: an upper bound from the Lyapunov control method and a lower bound from energy-optimal control problem solution. The relationship between optimal longitudes of the ascending nodes for initial and target orbits is examined. The fuel cost estimates validate the feasibility of the mission based on small spacecraft and on the market low-thrust electric engines.AbstractWave trains of magnetic field and ion-flux oscillations generated upstream of the ramp of interplanetary (IP) shock were studied according to BMSW plasma-spectrometer measurements of energy–time spectra of the solar-wind ions supplemented by magnetic-field measurements. It was shown that oscillations of the magnetic field upstream of the ramp of IP shock are accompanied by oscillations of the ion flux. A detailed analysis of two cases is carried out, and the results of statistical study are presented. Right-handed circular or elliptical polarization was observed in all wave trains of magnetic-field oscillations, which is consistent with the characteristics of magnetosonic oscillations corresponding to the low-frequency branch of whistler waves. It was obtained that the mean angles between the propagation direction of whistler waves relative to the magnetic field and shock normal direction were 31° and 40°, respectively. This result suggests that the wave packets upstream of the ramp of IP shock had the properties of propagating whistler waves. It was found that, on average, with an increase in the angle of propagation of whistler waved relative to the shock normal direction θkn, the angle between the wave vector and magnetic-field direction θkBdecreases.AbstractMeasurements of heavy (M/q> 3) ions on thePhobos-2satellite revealed that the density of these ions in the central plasma sheet of the areomagnetic tail is proportional to the proton density of the solar wind flowing around the planet.ISEE-2ion measurements in the near-Earth plasma sheet close to the neutral line were also compared to solar wind data obtained on theISEE-3satellite. It was found that the density of protons in the near-Earth plasma sheet is proportional to the density of solar wind protons as well. Analysis of the magnetic and plasma pressure balance in the solar wind and inside the magnetotails of the Earth and Mars showed that the previously found correlations are the result of the necessary equality of pressures at the magnetosphere boundary and inside the magnetic tails of the planets.AbstractThe lunar surface in the vicinity of the poles has special properties compared to the surface at the equator and at moderate latitudes. First, the polar regolith contains quite a large amount of water ice, which significantly affects the neutron radiation generated under the influence of galactic cosmic rays. Second, the temperature of the polar regolith can have extremely low values of about 25 K, as a result of which the thermal component of the neutron flux is partially held in the gravitational field. Based on numerical modeling of neutron radiation from the lunar surface, its main features were shown for the polar regions compared to the equatorial ones: a significant decrease in the ratio of epithermal and thermal neutron fluxes due to an increase in the concentration of hydrogen in the regolith, as well as a significant increase in the density of thermal neutrons near the surface due to gravitational capture.This paper formulates three different analytical solutions to the gravitational field equations in the framework of Rastall theory by taking into account the gravitational decoupling approach. For this, the anisotropic spherical interior fluid distribution is assumed as a seed source characterized by the corresponding Lagrangian. The field equations are then modified by introducing an additional source which is gravitationally coupled with the former fluid setup. Since this approach makes the Rastall equations more complex, the MGD scheme is used to tackle this, dividing these equations into two systems. Some particular ansatz are taken into account to solve the first system, describing initial anisotropic fluid. These metric potentials contain multiple constants which are determined with the help of boundary conditions. On the other hand, the solution for the second set is calculated through different well-known constraints. Afterwards, the estimated data of a pulsar 4U 1820-30 is considered so that the feasibility of the developed models can be checked graphically. It is concluded that all resulting models show physically acceptable behavior under certain choices of Rastall and decoupling parameters.Recently, the Belle and LHCb Collaborations have measured the\(\Lambda ^+_c \rightarrow p K^- \pi ^+\)decay and reported the\(K^- p\)invariant mass distribution, which shows a clear cusp structure around the\(\eta \Lambda \)threshold. In this work, we have analyzed this process by considering the triangle mechanism and theS-wave pseudoscalar meson-octet baryon interactions within the chiral unitary approach, which dynamically generates the\(\Lambda (1670)\). Our results are in good agreement with the Belle measurements, which implies that the cusp structure around\(\eta \Lambda \)threshold could be associated with the\(\Lambda (1670)\)with the molecular nature.AbstractWe reportMagnetospheric Multiscale Mission(MMS) observations of accelerated field-aligned electron beams in the outer (\(\left| {{{B}_{x}}} \right| \sim \left( {10{\kern 1pt} - {\kern 1pt} 20} \right)\,\,{\text{nT}}\)) regions of the Plasma Sheet (PS). TheMMSsatellites were located earthward of the magnetic reconnectionX-line, inside of the bursty bulk flow. The interval corresponds to the growth phase of the substorm. Field-aligned electron beams was produced by electrons suprathermal population with energy\( \sim {\kern 1pt} \left( {1{\kern 1pt} - {\kern 1pt} 5} \right)\,\,{\text{keV}}\). Newly accelerated electron beams are gyrotropic. In the process of evolution, agyrotropy of the beam develops. This leads to the generation of intense (up to ∼80 nA/m2) field-aligned currents. We demonstrate that acceleration of the electrons is pulsed for the time\( < {\kern 1pt} 5\,\,~{\text{s}}\). Propagation of the high-velocity electron beam results in the development of plasma instabilities and generation of a strong (∼59 mV/m) nonideal electric field at frequencies lower than electron cyclotron frequency\({{{{\omega }}}_{{c,e}}}\). The presence of a nonideal electric field leads to the violation of the frozen-in condition of electron plasma and energy dissipation. The energy transformation power density reaches ∼–1000 pW/m3. Fluctuations in the spectrum of a nonideal electric field experience spectral flattering between ion plasma\({{{{\omega }}}_{{p,i}}}\)and electron cyclotron\({{{{\omega }}}_{{c,e}}}\)frequencies. This evidences energy transfer from particles to waves at this spectral range. The studied phenomena may provide significant contributions to the development of turbulence on electronic kinetic scales in the outer region of the PS.We propose extended 3HDM and 4HDM models where the SM gauge symmetry is enlarged by the spontaneously broken\(S_4\)group, the preserved\(Z_2\)and broken\(Z_4\)cyclic symmetries. Each model has three activeSU(2) scalar doublets, in addition, the first one has an extra inert scalar singlet, whereas the second model has an inert scalar doublet. Furthermore, each model has several extra gauge singlet scalars, which are triplets under\(S_4\). Both models yield the same structure of the mass matrices for the fermion sector, where a radiative seesaw generates the tiny light active neutrino masses at one-loop level, through the\(S_4\)triplets. The presence of flavor changing neutral currents mediated by heavy scalars allowed us to study the\((K^0-\overline{K}^0)\)and\((B_{d,s}^0-\overline{B}_{d,s}^0)\)meson mixings, in the parameter space that currently satisfies the experimental constraints. On the other hand, due to the preserved\(Z_2\)symmetry, our proposed models have stable scalar and fermionic dark matter candidates. Furthermore, these models are consistent with the current pattern of SM fermion masses and mixings, with the measured dark matter relic abundance and successfully accommodate the constraints arising from meson oscillations and oblique parameters. The extra scalars in our models provide radiative corrections to the oblique parameters, where due to the presence of the scalar inert doublet, renders the 4HDM less restrictive than the 3HDM one.An extension of thexFitteropen-source program for QCD analyses is presented, allowing for a polynomial parameterization of the dependence of physical observables on theoretical parameters. This extension enables simultaneous determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and new physics parameters within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The functionalities of the code are illustrated in a sensitivity study, where a simultaneous determination of the PDFs, top quark mass and the couplings of selected dimension-6 SMEFT operators is addressed using projections for measurements of top quark-antiquark pair production at the High-Luminosity LHC. The importance of considering all the correlations of the parton distributions, top quark mass and the SMEFT parameters in a simultaneous QCD+SMEFT analysis is demonstrated. This work serves as a new platform for simultaneous extraction of the PDFs and the SM/SMEFT parameters based onxFitter.In the present work, we propose to explore the productions of the bottom and bottom-strange mesons in the high-energy pion and kaon-induced reactions on a proton target. The cross sections are evaluated with an effective Lagrangian constructed by the heavy-quark limit and chiral symmetry. Our estimations show that at\(P_\pi =80\)GeV, the cross sections forB(5279),\(B^*(5325)\),\(B_0^*(5722)\),\(B_1^\prime (5716)\),\(B_1(5721)\)and\(B_2^*(5747)\)production processes are estimated to be 3.19–86.26, 1.86–51.29, 0.88–24.33, 0.86–23.69, 162.35–4477.66, and 57.16–1604.43 nb, respectively, where uncertainties arise from the model parameter. In addition, the cross sections for the corresponding bottom-strange mesons production processes are very similar. From the heavy quark effective theory point of view, the ratios between the cross sections for bottom mesons and bottom-strange mesons should be similar and the present estimations are consistent with the expectation of heavy quark limit. In particular, the cross-section ratios related to the states in the same doublets are of order one. The cross sections related to the states in theTdoublets are about two orders larger than those related to the states in theSdoublets.The gravitational field around an astrophysical black hole (BH) is thought to be described by the Kerr spacetime, which is a solution of the Einstein equation. Signatures of binary black hole (BBH) coalescence in gravitational waves (GW) follow the Kerr spacetime as the theoretical foundation. Hence, any possible deviations from the Kerr spacetime around BHs serve as a test of the nature of gravity in the strong-field regime and of the predictions of General Relativity. In our study, we perform a theory-agnostic test of the Kerr hypothesis using BBH inspirals from the third Gravitational-wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). Considering the Johannsen metric, we compute the leading-order deviation to the emitted GW in the frequency domain. Our results provide constraints on two deformation parameters (\(\alpha _{13}\)and\(\epsilon _3\)) and demonstrate the degeneracy between these two non-Kerr parameters.The regime of dark matter (DM) freeze-in at stronger coupling interpolates between freeze-in and freeze-out. It relies on Boltzmann-suppressed dark matter production, implying that the Standard Model bath temperature never exceeds the dark matter mass. In this work, we study this regime in the context of sterile neutrino dark matter, which can be sufficiently long-lived for a tiny sterile-active mixing. The sterile neutrino is assumed to couple to a real singlet scalar, providing for a thermal production mechanism of the former. We find that DM mass can range from GeV to tens of TeV consistently with all the constraints. The most interesting aspect of the consequent freeze-in phenomenology is that the sterile neutrino dark matter can be probed efficiently by both direct detection experiments and invisible Higgs decay at the LHC.In this paper we investigate the shear viscoelasticity and the hydrodynamic modes in a holographic solid model with several sets of axions that all break the translations spontaneously on boundary. Comparing with the single-axion model, the shear modulus is enhanced at high temperatures and the shear viscosity is always suppressed in the presence of additional axions. However, the different sets of axions exhibit competitive relationship in determining the shear modulus at low temperatures. Furthermore, by calculating the black hole quasi-normal modes, it is found that adding more axions only increases the amount of diffusive modes. The number of the sound modes always remains unchanged.This research paper investigates the impact of non-metricity and matter source on the geometry of charged spheres in the presence of anisotropic matter configuration. We use a specific model of extended symmetric teleparallel theory to minimize the complexity of the field equations. Moreover, the feasible non-singular solutions are used to examine the interior composition of the charged spheres. The Darmois junction conditions are used to determine the unknown constants in the metric coefficients. We explore some significant properties in the interior of compact stars under consideration to check their viable existence in this modified framework. The equilibrium state of the charged spheres is discussed using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation and stability is analyzed by sound speed and Herrera cracking approach. We find that the charged spheres in this theoretical framework are physically viable and stable.In order to search for new solutions for collapsed objects in quantum gravity, we consider in this paper a Kantowski–Sachs metric labelled by parameters that have no classical significance. In addition, we include a Klein–Gordon field to represent in a simple manner the inevitable zero-point vacuum fluctuations that permeate the spacetime. With this framework, we quantize the system and obtain the Wheeler–DeWitt equation in order to focus upon the deep quantum regime of the interior and to analyze any kind of transition that the black hole may undergo. The Wheeler–DeWitt equation reveals the existence of new solutions of different nature, designated herein as “quantum grey holes,” in addition to the existence of quantum black holes, with all solutions satisfying the DeWitt boundary condition. The existence of new solutions gives rise to the novel possibility of a quantum black hole making a transition to a quantum grey hole. We find that there exists non-zero probability of quantum black-to-grey hole transition. These transition probabilities exhibit resonances for a continuous range of eigenvalues of the system.Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, as suggested by recent observations, seems to challenge this model, as such galaxies would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars. However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshiftz= 4.90, 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal that the stellar mass of the galaxy of 1011M⊙formed in a short 200 Myr burst of star formation, after which star formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than assumed at present.Complex quantum information tasks in a gravitational background require multipartite entanglement for effective processing. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the properties of multipartite entanglement in a relativistic setting. In this paper, we study genuine N-partite entanglement of massless Dirac fields in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, characterized by the presence of a black hole event horizon (BEH) and a cosmological event horizon (CEH). We obtain the general analytical expression of genuine N-partite entanglement shared bynobservers near BEH andm(\(n+m=N\)) observers near CEH. It is shown that genuine N-partite entanglement monotonically decreases with the decrease of the mass of the black hole, suggesting that the Hawking effect of the black hole destroys quantum entanglement. It is interesting to note that genuine N-partite entanglement is a non-monotonic function of the cosmological constant, meaning that the Hawking effect of the expanding universe can enhance quantum entanglement. This result contrasts with multipartite entanglement in single-event horizon spacetime, offering a new perspective on the Hawking effect in multi-event horizon spacetime.In the present work we determine the eight form factors of the transversely-projected quark-gluon vertex in general kinematics, in the context of Landau-gauge QCD with two degenerate light dynamical quarks. The study is based on the set of Schwinger–Dyson equations that govern the vertex form factors, derived within the formalism of the three-particle-irreducible (3PI) effective action. The analysis is performed by employing lattice data for the main ingredients, such as gluon and quark propagators, and three-gluon vertex. The numerical treatment is simplified by decoupling the system of integral equations: the classical form factor is determined from a single non-linear equation involving only itself, while the remaining ones are subsequently computed through simple integrations. The form factors are obtained for arbitrary values of space-like momenta, and their angular dependence is examined in detail. A clear hierarchy is established at the level of the corresponding dimensionless effective couplings, in agreement with results of earlier studies. Furthermore, the classical form factor is found to be in excellent agreement with recent unquenched lattice data in the soft-gluon configuration, while the two non-classical dressings depart substantially from the lattice results. Finally, the accurate implementation of multiplicative renormalizability is confirmed, and the transition from Minkoswski to Euclidean space is elucidated.Recently, the short-distance asymptotics of the generating functional ofn-point correlators of twist-2 operators in SU(N) Yang–Mills (YM) theory has been worked out in Bochicchio et al. (Phys Rev D 108:054023, 2023). The above computation relies on a basis change of renormalized twist-2 operators, where\(-\gamma (g)/ \beta (g)\)reduces to\(\gamma _0/ (\beta _0\,g)\)to all orders of perturbation theory, with\(\gamma _0\)diagonal,\(\gamma (g) = \gamma _0 g^2+\cdots \)the anomalous-dimension matrix and\(\beta (g) = -\beta _0 g^3+\cdots \)the beta function. The construction is based on a novel geometric interpretation of operator mixing (Bochicchio in Eur Phys J C 81:749, 2021), under the assumption that the eigenvalues of the matrix\(\gamma _0/ \beta _0\)satisfy the nonresonant condition\(\lambda _i-\lambda _j\ne 2k\), with\(\lambda _i\)in nonincreasing order and\(k\in {\mathbb {N}}^+\). The nonresonant condition has been numerically verified up to\(i,j=10^4\)in Bochicchio et al. (Phys Rev D 108:054023, 2023). In the present paper we provide a number theoretic proof of the nonresonant condition for twist-2 operators essentially based on the classic result that Harmonic numbers are not integers. Our proof in YM theory can be extended with minor modifications to twist-2 operators in\(\mathcal {N}=1\)SUSY YM theory, large-NQCD with massless quarks and massless QCD-like theories.We derive a class of Taub-NUT metrics in the presence of a scalar field (TNS) by using Ernst equations and potential, as well as using Ehlers transformations on the exact solutions that was recently introduced in Azizallahi et al. (Nucl Phys B 998:116414,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2023.116414,arXiv:2307.09328[gr-qc], 2023) and Mirza et al. (Eur Phys J C 83:1161,https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-12255-7,arXiv:2307.13588[gr-qc], 2023). Furthermore, we investigate the effective potential, geodesics, topological charge, quasinormal modes (QNMs) and the deflection angle of light in a gravitational lensing for the obtained class of TNS metrics. We also use conformal transformations to generate a new class of exact solutions of the Einstein-conformal-scalar theory by using the obtained TNS solutions as seed metrics. Finally we compare QNMs of the class of exact solutions.The origin of tiny neutrino mass is an unsolved puzzle leading to a variety of phenomenological aspects beyond the Standard Model (BSM). We considerU(1) gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM) where so-called seesaw mechanism is incarnated with the help of thee generations of Majorana type right-handed neutrinos followed by the breaking ofU(1) and electroweak gauge symmetries providing anomaly free structure. In this framework, a neutral BSM gauge boson\(Z^\prime \)is evolved. To explore the properties of its interactions we consider chiral (flavored) frameworks where\(Z^\prime \)interactions depend on the handedness (generations) of the fermions. In this paper we focus on\(Z^\prime \)-neutrino interactions which could be probed from cosmic explosions. We consider\(\nu \overline{\nu } \rightarrow e^+ e^-\)process which can energize gamma-ray burst (GRB221009A, so far the highest energy) through energy deposition. Hence estimating these rates we constrainU(1) gauge coupling\((g_X)\)and\(Z^\prime \)mass\((M_{Z^\prime })\)under Schwarzchild (Sc) and Hartle-Thorne (HT) scenarios. We also study\(\nu \)-DM scattering through\(Z^\prime \)to constrain\(g_X-M_{Z^\prime }\)plane using IceCube data considering high energy neutrinos from cosmic blazar (TXS0506+056), active galaxy (NGC1068), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the Lyman-\(\alpha \)data, respectively. Finally highlighting complementarity we compare our results with current and prospective bounds on\(g_X-M_{Z^\prime }\)plane from scattering, beam-dump and\(g-2\)experiments. [PICS code].The standard cosmological model, based on Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy (\(\varLambda \)CDM), faces several challenges. Among these is the need to adjust the scenario to account for the presence of vast voids in the large-scale structure of the universe, as well as the early formation of the first stars and galaxies. Additionally, the observed matter–antimatter asymmetry in the universe remains an unresolved issue. To address this latter question, Andrei Sakharov proposed a twin universe model in 1967. Building upon this idea and introducing interactions between these two universe sheets through a bimetric model, we propose an alternative interpretation of the large-scale structure of the universe, including its voids and the acceleration of cosmic expansion.This Letter proposes a new signature for confining dark sectors at the LHC. Under the assumption of a QCD-like hidden sector, hadronic jets containing stable dark bound states originating from hidden strong dynamics, known as semi-visible jets, could manifest in proton-proton collisions. In the proposed simplified model, a heavy\(Z'\)mediator coupling to SM quarks allows the resonant production of dark quarks, subsequently hadronizing in stable and unstable dark bound states. The unstable dark bound states can then decay back to SM quarks via the same\(Z'\)portal or photons via a lighter pseudo-scalar portal (such as an axion-like particle). This mechanism creates a new signature where semi-visible jets are enriched in non-isolated photons. We show that these exotic jets evade the phase space probed by current LHC searches exploiting jets or photons due to the expected high jet neutral electromagnetic fraction and photons candidates non-isolation, respectively. In the proposed analysis strategy to tackle such signature, we exploit jets as final state objects to represent the underlying QCD-like hidden sector. We show that, by removing any selection on the neutral electromagnetic fraction from the jet identification criteria, higher signal efficiency can be reached. To enhance the signal-to-background discrimination, we train a deep neural network as a jet tagger that exploits differences in the substructure of signal and background jets. We estimate that with the available triggers for Run 2 and this new strategy, a high mass search can claim a\(5 \sigma \)discovery (exclusion) of the\(Z'\)boson with a mass up to 5 TeV (5 TeV) with the full Run 2 data of the LHC when the fraction of unstable dark hadrons decaying to photons pairs is around\({30}{\%}\), and with a coupling of the\(Z'\)to SM quarks of 0.25.Aerosols in Jupiter’s stratosphere form intriguing polar hoods, which have been investigated by ultraviolet cameras on Cassini and the Hubble Space Telescope. Transient, concentrated dark ovals of unknown origin have been noted within both the northern and southern polar hoods. However, a systematic comparative study of their properties, which could elucidate the physical processes active at the poles, has not yet been performed due to infrequent observations. Using 26 global maps of Jupiter taken by Hubble between 1994 and 2022, we detected transient ultraviolet-dark ovals with a 48% to 53% frequency of occurrence in the south. We found the southern dark oval to be 4 to 6 times more common than its northern counterpart. The southern feature is an anticyclonic vortex and remains within the auroral oval during most of its lifetime. The oval’s darkness is consistent with a 20 to 50 times increase in haze abundance or an overall upward shift in the stratospheric haze distribution. The anticyclonic vorticity of the dark oval is enhanced relative to its surroundings, which represents a deep extension of the higher-altitude vortices previously reported in the thermosphere and upper stratosphere. The haze enhancement is probably driven by magnetospheric momentum exchange, with enhanced aerosols producing the localized heating detected in previous infrared retrievals.The precise origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain unknown. Multiwavelength observations of nearby FRB sources can provide important insights into the enigmatic FRB phenomenon. Here we present results from a sensitive, broadband X-ray and radio observational campaign of FRB 20200120E, the closest known extragalactic repeating FRB source (located 3.63 Mpc away in an ~10-Gyr-old globular cluster). We place deep limits on the persistent and prompt X-ray emission from FRB 20200120E, which we use to constrain possible origins for the source. We compare our results with various classes of X-ray sources, transients and FRB models. We find that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be associated with ultraluminous X-ray bursts, magnetar-like giant flares or an SGR 1935+2154-like intermediate flare. Although other types of bright magnetar-like intermediate flares and short X-ray bursts would have been detectable from FRB 20200120E during our observations, we cannot entirely rule them out as a class. We show that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be powered by an ultraluminous X-ray source or a young extragalactic pulsar embedded in a Crab-like nebula. We also provide new constraints on the compatibility of FRB 20200120E with accretion-based FRB models involving X-ray binaries. These results highlight the power of multiwavelength observations of nearby FRBs for discriminating between FRB models.We investigate the Chern–Simons-like formulation of exotic general massive gravity models within the framework of third-way to three-dimensional gravity. We classify our construction into two main approaches: one using torsional cosmological Einstein and exotic massive gravity equations, and the other a torsion-free approach. The former approach, while mathematically appealing, precludes the construction of critical exotic models where the central charges vanish. In contrast, the latter approach has a wider parameter space and allows for the construction of critical models. An explicit example of an exotic general model is provided to illustrate both methods. Our methodology represents the first step towards establishing the most general Chern–Simons-like formulation of third-way to three-dimensional gravity, which would enable the study of identifying its bulk/boundary unitary sector.In this paper, we continue previous work where one-brane spacetimes coupled to the\({\mathcal {N}}=2\)ungauged five dimensional hypermultiplets were found. We explore their symmetries as well as study their full geodesic structure. The one-branes are characterized by a coupling constant that distinguishes the behavior of the geodesics from smooth and causally connected in the positive case to singular and repulsive in the negative case.In an extension of MSSM with two triplets and a singlet, called the TNMSSM, there are seven neutralinos which can enrich the study of cold dark matter if one expects that the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is responsible for the observation of Planck satellite. Such a model, compared to the MSSM, can naturally offer a solution to the\(\mu \)problem, and its lightest neutralino, which is bino-like, can also provide a correct relic density by using the coannihilation mechanism due to the newly added triplinos. Taking into account the related experimental measurements, such as the bound on the SM-like Higgs mass, theBmeson rare decays, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon\(a_\mu \), the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measurements and the latest dark matter direct detection experiment LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), the TNMSSM parameter space can be strictly limited. In respect to all the constraints mentioned above, we find that a bino-like neutralino with a mass in the region\([100, 450]~\textrm{GeV}\)can successfully account for the correct dark matter relic density. Additionally, most of the viable parameter space can be tested in the near future experiments such as the Xenon-nT experiment or LHC.We investigate Color Flavor Locked (CFL) Strange Stars using the most basic de Rham–Gabadadze–Tolley massive gravity model, which explains the massive graviton in the absence of a ghost propagating mode. In the current study, the compact star model has been achieved by solving the field equations for a static, uncharged sphere (Li et al., in Phys Dark Universe 42: 101308, 2023). Here, we provide some analytical and numerical findings and examine the effects of the massive gravity and anisotropy characteristics on the structure of this stellar object. The modified Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation is obtained by taking into account the hydrostatic equilibrium. In order to verify stability of the stellar object, we have taken into account the redshift function and adibatic index. Furthermore, it is observed that the model parameters have a substantial impact on the mass, radius, and compactness of the star object. Finally, our findings provide a possible structure of hypothetical super massive CFL strange stars, which may be placed in the lower “mass-gap” region\(2~M_{\odot }-5~M_{\odot }\)and remains stable without collapsing into a black hole corresponding to our considered model parameters.We study the implications of the observed excess in\(B^+ \rightarrow K^+ \nu \bar{\nu }\)under the assumption of Rank-One Flavour Violation, i.e. that New Physics couples to a single specific direction in flavour space. By varying this direction we perform analyses at the level of the low-energy EFT, the SMEFT, and with explicit mediators such as leptoquarks and colorless vectors (\(Z^\prime \)and\(V^\prime \)). We study correlations with other flavour, electroweak and collider observables, finding that the most interesting ones are with\(K \rightarrow \pi \nu \bar{\nu }\),\(B_s \rightarrow \mu ^+ \mu ^-\), meson mixing and the LHC searches in\(\tau ^+ \tau ^-\)high-energy tails. Among the various mediators, the scalar leptoquarks\(\tilde{R}_2\)and\(S_1\)offer the best fits of the Belle-II excess, while being consistent with the other bounds. On the other hand, colorless vectors are strongly constrained by meson mixing and resonance searches in\(p p \rightarrow \tau ^+ \tau ^-\). In all cases we find that a flavour alignment close to the third generation is generically preferred.We study solutions of Einstein equations with negative cosmological constant in five dimensions that describe black holes whose event horizons are homogeneous, anisotropic spaces. We focus on the case where the constant-time slices of the horizon are the Nil geometry, the Thurston geometry associated to the Heisenberg group. For such spaces, we analyze the symmetries both in the asymptotic region and in the near horizon region. We compute the associated conserved charges, which turn out to be finite and admit a sensible physical interpretation. We analyze the thermodynamics of the Nil black hole, and we present a stationary spinning generalization of it in the slowly rotating approximation.The most recent searches by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in final states with soft leptons and missing transverse energy show mild excesses predominantly associated with dilepton invariant masses of about\(10{-}20\)GeV, which can result from decays of electroweakinos that are heavier than the lightest neutralino by\(\mathcal {O}(10)\)GeV. On the other hand, these analyses are insensitive to electroweakino mass splittings smaller than about 5 GeV. In previous work, we demonstrated that while recent searches in the monojet channel can exclude some of the smallest\(\mathcal {O}(1)\)GeV mass splitting configurations for electroweakinos, they also exhibit excesses that can overlap with the soft-lepton excesses in certain models, including a simplified scenario with pure higgsinos. In this work we dive deeper into these excesses, studying the analyses in detail and exploring an array of models that go beyond the simplified scenarios considered by the experimental collaborations. We show that, in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, the overlapping excesses are not unique to the pure-higgsino limit, instead persisting in realistic parameter space featuring a bino-like lightest supersymmetric particle with some wino admixture. On the other hand, for the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with a singlino-like lightest supersymmetric particle and higgsino-like next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle(s), the excess in the two-lepton channel fits rather well with the parameter space predicting the correct relic abundance through freeze out, but the monojet fit is much poorer. Interestingly, the excesses either do not overlap or do not exist at all for two non-supersymmetric models seemingly capable of producing the correct final states.We perform a theoretical study on the spectrum of the low-lying hidden-bottom (\(q\bar{q}b\bar{b}\)with\(q=\)u,dands) and double-bottom (\(q\bar{q}bb\)) tetraquark states within a nonrelativistic quark model, in which the instanton-induced interaction is taken as the residual spin-dependent hyperfine interaction between quarks. All the model parameters are fixed by fitting the spectrum of the ground hadron states. The numerical results indicate that masses of several\(X_{q\bar{q}}\),\(Z_{b}\), and\(Z_{bs}\)tetraquark states are below and near thresholds of corresponding meson-meson channels, thus these states may form components of exotic meson states with reasonable probabilities. Especially, in present model, masses of several obtained states with quantum number\(I^G(J^P)=1^+(1^{+})\)are close to\(Z_b^\pm (10610)\), so one may expect these states to be non-negligible components of the experimentally observed\(Z_{b}\)states. Concerning to the double-bottom tetraquark states, the present results are in general consistent with other previous works. Two possible stable\(T_{bb}\)states with quark content\(bb\bar{n}\bar{n}\)(\(n=u\)ordquark) lying at energies 10558 MeV and 10650 MeV are found, and one possible stable\(bb\bar{n}\bar{s}\)state is found, whose energy is\(\sim 10687\)MeV.In this work, we explore a Schwarzschild-like black hole within the framework of metric-affine bumblebee gravity. First, we investigate the behavior of the Kretschmann scalar and singularities in this modified gravity approach. Next, we introduce a newly defined time coordinate related to a stationary asymptotically flat spacetime. We also analyze the scattering effects and numerically calculate and comprehensively examine the partial and total absorption cross sections. At the high-frequency approximation, we find that the absorption cross section tends to the geodesic capture cross section. The continued fraction method is applied to investigate the quasinormal modes, and we explore the deviations of both the real and imaginary terms of the quasinormal modes from the Schwarzschild case in detail. We verify the relation between the shadow radius and the real part of the quasinormal frequencies at the eikonal limit within this modified gravity framework. Finally, we examine the energy emission rate.We study the QCD topology and axion properties at finite temperature and chemical potential in the framework of the two-flavor Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model. We find that the behaviors of the two lowest cumulants of the QCD topological charge distribution and axion properties are highly sensitive to the critical behavior of the chiral phase transition. In particular, the topological susceptibility and the axion mass follow the response of the chiral condensate to temperature and chemical potential, showing that both quantities decrease monotonically with the increment of temperature and/or chemical potential. However, it is important to note that the normalized fourth cumulant behaves differently depending on the temperature. At low temperatures, it is a non-monotonic function of the chemical potential, while at high temperatures, it monotonically decreases. Additionally, its value invariably approaches the asymptotic value of\(b_2^{\text {inst}}=-1/12\), predicted by the dilute instanton gas model. We also observe that with the increase in chemical potential at relatively low temperatures, the axion self-coupling constant exhibits a sharp peak around the critical point, which can even be more than twice its vacuum value. After that, the self-coupling drops sharply to a much lower value than its vacuum value, eventually approaching zero in the high chemical potential limit. The finding that the axion self-coupling constant is significantly enhanced in high-density environments near the chiral phase transition could lead to the creation or enhancement of an axion Bose–Einstein condensate in compact astrophysical objects.Vigneron (Found Phys 54:15,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10701-023-00749-z, 2024) recently proposed a modification of general relativity in which a non-dynamical term related to the spatial topology is introduced in the Einstein equation. The original motivation for this theory is to allow for the non-relativistic limit to exist in any physical topology. In the present paper, we derive a first inhomogeneous exact vacuum solution of this theory for a spherical topology, assuming staticity and spherical symmetry. The metric represents a black hole and a repulsive singularity at opposite poles of a 3-sphere. The solution is similar to the Schwarzschild metric, but the spacelike infinity is cut, and replaced by a repulsive singularity at finite distance, implying that the spacelike hypersurfaces have finite volume, and the total mass is zero. We discuss how this solution paves the way to massive, non-static solutions of this theory, more directly relevant for cosmology.The ionization energy loss distributions (spectra) of high-energy protons in oriented silicon crystals are considered on the basis of computer simulation. Evolution of the spectra with the change of the angle\(\theta \)between the particle momentum and the crystal (110) plane is investigated. It is shown that both the most probable and the average energy loss change non-monotonically with the increase of\(\theta \). While at small\(\theta \)these losses are lower than their values in a disoriented crystal, at larger\(\theta \)they can be higher than these values. The dependence of the most probable energy loss on\(\theta \)contains a discontinuity, which however might be challenging to register experimentally. Additionally, the influence of dechanneling and the incident beam divergence on the spectra of planar channeled protons is demonstrated.The localSL(2N,C) symmetry is shown to provide, when appropriately constrained, a viable framework for a consistent unification of the known elementary forces, including gravity. Such a covariant constraint implies that an actual gauge field multiplet in theSL(2N,C) theory is ultimately determined by the associated tetrad fields which not only specify the geometric features of spacetime but also govern which local internal symmetries are permissible within it. As a consequence, upon the covariant removal of all “redundant” gauge field components, the entire theory only exhibits the effective\(SL(2,C)\times SU(N)\)symmetry, comprisingSL(2,C) gauge gravity on one hand andSU(N) grand unified theory on the other. Given that all states involved in theSL(2N,C) theories are additionally classified according to their spin values, many potentialSU(N) GUTs, including the conventionalSU(5) theory, appear to be irrelevant for standard spin 1/2 quarks and leptons. Meanwhile, applying theSL(2N,C) symmetry to the model of composite quarks and leptons with constituent chiral preons in its fundamental representations reveals, under certain natural conditions, that among all accompanying\(SU(N)_{L}\times SU(N)_{R}\)chiral symmetries of preons and their composites only the\(SU(8)_{L}\times SU(8)_{R}\)meets the anomaly matching condition ensuring masslessness of these composites at large distances. This, in turn, identifiesSL(16,C) with the effective\(SL(2,C)\times SU(8)\)symmetry, accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most likely candidate for hyperunification of the existing elementary forces.In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal Kähler potential. Following previous studies that revealed that this model can overcome the\(\eta \)-problem found in F-term models, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties, the energy scales of both inflation and string formation influence the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by these cosmic strings.In this research paper, we focus on analyzing the electromagnetic fields within the framework of a traversable wormhole that incorporates a cosmic string. We then extend our investigation to a traversable wormhole with a global monopole charge, addressing the same problem in this new context. To facilitate our study, we compute the electromagnetic field tensor and derive Maxwell’s vacuum field equations, which govern the behavior of the electric and magnetic fields. Using an analytical approach, we obtain solutions for the electromagnetic fields and compare them with the results from conventional Minkowski flat space. Our study demonstrates significant deviations in the electromagnetic fields, and thus, changes the behavior of electromagnetic waves in the presence of a cosmic string and a global monopole charges within this wormhole background.We construct a new stellar compact object model in the regime of anisotropic pressure using the framework of gravitational decoupling via minimal geometric deformation, with the particularity that the seed solution used is the known Kohler–Chao–Tikekar cosmological solution. As an extra condition to close the Einstein’s field equations resulting for this construction, we use a generalised complexity factor for self-gravitating spheres to the well-known Wyman IIa solution. The resulting model fulfils the fundamental physical acceptability stellar conditions for a compactness factor of a pulsar SMC X-1. The stability of the model is also investigated.Anisotropic hydrodynamics (aHydro) has proven successful in modeling the evolution of quark-gluon matter created in heavy-ion collisions. The hydrodynamic description of quark-gluon plasma has also been widely used to study sound phenomena, such as shock waves. It has recently been shown that initial fluctuations in energy density and supersonic partons can generate fairly strong shock waves. However, significant anisotropic properties of the system due to the rapid longitudinal expansion of matter have not been taken into account in such studies. Moreover, the process of isotropization and its characteristic time-scales were not considered along with the question of the shock waves formation. Previous studies on shock discontinuous solutions in anisotropic hydrodynamics assumed constant anisotropy, leading to flow refraction towards the anisotropy axis and flow acceleration, characteristics of rarefaction waves, indicating limitations in this approach. This paper investigates discontinuous solutions for normal shock waves without flow refraction, introducing two compression parameters for longitudinal and transverse pressures. The resulting analytical solutions, as well as numerical computations, provide an isotropization mechanism of the system.We study zero and finite temperature static Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stars in the combined Rastall-Rainbow (RR) theory of gravity by considering different BEC equation of states (EoSs). We obtain the global properties of BEC stars by solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations of RR gravity with values of Rastall parameter\(\kappa \)and Rainbow function\(\Sigma \)chosen accordingly. We observe that the parameter\(\kappa \)has negligible effect on the maximum mass of the stars considered, whereas\(\Sigma \)alters it significantly, and increasing the value of\(\kappa \)beyond a certain limit results in unstable solutions for any value of\(\Sigma \). We report that the inclusion of temperature in our analysis expands the parameter space by including more values of\(\kappa \). However, temperature has negligible effect on the maximum mass of the stellar profiles in all the three theories. We have also studied the compactness and stability of the obtained stellar equilibria. We report that BEC stars satisfy various energy conditions within the range of\(\kappa \)and\(\Sigma \)taken in our paper.  Further, we find that the maximum masses and radii of the stars within RR theory can have good agreement with the observational data on pulsars for all the EoSs considered and in particular, the Colpi-Wasserman-Shapiro EoS, which was ruled out in General Relativity (GR).  We also find that, in contrast to the results of GR, BEC stars consistent with observations can be realised in the RR theory with smaller bosonic self-interaction strength.Teleparallel description of gravity theories where the gravity is mediated through the tetrad field and consequent torsion provide an alternative route to explain the late time cosmic speed up issue. Generalisation  of the teleparallel gravity theory with different functional forms of the torsion scalarTleads tof(T) gravity. The role of scalar field played in addressing issues in cosmology and astrophysics has developed an interest in the inclusion of a scalar field along with an interaction potential in the action. Such a generalised gravity theory is dubbed as\(f(T,\phi )\)theory. We have explored such a gravity theory to reconstruct the interaction potential of the scalar field required for an extended matter bounce scenario. The cosmological implications of the reconstructed scalar field potential are studied considering two viable and well known functional forms of\(f(T,\phi )\). The energy conditions of these model are discussed to assess the viability of the cosmological models.We introduce a novel Einstein–Rosen BTZ wormhole metric as a solution to the Einstein field equations with a negative cosmological constant and explore in detail its various phenomenological aspects. We show that the wormhole metric is characterized by a horizon at the throat, resembling a black hole horizon. This implies that our wormhole metric describes a one-way traversable wormhole at the throat, with Hawking radiation observed by an observer located at some distance from the wormhole. It is also found the same Hawking temperature using the BTZ-like coordinates and Kruskal-like coordinates. This temperature is invariant not only on the type of coordinates but also the nature of the spin of quantum fields. Importantly, we find that at the wormhole throat, the spacetime is not a pure vacuum solution, but rather contains an exotic string matter source with negative tension, which may stabilize the wormhole geometry. To this end, we found that the size of the wormhole throat is proportional to the number of quantum bits suggesting a possible implications on ER=EPR. Further we studied the particle dynamics and, finally, we tested the ANEC with a test scalar and vector fields. For the double null-component computed in BTZ coordinates, we found an apparent divergence at the wormhole throat, which is then shown to be regularized by means of Kruskal-like coordinates. The ANEC for such a scalar/vector field is violated at the wormhole throat.We present a novel simulation of a strongly interacting dark sector also known as the Hidden Valley scenarios using angular ordered showers and the cluster hadronisation model in Herwig 7. We discuss the basics of this implementation and the scale hierarchies underpinning the simulation. With the help of a few benchmarks, we show the effect of variation of dark sector parameters on thrust and angularities within the dark sector, and study correlation functions, which can be helpful for understanding the angular structure of these events. Finally we comment on the uncertainties introduced due to lack of knowledge of hadronisation parameters within the dark sectors.A shear-free, collapsing compact object, described by an embedding class I solution and emitting radiation, is presented here. Because of the properties of embedding class I, this four-dimensional interior spacetime can be embedded in pseudo-flat five-dimensional space. Starting with an initially static and shear-free gravitating body through the Karmarkar condition, we have explored the time evolution of the system using the time-dependent Einstein field equations. The interior solution is smoothly matched with the Vaidya outgoing solution across a time-like hypersurface which yields the temporal behaviour of the model. Further, a thorough physical analysis of the thermodynamic variables has been presented spatially and temporally. As the time progresses into the future, the surface compactness factor approaches the Buchdahl limit until it crosses this to proceed with the collapse. Before\(2m_\Sigma /r_\Sigma \rightarrow 8/9\), the equation of state adjusts itself like a self-immune system to hold the system by increasing\(\Gamma _{rc}\)(i.e. increasing stiffness). All the physical quantities, e.g., density, pressure anisotropy, radiation, luminosity, temperature, are non-singular throughout the interior of the star at a finite time slice. As the time progresses, these quantities point towards a future singularity. Throughout the evolution, the surface density and surface pressure always remain lower than their corresponding central values. Similarly, the causal temperature also always remains higher than the non-causal counterpart throughout the interior as well as during the evolution.The aim of this paper is to explore the thermodynamic topology of topological charged dilatonic black holes. To achieve this, our study will begin by examining the characteristics of topological charged black holes in dilaton gravity. Specifically, we will concentrate on the impact of the topological constant on the event horizon of these black holes. Subsequently, we will analyze these black holes, considering their thermodynamic and conserved quantities, in order to assess the validity of the first law of thermodynamics. We explore the thermodynamic topology of these black holes by treating them as thermodynamic defects. For our study, we examine two types of thermodynamic ensembles: the fixedqensemble and the fixed\(\phi \)ensemble. To study the impact of the topological constant (k) on thermodynamic topology, we consider all possible types of curvature hypersurfaces that can form in these black holes. By calculating the topological charges at the defects within their thermodynamic spaces, we analyze both the local and global topology of these black holes. We also investigate how the parameters of dilaton gravity affect the thermodynamic topology of black holes and highlight the differences compared to charged black holes in the General Relativity.We consider gedanken experiments to destroy Kerr black holes, by means of absorbing matter with sufficient energy and angular momentum. It is shown that extremal and near-extremal Kerr black holes cannot be destroyed in a process that includes a second order contribution to its final mass, and matter sources satisfy the null energy condition. Such contribution is calculated using hypersurface integration on the event horizon, and it traces similarities with terms related to matter-black hole interactions and a rotational self-energy lower bound suggested in previous works.Abstract—According to data obtained by theUlyssesspacecraft in 2017, high-latitude current sheets have been discovered in the polar heliosphere. They have been observed during solar activity minima in 1994 and 2007 at a distance of 2–3 AU above the south pole of the Sun. The discovered current sheets formed a conical surface rotating as a whole around the Sun’s rotation axis with the Carrington period. In this study, a semianalytical MHD model of conical current sheets is developed. The internal structure of heliospheric region bounded by these sheets—a magnetic funnel with reduced solar wind speed and the plasma beta—has been studied. Solutions corresponding to different intersections of the funnel by theUlyssesspacecraft have been obtained under different conditions near the Sun. The conditions under which the dimensions of the funnel agree with observations are clarified. For the first time, situations are treated in which the plasma and magnetic field parameters inside the funnel vary quasi-periodically in space. The study of the magnetic funnel structure challenges new issues for solar physics, whose solutions will enable a better understanding of the physical conditions on the early Earth and the features of the primary biosphere formation.Abstract—Analysis of meteorites and terrestrial rocks using modern bacterial paleontology methods leads to the conclusion that Life did not originate on Earth, but originated in the form of a protogenome during the formation of the Solar System. Micron and submicron organisms have existed since the origin of the Solar System to the Phanerozoic and into the Phanerozoic on Earth. The study of this organic world can seriously change the understanding of the general development of the living world and the patterns of its evolution, as well as our understanding of the volume of minerals associated with the Precambrian.AbstractComputer modeling has shown that, during the collisional evolution of a solid-state component in gas–dust protoplanetary disks, porous dust clusters of widely ranging sizes are formed. Clusters of this kind have a well-developed internal structure that is topologically similar to the structure of porous catalysts, adsorbents, and carriers used in the organic synthesis technology. On the other hand, observational data currently obtained by such instruments as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) show that complex preorganic compounds rather than only water and volatiles are present in protoplanetary disks. This suggests the possibility that, in protoplanetary disks, there are mechanisms of capturing complex chemical compounds by porous dust clusters and transporting these compounds to warmer regions during migration. When getting to warmer regions of protoplanetary disks, dust clusters undergo a change in the pore space, which may increase the surface holding the captured compounds and, hence, intensify their reactivity.AbstractThe paper summarizes the main provisions of Alexander Spirin’s concept on the possible role of RNA, molecular machines, and molecular colonies in the emergence of life, including (1) the role of the capability of polyribonucleotides of spontaneous rearrangements and recombinations in the generation of RNA molecules and development of their structure, as well as in the early replication of RNA; (2) the principle of operation of molecular machines powered by the energy of Brownian motion and the need for their emergence to solve the problem of unwinding double-stranded molecules formed as a result of the complementary copying of RNA; (3) the role of molecular colonies formed during the replication of RNA in porous media as a mode of compartmentalization and as a prerequisite for the evolution in the precellular RNA world.Abstract—The paper examines two habitable zones with different physical conditions on exoplanets: planets with liquid water on the surface and conditions close to Earth’s (“Goldilocks Zone”), and cold worlds with icy surfaces and subsurface oceans (“Snow Maiden Zone”). The mechanisms of exchange of matter and energy between subglacial oceans and the surrounding space are discussed. It is noted that the biospheres of icy worlds with internal oceans are better protected from unfavorable external cosmic conditions. Subglacial biospheres are weakly dependent on the radiation intensity and flare activity of their parent stars, and the number of planets in the Universe with the physical conditions of the icy Snow Maiden Zone significantly exceeds the number of planets in the very limited Goldilocks Zone. It can be assumed that it is the biospheres of icy oceanic worlds that are much more widespread in the Universe compared to terrestrial-type biospheres.This research delves into the potential existence of traversable wormholes (WHs) within the framework of modified, curvature based gravity. The modification includes linear perturbations of the matter Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor with specific coupling strengths\(\alpha \)and\(\beta \)and can thus be viewed as a special case of linearf(R,T)-gravity with a variable matter coupling or as the simplest additively separable\(f(R,{\mathcal {L}}_m,T)\)-model. A thorough examination of static WH solutions is undertaken using a constant redshift function; therefore, our work can be regarded as the first-order approximation of WH theories in\(f(R,{\mathcal {L}}_m,T)\). The analysis involves deriving WH shape functions based on non-commutative geometry, with a particular focus on Gaussian and Lorentzian matter distributions\(\rho \). Constraints on the coupling parameters are developed so that the shape function satisfies both the flaring-out and asymptotic flatness conditions. Moreover, for positive coupling parameters, violating the null energy condition (NEC) at the WH throat\(r_0\)demands the presence of exotic matter. For negative couplings, however, we find that exotic matter can be avoided by establishing the upper bound\(\beta +\alpha /2<-\frac{1}{\rho r_0^2}-8\pi \). Additionally, the effects of gravitational lensing are explored, revealing the repulsive force of our modified gravity for large negative couplings. Lastly, the stability of the derived WH solutions is verified using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) formalism.AbstractThe study of microorganism tolerance to extreme influences is an integral part of astrobiology. Despite the large number of works in this field, the limits of maintaining viability and activity remain uncertain, and they are probably much wider than the currently known boundaries, especially taking into account the adaptive capabilities of microorganisms. In the vast majority of astrobiological experiments, a very limited set of organisms and the impact of a small number of factors are studied. It seems natural that research gradually develops from modeling simple systems (pure cultures and single-factor impacts) to more complex ones, closer to hypothetical extraterrestrial ecosystems. Nevertheless, studies of the most complex systems (microbial communities under the complex action of extraterrestrial conditions in laboratory and space experiments) are still extremely few in number. At the same time, some features of multifactor impacts and the response of complex microbial systems to such impacts are often given little attention. This paper attempts to summarize some data on the tolerance of microorganisms to extreme factors of extraterrestrial space, as well as to outline a number of insufficiently studied promising fields of astrobiological research.Abstract—The Drake formula or equation represents the best known way of introducing the question of the distribution of life and intelligence in the Universe into the framework of quantitative science. A generalization of the Drake equation is presented in the form of a partial differential equation that includes the effects of the transfer of life elements from one exoplanetary system to another. Possible implications of this equation for assessing the prospects for detecting life beyond Earth are discussed.We formulate a new class of modified gravity models, that is, generalized four-dimensional Chern–Pontryagin models, whose action is characterized by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalarRand the Chern–Pontryagin topological term\( ^*RR\), i.e.,\(f(R, ^*RR)\). Within this framework, we derive the gravitational field equations and solve them for the particular models,\(f(R, ^*RR)=R+\beta ( ^*RR)^2\)and\(f(R, ^*RR)=R+\alpha R^2+\beta ( ^*RR)^2\), considering two ansatzes: the slowly rotating Schwarzschild metric and first-order perturbations of Gödel-type metrics. For the former, we find a first-order correction to the frame-dragging effect boosted by the parameterL, which characterizes the departures from general relativity results. For the latter, Gödel-type metrics hold unperturbed, for specific sort of perturbed metric functions. We conclude this paper by displaying that generalized four-dimensional Chern–Pontryagin models admit a scalar-tensor representation, whose explicit form presents two scalar fields:\(\Phi \), a dynamical degree of freedom, while the second,\(\vartheta \), a non-dynamical degree of freedom. In particular, the scalar field\(\vartheta \)emerges coupled with the Chern–Pontryagin topological term\( ^*RR\), i.e.,\(\vartheta ^*RR\), which is nothing more than Chern–Simons term.Abstract—The Russian space project with the automatic lunar station (ALS)Luna-28is designed to deliver samples of lunar polar regolith to Earth. It is known that the regolith in the vicinity of the lunar poles may contain several percent by weight of water ice and other volatile compounds of cosmic origin. A significant portion of the lunar water could have been delivered to the Moon by comets. It is known that cometary water contains organic compounds, some of which have a complex prebiological structure. Similar comets collided with the Earth in the distant past and also delivered organic compounds of cosmic origin to our planet. According to the panspermia hypothesis, such compounds in the Earth’s primordial ocean could have initiated the process of the emergence of initial forms of primitive life. On the Moon, similar cometary organic matter may be preserved in pristine form in polar permafrost. Studying samples of the polar material delivered in theLuna-28ALS return capsule in terrestrial laboratories will allow experimental verification of the presence or absence of extraterrestrial life spores in it.AbstractThe optical properties of the atmosphere limit the capabilities of ground-based astronomy. Taking telescopes beyond the atmosphere has allowed not only to significantly expand the spectral range of observations, but also to achieve great success in measurements in the visible range. In part, this has stimulated the creation of adaptive optical systems for ground-based telescopes. Of particular interest in the study of planets and exoplanets are observations in the IR and submm ranges. The capabilities of ground-based observations in these ranges are expanding, but will always remain limited. Extra-atmospheric astronomy has absolute priority in this. The article provides an overview of extra-atmospheric observatories in the UV, visible and IR ranges. Particular attention is paid to the new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).Abstract—A review of the results on the migration of celestial bodies in the Solar System and in some exoplanetary systems is presented. Some problems of planet accumulation and migration of planetesimals, small bodies and dust in the forming and present Solar System are considered. It has been noted that the outer layers of the Earth and Venus could have accumulated similar planetesimals from different areas of the feeding zone of the terrestrial planets. In addition to the theory of coaccretion and the mega-impact and multi-impact models, the formation of the embryos of the Earth and the Moon from a common rarefied condensation with subsequent growth of the main mass of the embryo of the Moon near the Earth is also discussed. Along with the Nice model and the “grand tack” model, a model is considered in which the embryos of Uranus and Neptune increased the semimajor axes of their orbits from values of no more than 10 AU to present values only due to gravitational interactions with planetesimals (without the motions of Jupiter and Saturn entering into resonance). The influence of changes in the semimajor axis of Jupiter’s orbit on the formation of the asteroid belt is discussed, as well as the influence of planetesimals from the feeding zone of the giant planets on the formation of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. The migration of bodies to the terrestrial planets from different distances from the Sun is considered. It is noted that bodies from the feeding zone of the giant planets and from the outer asteroid belt could deliver to the Earth a quantity of water comparable to the mass of water in the Earth’s oceans. The migration of bodies ejected from the Earth is considered. It is noted that about 20% of the ejected bodies that left the Earth’s sphere of influence eventually fell back to the Earth. The probabilities of collisions of dust particles with the Earth are usually an order of magnitude greater than the probabilities of collisions of their parent bodies with the Earth. The migration of planetesimals is considered in exoplanetary systems Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST-1. The amount of water delivered to the inner planet Proxima Centauri b, may have been more than the amount delivered to the Earth. The outer layers of neighboring planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system may contain similar material if there were many planetesimals near their orbits during the late stages of planetary accumulation.Abstract—The article is devoted to the significantly underestimated contribution of radiation from the young Sun to the formation of physical conditions on the early Earth. A new view on the faint young Sun paradox is presented: the main role in solving the paradox is given to the impact of the increased activity of the young Sun on the Earth’s atmosphere. The role of planetary organic films is considered as a climate-forming factor involved in resolving the faint young Sun paradox. The spectrum of radiation of the young Sun and the paradox of the discrepancy between the chlorophyll absorption spectrum and the spectrum of solar radiation are discussed, and also indicated a possible connection between the faint young Sun paradox and the origin and evolution of photosynthesis on Earth.AbstractThis paper gives a review of the latest observational data on early stellar nucleosynthesis in the Universe compiled on the basis of an invited report at the “Astronomical Problems of the Origin and Development of Life. The Young Sun and the Earth” meeting-discussion dedicated to the memory of Academician M.Ya. Marov, March 19, 2024. The article presents modern observational results and theoretical ideas about the origin of chemical elements such as carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, which are important for the synthesis of organic matter.Abstract—The concept of the origin of life outside the Earth is currently one of the dominant directions of theoretical, experimental and observational scientific research. The problem of the origin of life is interdisciplinary and includes the most pressing issues of astronomy, biology, paleontology, organic chemistry and other sciences. This issue of the journal is devoted to the astronomical aspects of the origin and development of life.In this paper, we use the solution phase space approach based on the covariant phase space formalism to compute the conserved charges of the BTZ black hole, namely mass, angular momentum, and entropy. Furthermore, we discuss the first law of the BTZ black hole and the Smarr relation. For completeness, outer horizon and inner horizon cases have been all included. Additionally, the results of the three-dimensional Kerr-dS spacetime have also been obtained. Our results are consistent with previous investigations. Considering the simplicity of the circumstances, we have presented the most detailed possible information, with the aim of facilitating rsearch in related fields.In current studies for testing Bell inequalities at colliders, the reconstruction of spin correlations from scattering cross-sections relies on the bilinear form of the spin correlations, but not all local hidden variable models (LHVMs) have such a property. To demonstrate that a general LHVM cannot be rule out via scattering cross-section data, we propose a specific LHVM, which can exactly duplicate the same scattering cross-section for particle production and decay as the standard quantum theory, making it indistinguishable at colliders in principle. Despite of this, we find that reconstructing spin correlations through scattering cross-sections can still exclude a broad class of LHVMs, e.g., those models employing classical spin correlations as a surrogate for quantum spin correlations.Matching conditions are universal ingredients that describe how fragmentation functions change when heavy-flavour thresholds are crossed during the factorisation scale evolution. They are the last missing piece for a consistent description of observables with identified final-state hadrons at next-to-next-to leading order accuracy in quantum chromodynamics. We present an analytical form of the matching condition for light-flavour to hadron fragmentation function at next-to-next-to leading order. The derivation is performed by extending the formalism employed in the extraction of the next-to leading order matching conditions to the subsequent order, making use of\(e^+e^-\)annihilation cross sections. We obtain the first non-trivial heavy-quark effect in the light-quark fragmentation functions and provide results in Mellin space.Recently, J. Harada proposed a theory relating gravity to the Cotton tensor, dubbed as “Cotton gravity” (CG). This is an extension of General Relativity such that every solution of the latter turns out to be a solution of the former (but the converse is not true) and, furthermore, it is possible to derive the cosmological constant as an integration constant within it. In this work we investigate CG by coupling it to both non-linear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields. We study static and spherically symmetric solutions implementing a bouncing behaviour in the radial function so as to avoid the development of singularities, inspired by the Simpson–Visser black bounce and the Bardeen model, both interpreted as magnetic monopoles. We identify the NLED Lagrangian density and the scalar field potential generating such solutions, and investigate the corresponding gravitational configurations in terms of horizons, behaviour of the metric functions, and regularity of the Kretchsman curvature scalar. Our analysis extends the class of non-singular geometries found in the literature and paves the ground for further analysis of black holes in CG.Matching conditions are universal ingredients that describe how fragmentation functions change when heavy-flavour thresholds are crossed during the factorisation scale evolution. They are the last missing piece for a consistent description of observables with identified final-state hadrons at next-to-next-to leading order accuracy in quantum chromodynamics. We present an analytical form of the matching condition for light-flavour to hadron fragmentation function at next-to-next-to leading order. The derivation is performed by extending the formalism employed in the extraction of the next-to leading order matching conditions to the subsequent order, making use of\(e^+e^-\)annihilation cross sections. We obtain the first non-trivial heavy-quark effect in the light-quark fragmentation functions and provide results in Mellin space.We study the hot medium effects in high-multiplicity proton–proton (pp) collisions at\(\sqrt{s_{NN}}=13\)TeV via the charmonium probes. The hot medium is described with the hydrodynamic model, while charmonium evolutions in the medium are studied with a time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The hot medium dissociation on charmonium is considered with the temperature-dependent complex potential parametrized with the results from lattice QCD calculations. The ratio\(\sigma _{\psi (2S)}/\sigma _{J/\psi }\)of\(J/\psi \)and\(\psi (2S)\)production cross sections are calculated and compared with the LHCb experimental data in pp collisions. Our calculations explain the charmonium relative suppression in different transverse momentum and multiplicity bins. The suppression of this ratio is mainly affected by the effects of the deconfined medium. It is less affected by the initial effects before the generation of the heavy quark pair. We suggest this to be a clear signal of the small QGP droplets generated in high multiplicity pp collisions.We consider the non-commutative (NC) Kerr black hole where the mass of the central object is smeared over a region of linear size\(\sqrt{b}\),bis the strength of the NC character of spacetime. For the spacetime under consideration, we calculate the amplification factor for electromagnetic and gravitational fields and study various properties of a thin accretion disk. The expression for the amplification factor is obtained with the help of the asymptotic matching technique. The amplification factor is then plotted against frequency for various values of the spinaand the NC parameterb. Though the amplification factor increases withabut decreases withb, the cut-off frequency up to which we have amplification increases withaandb. We then study the effect of the spin and the NC nature of spacetime on the energy flux, temperature distribution, emission spectrum, energy conversion efficiency, and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit of a thin accretion disk around the black hole with the help of the steady-state Novikov–Thorne model. Our study reveals that these quantities increase with the spin and the NC parameter. We also find that the disk around the NC Kerr black is hotter and more luminous than that around the Kerr black hole and the NC Schwarzschild black hole. We can conclusively infer from our investigation that the NC nature of spacetime has a significant impact on the superradiance phenomenon as well as on various properties of thin accretion disks.The focus of this work is centered on determining whether traversable wormholes admitting Einasto density profile exist within the framework off(R,T) gravity. Using the Morris–Thorne spacetime, we express the wormhole configuration and formulate the anisotropic gravitational equations for a particular linear modified model. Afterwards, by considering two different (constant and variable) redshift functions, we derive the shape function for wormholes and examine its potential stability. The developed functions conform to the necessary conditions and form a connection between two spacetime regions that are asymptotically flat. We also examine the viability of resulting wormhole solutions by verifying their violation with the null energy conditions. We also investigate the active gravitational mass and the complexity factor for our solutions. The later quantity is found to be negative near the wormhole throat and becomes zero when moving away from this point. Further, various methods of stability analysis are utilized to assess the developed models. Our results suggest that the constructed wormhole geometries meet the necessary conditions, thereby existing within the considered modified gravity.In this work we study the thermodynamics formulation for unimodular gravity under the election of two different models for the energy diffusion function. Such function encodes the current for the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor and is usually termed asQ(t). In analogy to the cosmological scenario where the cosmic expansion is influenced byQ(t), the thermodynamics implications in this scheme are also determined by the choice of the functionQ(t), as we discuss in the work. Specifically, we consider the barotropic and the continuous spontaneous localization models as energy diffusion functions, commonly used in the literature as viable candidates to face the well-known\(H_{0}\)tension. The consistency conditions demanded for the entropy of the system in terms of the cosmological parameters of the model: positive production (\(dS/dt>0\)) and convexity condition (\(d^{2}S/dt^{2} <0\)), are investigated. We show that these conditions strongly constraint the viability of both models. Additionally, we comment about our results and compare with those obtained in recent works where the restriction of the parameters for these two diffusion models was implemented with the use of cosmological data.Jupiter’s oxygen content is inextricably tied to its formation history and the evolution of the early Solar System. Recent one-dimensional thermochemical modelling of CO showed that the planet’s bulk water content could be subsolar, in stark contrast to the water enrichment determined near the equator using the Juno spacecraft. Here we use a hydrodynamic model to study Jupiter’s atmospheric dynamics at and below the water cloud level with simplified thermochemistry to show the effect of hydrodynamics on the abundance of disequilibrium species CO, PH3and GeH4in the troposphere. If PH3and GeH4provide only an upper limit for the oxygen abundance (≤5 times solar), our results suggest an oxygen enrichment range of 2.5–5 times solar using updated CO thermochemistry. Using the conventional CO chemical timescale, we further reveal a correlation between moist convection and the CO abundance at the water cloud level. If such a correlation is found observationally, it would favour the formation of Jupiter near the snow line, which harbours a supersolar oxygen abundance.The paper studies the possible interplay between matter and geometry in scalar tensor theories of gravitation where the energy–momentum tensor is directly coupled with the Einstein tensor. After obtaining the scalar tensor representation of the\(f(R, G_{\mu \nu }T^{\mu \nu })\)gravity, the analysis continue with an approach based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes in open systems. To this regard, various thermodynamic properties are directly obtained in this manner, like the matter creation (annihilation) rate and the corresponding creation (annihilation) pressure. In the case of the Roberson–Walker metric several analytic and numerical solutions are found in the asymptotic regime. In the last part of the manuscript a specific parametrization for the Hubble rate is constrained using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms in the case of cosmic chronometers (CC) and BAO observations, obtaining an approximate numerical solution which can describe the cosmological model. For this model, we have obtained by fine-tuning some numerical solutions which exhibit creation mechanisms in different specific regimes.The Monumentexperiment measures ordinary muon capture (OMC) on isotopes relevant for neutrinoless double-beta (\(0\nu \beta \beta \)) decay and nuclear astrophysics. OMC is a particularly attractive tool for improving the theoretical description of\(0\nu \beta \beta \)decay. It involves similar momentum transfers and allows testing the virtual transitions involved in\(0\nu \beta \beta \)decay against experimental data. During the 2021 campaign, Monumentstudied OMC on\(^{76}\)Se and\(^{136}\)Ba, the isotopes relevant for next-generation\(0\nu \beta \beta \)decay searches, like Legendand nEXO. The experimental setup has been designed to accurately extract the total and partial muon capture rates, which requires precise reconstruction of energies and time-dependent intensities of the OMC-related\(\gamma \)rays. The setup also includes a veto counter system to allow selecting a clean sample of OMC events. This work provides a detailed description of the Monumentsetup operated during the 2021 campaign, its two DAQ systems, calibration and analysis approaches, and summarises the achieved detector performance. Future improvements are also discussed.In this paper, our aim is to extend our earlier work [Ahmed et al. in Eur. Phys. J. C 76:280, 2016], investigating an axisymmetric plasma flow with angular momentum onto a spherical black hole. To accomplish that goal, we focus on the case in which the ideal magnetohydrodynamic approximation is valid, utilizing certain conservation laws which arise from particular symmetries of the system. After formulating a Hamiltonian of the physical system, we solve the Hamilton equations and look for critical solutions of (both in and out) flows. Reflecting the difference from the Schwarzschild spacetime, the positions of sonic points (fast magnetosonic point, slow magnetosonic point, Alfvén point) are altered. We explore several kinds of flows including critical, non-critical, global, magnetically arrested and shock induced. Lastly, we analyze the shock states near a specific quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole and determine that quantum effects do not favor shock states by pushing the shock location outward.We investigate electrical charge transport in hot magnetized plasma using first-principles quantum field theoretical methods. By employing Kubo’s linear response theory, we express the electrical conductivity tensor in terms of the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation. Utilizing leading-order results for the damping rates from a recent study within a gauge theory, we derive the transverse and longitudinal conductivities for a strongly magnetized plasma. The analytical expressions reveal drastically different mechanisms that explain the high anisotropy of charge transport in a magnetized plasma. Specifically, the transverse conductivity is suppressed, while the longitudinal conductivity is enhanced by a strong magnetic field. As in the case of zero magnetic field, longitudinal conduction is determined by the probability of charge carriers to remain in their quantum states without damping. In contrast, transverse conduction critically relies on quantum transitions between Landau levels, effectively lifting charge trapping in localized Landau orbits. We examine the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the transverse and longitudinal electrical conductivities over a wide range of parameters and investigate the effects of a nonzero chemical potential. Additionally, we extend our analysis to strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma and study the impact of the coupling constant on the anisotropy of electrical charge transport.According to the quantum deformation approach to quantum gravity, the thermodynamical entropy of a quantum-deformed (q-deformed) black hole with horizon areaAestablished by Jalalzadeh is expressed as\(S = \pi \sin \left( \frac{A}{8G\mathcal {N}} \right) /\sin \left( \frac{\pi }{2\mathcal {N}}\right) \), where\(\mathcal {N}=L_q^2/L_{p}^2\)is the q-deformation parameter,\(L_{p}\)denotes the Planck length, and\(L_q\)denotes the quantum-deformed cosmic apparent horizon distance. In this paper, assuming that the q-deformed entropy is associated with the apparent horizon of the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) universe, we derive the modified Friedmann equation from the unified first law of thermodynamics,\( dE = TdS + WdV \). And this one obtained is in line with the modified Friedmann equation derived from the law of emergence proposed by Padmanabhan. It clearly shows the connection between the law of emergence and thermodynamics. We further investigate the constraints of entropy maximization in the framework of the q-deformed horizon entropy, and the results demonstrate the consistency of the law of emergence with the maximization of the q-deformed horizon entropy.In this paper, we study black hole solutions in double field theory. In the first part, we introduce a solution-generating method and classify black hole solutions into three categories in standard double field theory. To solve the problem of double time, we utilize space/time split double field theory in the second part to derive black hole solutions. By introducing a cosmological constant and imposing the strong constraint, our findings indicate that when considering the entire doubled spacetime, the curvature signifies a generalized AdS vacuum. However, in the subspace of the entire spacetime, black holes and curvature singularities emerge.We report the performance of a magnetically silent optically pumped cesium magnetometer with a statistical sensitivity of 3.5 pT/\(\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}\)at 1 Hz and a stability of 90 fT over 150 s of measurement. Optical pumping with coherent, linearly-polarized, resonant light leads to a relatively long-lived polarized ground state of the cesium vapour contained in a measurement cell. The state precesses at its Larmor frequency in the magnetic field to be measured. Nonlinear magneto-optical rotation then leads to the rotation of the plane of polarization of a linearly polarized probe laser beam. The rotation angle is modulated at twice the Larmor frequency. A measurement of this frequency constitutes an absolute measurement of the magnetic field magnitude. Featuring purely optical operation, non-magnetic construction, low noise floor, and high stability, this sensor will be used for the upcoming TUCAN electric dipole moment experiment and other highly sensitive magnetic applications. Novel aspects of the system include commercial construction and the ability to operate up to 24 sensors on a single probe laser diode.In a simplified model including an exotic vector-likeX-quark (VLQ-X) with electric charge 5/3, we investigate the process\(e^{+}p \rightarrow \bar{\nu }_{e}X+\bar{\nu }_{e}X\bar{t}\)induced by the couplings between the VLQ-Xand the first- and third-generation quarks at the futureepcolliders. We further explore the prospects of discovering the VLQ-Xvia the\(X\rightarrow tW\)decay model at the electron–hadron Future Circular Collider (FCC-eh) with its proposed 60 GeV electron beam and 50 TeV proton beam. We focus our analysis on the final states, including two same-sign lepton (electrons or muons) or\(\mu \mu \)pairs, at least oneb-tagged jet, and large missing transverse momentum. By performing a detailed signal-to-background analysis and detector simulations, the 95% confidence level exclusion limits and\(5\sigma \)discovery reaches are presented in terms of parameter space regions.We revisit planar vortex solutions within a model derived from the dimensional reduction of scalar electromagnetism, with a quartic potential incorporating the Carroll–Field–Jackiw term. We explore analytically and numerically the influence of a Lorentz symmetry-breaking constant field on these configurations and our analysis shows how this constant field can produce a new asymptotic behaviour characterised by damped oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields on the edge of the vortices.The null energy condition (NEC) is a fundamental principle in general relativity, and its violation could leave discernible signatures in gravitational waves (GWs). A violation of the NEC during the primordial era would imprint a blue-tilted spectrum on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nanohertz frequencies, potentially accounting for the recently detected signal by pulsar timing arrays. Remarkably, models of NEC violation during inflation also predict a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum in the millihertz frequency range, which could be detectable by upcoming space-based GW detectors such as Taiji. The observation of this distinctive spectrum would provide compelling evidence for new physics beyond the standard cosmological paradigm. In this study, we explore Taiji’s ability to detect an SGWB arising from NEC violation during inflation, considering various foregrounds and noise sources, including an extragalactic foreground from binary black hole mergers throughout the Universe, a galactic foreground from white dwarf binaries, and the intrinsic noise of the Taiji detector. Employing comprehensive Bayesian parameter estimation techniques to analyze simulated Taiji data, we demonstrate a remarkable improvement in precision of three orders of magnitude compared to the NANOGrav 15-year data set for measuring the tensor power spectrum amplitude,\(P_{T,2}\), during the second inflationary stage. This substantial enhancement in measurement capabilities underscores Taiji’s potential as a powerful probe for investigating the NEC violation in the early Universe.We investigate the radiative efficiency and jet power in the spacetime of a rotating black hole within the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG), which includes an additional LQG parameter. The results show that as the LQG parameter increases, the radiative efficiency decreases for slowly rotating black holes while it increases for rapidly rotating black holes. Furthermore, the jet power is found to increase for different black hole spins. With the observed data from the well-known sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, GRS1124-683, GRO J1655-40, and GRS1915+105, we make some constraints on the black hole spin parameter and the LQG parameter. The presence of the LQG parameter broadens the allowed range of the black hole spin parameter for sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564 and GRO J1655-40. However, for the source GRS 1915+105, there is no overlap between the allowed parameter regions, which implies that the rotating LQG black hole cannot simultaneously account for the observed jet power and the radiative efficiency as in other black hole spacetimesA study of the dynamical and thermodynamical stability of a charged thin-shell wormhole built by gluing two Reissner–Nordström geometries is presented. The charge on the shell is linearly related to the matter content. For the dynamical stability, a concise inequality is obtained, valid for any barotropic equation of state that relates the pressure with the energy density at the throat. A thermodynamical description of the system is introduced, which leads to the temperature and the electric potentials. Adopting a linear equation of state for the pressure and a definite form for the entropy function, the set of equilibrium configurations that are both dynamically and thermodynamically stable is found.Recent measurements of the Lamb shift of muonic helium-4 ions were used to infer the alpha particle charge radius. The value found is compatible with the radius extracted from the analysis of the electron-helium scattering. Thus, the new spectroscopic data put additional empirical bounds on some free parameters of certain physics theories beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we analyze the new data in the context of large extra-dimensional theories. Specifically, we calculate the influence of the radion, the scalar degree of freedom of the higher-dimensional gravity, on the energy difference between the 2S and 2P levels of this exotic atom. The radion field is related to fluctuations of the volume of the supplementary space. It should be treated as a phenomenologically independent quantity in relation to the tensorial degrees of freedom of the metric within the braneworld scenario. Based on the spectroscopic data of muonic helium, we find constraints for the effective energy scale of the radion as a function of the alpha particle radius. Then, we discuss the implications of these new constraints on the proton radius puzzle. We also establish a new empirical bound for the radion by examining its influence on the isotopic shift in the 2P-2S transition of muonic hydrogen and muonic deuteron. In connection with this discussion, we study the impact of the radion on the tension observed in measurements of the difference between the squared radii of the helion and alpha particle as extracted from muonic and electronic helium isotopes.During the cosmic evolution process, as the temperature of a cosmological boson gas falls below a certain threshold, a Bose–Einstein condensation process can occur at various points throughout the cosmic history of the Universe. In this model, dark matter, conceptualized as a non-relativistic, Newtonian gravitational condensate is governed by the Gross–Pitaevskii–Poisson system. In our present study, we investigate the Bose–Einstein condensation process of bosonic DM by treating it as an approximate first-order phase transition within a modified cosmological framework, known as Tsallis cosmology. We examine the evolution of relevant physical quantities characterizing the evolution dynamics of the Universe, including energy density, temperature, redshift, scale factor, Hubble parameter, and dimensionless deceleration parameter before, during, and following the Bose–Einstein condensation phase transition takes place. Additionally, we especially investigate the specific era of the evolution of the Universe characterized by a mixture ofnormaland condensate phases of dark matter. We analyze the behavior of temporal evolution of an important time-dependent parameter, called the condensate dark matter fraction throughout the condensation process and find the time duration of condensation of dark matter in the Tsallis cosmological model. We see that the presence of Bose–Einstein condensate dark matter in the framework of Tsallis-modified cosmology significantly alters the cosmological evolution of the Universe as compared to the standard model of cosmology. We also find for a typical value of Tsallis non-extensive parameter\(\beta =0.35\), the model could explain an accelerated Universe without invoking any additional energy component and solve the age problem of our Universe.A study of the dynamical and thermodynamical stability of a charged thin-shell wormhole built by gluing two Reissner–Nordström geometries is presented. The charge on the shell is linearly related to the matter content. For the dynamical stability, a concise inequality is obtained, valid for any barotropic equation of state that relates the pressure with the energy density at the throat. A thermodynamical description of the system is introduced, which leads to the temperature and the electric potentials. Adopting a linear equation of state for the pressure and a definite form for the entropy function, the set of equilibrium configurations that are both dynamically and thermodynamically stable is found.While searching at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for the production and decay of the CP-odd scalar (\(A^0\)) in the 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) with Natural Flavour Conservation (NFC) via the channels\(gg\rightarrow A^0\)(through one-loop triangle diagrams) and\(A^0\rightarrow h^0 Z^*\)(with\(m_{h^0} =125\)GeV or\(m_{h^0} < 125\)GeV, withZoff-shell), respectively, a factorisation of the two processes is normally performed, with the\(A^0\)state being on-shell. While this approach is gauge-invariant, it is not capturing the presence of either of the following two channels:\(gg\rightarrow Z^*\rightarrow h^0Z^*\)(through one-loop triangle diagrams) or\(gg\rightarrow h^0Z^*\)(through one-loop box diagrams). As the resolution of the\(A^0\)mass cannot be infinitely precise, we affirm that all such contributions should be computed simultaneously, whichever the\(h^0\)(\(Z^{*}\)) decay(splitting) products, thereby including all possible interferences amongst themselves. The cross section of the ensuing complete process is significantly different from that obtained in the factorisation case, being of the order up to ten percent in either direction at the integrated level and larger (including changes in the shape of kinematical observables) at the differential level. We thus suggest that the complete calculation ought to be performed while searching for\(A^0\)in this channel. We illustrate this need for the case of a 2HDM of Type-I in the inverted hierarchy scenario with\(m_{h^0}<125\)GeV.Since the weak cosmic censorship conjecture was proposed, research on this conjecture has been ongoing. This paper explores the conjecture in black holes that are closer to those existing in the real universe (i.e., rotating black holes enveloped by dark matter). In this paper, we obtained a first-order corrected analytical solution for the black hole event horizon through an approximate solution. The validity of the first-order corrected analytical solution will be provided in the appendix. We conduct our study by introducing a test particle and a scalar field into the black hole. Our conclusions show that, in extremal case, both a test particle and a scalar field can disrupt the event horizon of the Kerr-like black hole; in near-extremal case, both a test particle and a scalar field can disrupt the event horizon of the Kerr-like black hole. When cold dark matter is not considered, the conclusion is consistent with previous research.We consider a scenario with axions/axion-like particles Chern–Simons gravity coupling, such that gravitational waves can be produced directly from axion wave parametric resonance in the early universe after inflation. This axion gravity term is less constrained compared to the well-searched axion photon coupling and can provide a direct and efficient production channel for gravitational waves. Such stochastic gravitational waves can be detected by either space/ground-based gravitational wave detectors or pulsar timing arrays for a broad range of axion masses and decay constants.We obtained the metric of the Schwarzschild-like black hole with loop quantum gravity (LQG) corrections in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time, under the assumption that the cosmological constant is decoupled in LQG. We investigated its thermodynamics, including the equation of state, criticality, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy. The\(P-v\)graph was plotted, and the critical behavior was calculated. It was found that, due to the LQG effect, the quantum-corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole exhibits a critical point and a critical ratio of 7/18, which differs from the Reissner–Nordstr\(\ddot{\textrm{o}}\)m-AdS black hole’s ratio of 3/8 (the same as that of the Van der Waals system) slightly. However, there are still some similarities compared to the Van der Waals system, such as the same critical exponents and a similar\(P-v\)graph. Moreover, it is concluded that the energy-momentum tensor related to the black hole’s mass could violate the conventional first law of thermodynamics. This modified first law may violate the conservation of Gibbs free energy during the small black hole-large black hole phase transitions, potentially indicating the occurrence of the zeroth-order phase transition. The Joule–Thomson expansion was also studied. Interestingly, compared to the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, the LQG effect leads to inversion points. The inversion curve divides the\(\left( P,T\right) \)coordinate system into two regions: a heating region and a cooling region, as shown in detail by the inversion curves and isenthalpic curves. The results indicated that there is a minimum inversion mass, below which any black hole will not possess an inversion point.In this paper, we investigate the spacetime containing both small-scale structures (wiggles) and spatial dislocation, forming a wiggly cosmic dislocation. We study the combined effects of these features on the dynamics of massive and massless particles. Our results show that while wiggles alone lead to bound states and dislocation introduces angular momentum corrections, their coupling produces more complex effects, influencing both particle motion and wave propagation. Notably, this coupling significantly modifies radial solutions and eigenvalues, with the direction of motion or propagation becoming a critical factor in determining the outcomes. Numerical solutions reveal detailed aspects of particle dynamics as functions of dislocation and string parameters, including plots of trajectories, probability densities, and energy levels. These findings deepen our understanding of how a wiggly cosmic dislocation shapes particle dynamics, suggesting new directions for theoretical exploration in cosmological models.In this study, we investigate the image of a rotating compact object (CO) illuminated by a geometrically thin, optically thin disk on the equatorial plane. As the radius of the CO’s surface fluctuates, the CO may partially or entirely obscure the photon region. We observe that the perceived photon ring may exhibit discontinuities, deviating from a closed structure, and may even disappear entirely. We find that the disruption and disappearance of the photon ring are dependent on the observational angle-a novel phenomenon not previously observed in black hole imaging studies. Our study reveals that while the factors influencing this unique photon ring phenomenon are diverse and the outcomes complex, we can provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of the physical essence and variation trends of this phenomenon. We do this by introducing and analyzing the properties and interrelationships of three characteristic functions,\(\tilde{\eta }\),\(\eta _o\), and\(\eta _s\)related to the photon impact parameters. Additionally, our analysis of the intensity cuts and inner shadows of the images uncovers patterns that differ significantly from the shadow curve.We show for the first time that rotating wormholes are capable of emitting a Poynting flux in the process of accreting magnetized matter. To this end, we analyze the Damour–Solodukhin metric describing a Kerr-type wormhole and calculate the electromagnetic flux assuming a specific geometry for the magnetic field contained by the wormhole ergosphere. We find that for highly rotating wormholes a mechanism similar to that of Blandford and Znajek is possible, and the emitted electromagnetic flux is of the same order as for a Kerr black hole.We analyze the extraction of the rotational energy of a Kerr black hole (BH) endowed with a test charge and surrounded by an external test magnetic field and ionized low-density matter. For a magnetic field parallel to the BH spin, electrons move outward(inward) and protons inward(outward) in a region around the BH poles(equator). For zero charge, the polar region comprises spherical polar angles\(-60^\circ \lesssim \theta \lesssim 60^\circ \)and the equatorial region\(60^\circ \lesssim \theta \lesssim 120^\circ \). The polar region shrinks for positive charge, and the equatorial region enlarges. For an isotropic particle density, we argue the BH could experience acyclicbehavior: starting from a zero charge, it accretes more polar protons than equatorial electrons, gaining net positive charge, energy and angular momentum. Then, the shrinking(enlarging) of the polar(equatorial) region makes it accrete more equatorial electrons than polar protons, gaining net negative charge, energy, and angular momentum. In this phase, the BH rotational energy is extracted. The extraction process continues until the new enlargement of the polar region reverses the situation, and the cycle repeats. We show that this electrodynamical process produces a relatively limited increase of the BH irreducible mass compared to gravitational mechanisms like the Penrose process, hence being a more efficient and promising mechanism for extracting the BH rotational energy.\(\varLambda \)-Cold Dark Matter (\(\varLambda \)CDM) has been successful at explaining the large-scale structures in the universe but faces severe issues on smaller scales when compared to observations. Introducing self-interactions between dark matter particles claims to provide a solution to the small-scale issues in the\(\varLambda \)CDM simulations while being consistent with the observations at large scales. The existence of the energy region in which these self-interactions between dark matter particles come close to saturating the S-wave unitarity bound can result in the formation of dark matter bound states called darkonium. In this scenario, all the low energy scattering properties are determined by a single parameter, the inverse scattering length\(\gamma \). In this work, we set bounds on\(\gamma \)by studying the impact of darkonium on the observations at direct detection experiments using data from CRESST-III and XENON1T. The exclusion limits on\(\gamma \)are then subsequently converted to exclusion limits on the self-interaction cross-section and compared with the constraints from astrophysics and N-body simulations.The effect of Hawking radiation on tripartite measurement uncertainty in a Schwarzschild black hole background is analyzed in this study. Two scenarios are examined. In the first, quantum memory particles approach a Schwarzschild black hole and are positioned near the event horizon, while the particle being measured remains in the asymptotically flat region. In the second scenario, the measured particle moves toward the black hole, and the quantum memories stay in the asymptotically flat region. This study considers two initial quantum states, namely GHZ and W states. Our findings reveal that in both cases, measurement uncertainty increases steadily with rising Hawking temperature. When comparing the GHZ and W states, the GHZ state initially exhibits lower measurement uncertainty at low Hawking temperatures than the W state, indicating greater resilience to Hawking radiation. Additionally, when the quantum memories remain in the asymptotically flat region while the measured particle falls toward the black hole, the uncertainties for GHZ and W states do not align at high temperatures. The GHZ state consistently demonstrates lower measurement uncertainty, showcasing its superior robustness against Hawking radiation.We perform a detailed phenomenological study of high-energy neutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS) focused on LHC far-forward experiments such as FASER\(\nu \)and SND@LHC. To this aim, we parametrise the neutrino fluxes reaching these LHC far-forward experiments in terms of ‘neutrino PDFs’ encoding their energy and rapidity dependence by means of theLHAPDFframework. We integrate these neutrino PDFs in the recently developedPOWHEG-BOX-RESimplementation of neutrino-induced DIS to produce predictions accurate at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the QCD coupling matched to parton showers (PS) withPythia8. We present NLO+PS predictions for final-state distributions within the acceptance for FASER\(\nu \)and SND@LHC as well as for two experiments of the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF), FASER\(\nu \)2 and FLArE. We quantify the impact of NLO QCD corrections, of the parton showering and hadronisation settings inPythia8, of the QED shower, and of the incoming neutrino flavour for the description of these observables, and compare our predictions with theGENIEneutrino event generator. Our work demonstrates the relevance of modern higher-order event generators to achieve the key scientific targets of the LHC neutrino experiments.This paper investigates the Joule-Thomson expansion for a five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet Anti-de Sitter black hole. Firstly, by taking Van der Waals gas as an example, we induce the definition of the Joule-Thomson coefficient and the inversion phenomena. One can give theT–Pgraph and the inversion curves. Then, we obtain the thermodynamic properties of the Gauss-Bonnet black hole and use the same way to get theT–Pfigure, which shows differences from Van der Waals gas and other black holes. To our surprise, we can’t observe its inversion phenomena. Due to this reason, we further studied the vanished inversion region and found that the electric charge plays an important role in this phenomenon. We analogy black hole charged and neutral, which get some interesting consequences. Finally, we make Legendre transition to Smarr relation and investigate whether the electric potential has the same result as the electric charge’s landscape. These results will uncover the inner interaction between the enthalpy and the electric charge during the Joule-Thomson process.Quantum clock synchronization (QCS) can measure out the high-precision clock difference among distant users, which breaks through the standard quantum limit by employing the properties of quantum entanglement. Currently, the wavelength division multiplexed QCS network has been demonstrated with a spontaneous parametric down-conversion entangled photon source. In this paper, we propose a more efficient QCS network scheme with the wavelength multicasting entangled photon source, which can decrease at least 25% of wavelength channel consumption under the identical network scale. Afterwards, a four node QCS network is demonstrated, where the wavelength multicasting entangled photon source is utilized with dual-pumped four-wave mixing silicon chip. The experimental results show that the measured time deviation is 3.4 ps with an average time of 640 s via the multiple fiber links of more than 10 km.Water activity recorded in asteroids offers a perspective on their habitability. Aqueous alteration, namely the interaction of liquid water with minerals, occurred in the parent body of the C-type asteroid Ryugu. However, Ryugu is not a wet body, and the processes that led to the loss of liquid water along with its chemical environment remain unclear. We report the presence of sodium carbonates, chlorides and sulfates in Ryugu samples, which indicate that alkaline, salt-rich water once flowed through its parent body. Highly concentrated brine probably formed through evaporation or freezing of the liquid water in the final stages of aqueous alteration. Similar processes may have occurred in carbonaceous asteroids in the Solar System, although terrestrial weathering of meteorites might obscure evidence of salt precipitation. Sodium salts could be crucial for comparing the evolved water in carbonaceous bodies and alkaline subsurface oceans in the dwarf planet Ceres and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.Quantum gravity has been baffling the theoretical physicist for decades now, both for its mathematical obscurity and phenomenological testing. Nevertheless, the new era of precision cosmology presents a promising avenue to test the effects of quantum gravity. In this study, we consider a bottom-up approach. Without resorting to any candidate quantum gravity, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) directly into the cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe sourced by a phantom scalar field with potential to study the evolution of the universe in a very early epoch. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our qualitative analysis shows that the introduction of GUP significantly alters the existence of fixed points for the potential considered in this paper. In addition, we confirm the existence of an inflationary phase and analyze the behavior of relevant cosmological parameters with respect to the strength of the GUP distortion.It is proved that charged thin shells (charged Dyson shells) can be supported in unstablestaticequilibrium states around spherically symmetric central compact objects. The regime of existence of the composed central-compact-object-static-charged-shell configurations is characterized by the inequalities\(\sqrt{m(m+2M)}<|q|<M+\sqrt{M^2+m^2}\), where\(\{m,q\}\)are respectively the proper mass and the electric charge of the supported shell andMis the mass of the central compact object (a black hole or an horizonless compact star). We reveal the physically interesting fact that the supported charged shells become marginally-stable in the\(|q|/\sqrt{m(m+2M)}\rightarrow 1^+\)limit, in which case the lifetime (instability timescale) of the composed system can be made arbitrarily large. Our analysis goes beyond the test shell approximation by properly taking into account the exact gravitational and electromagnetic self-interaction energies of the spherically symmetric shell in the curved spacetime. In particular, the existence of the composed compact-object-charged-shell static configurations in the Einstein–Maxwell theory is attributed to the non-linear electromagnetic self-energy of the supported shell.A connection between regular black holes and horizonless ultracompact objects was proposed in Carballo-Rubio et al. (JHEP 08:046, 2023,arXiv:2211.05817[gr-qc]). In this paper, we construct a model of a horizonless compact object, specifically an anisotropic gravastar with continuous pressure, that corresponds to regular black hole spacetime in the appropriate limit. The construction begins by modeling an equation of state that satisfies the anisotropic gravastar conditions and transitions to the de Sitter (\(p=-\epsilon \)) upon horizon formation. The spacetime structure is similar to theQuantum Horizonless Compact Object(QHCO) described in Chen and Yokokura (Phys Rev D 109:104058, 2024,arXiv:2403.09388[gr-qc]). Within this model, we also generate images of the corresponding objects surrounded by a thin accretion disk. The resulting images reveal that assuming that the emitting matter exists only outside the object, the inner light ring structure closely resembles that of the horizonless configuration of a regular black hole and the QHCO, yet it exhibits a distinct light ring structure compared to the thin-shell gravastar model. However, the opposite occurs when emitting matter is taken into account inside the object.This work is devoted to exploring the formation and stability of thin-shell wormholes developed through the two similar copies of black holes bounded by the pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo. It is found that the horizon radius of a black hole decreases in the appearance of a pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo. The primary goal of the work is to investigate the stable composition of such wormholes using the analysis of linearized radial perturbation. It is worth mentioning that the existence of a pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo reduces the violation of energy bounds for the developed thin-shell wormholes. We investigate the impact of variable equations of state, such as barotropic, variable Chaplygin, and phantom-like equations of state, on the stability of the wormholes. The inquiry highlights that the appearance of a pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo portrays remarkable importance in preserving the stable compositions of thin-shell wormholes. The wormholes show maximal stable conduct for the selection of pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo as compared to already published research charged as well as regular thin-shell wormholes. The results reveal light on the interplay between wormholes and pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo, which increases our understanding of both conjectures and their potential implications for further space travel.We apply Wald’s formalism to a Lagrangian within generalised Proca gravity that admits a Schwarzschild black hole with a non-trivial vector field. The resulting entropy differs from that of the same black hole in General Relativity by a logarithmic correction modulated by the only independent charge of the vector field. We find conditions on this charge to guarantee that the entropy is a non-decreasing function of the black hole area, as is the case in GR. If this requirement is extended to black hole mergers, we find that for Planck scale black holes, a non-decreasing entropy is possible only if the area of the final black hole is several times larger than the initial total area of the merger. Finally, we discuss some implications of the vector Galileon entropy from the point of view of entropic gravity.The focus of this paper is to investigate the behavior of a codimension-one thick brane in the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity structure\(f(Q, {\mathcal {T}})\), whereQis the nonmetricity scalar and\({\mathcal {T}}\)is the trace of the energy–momentum tensor. Additionally, we examine whether braneworld scenarios are stable under small tensor perturbations and identify the associated massive and resonant modes. Our results indicate that the parameters controlling the modifications to the gravitational model-specifically those affecting nonmetricity and the energy–momentum tensor-significantly influence both the location and existence of these modes.We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order,\(M_\textrm{PBH}\sim \mathcal{O}(M_{\odot })\), by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be\(\Delta N_{\textrm{Total}}\sim \mathcal{O}(60)\)and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between\(0.88\leqslant c_{s}\leqslant 1\), allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within\(10^{-3}\leqslant A \leqslant 10^{-2}\), indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small,\(M_{\textrm{PBH}}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot }\), and the large,\(M_{\textrm{PBH}}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot }\), mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.Extrapolating the Standard Model Higgs potential at high energies, we study the barrier between the electroweak and Planck scale minima. The barrier arises by taking the central values of the relevant experimental inputs, that is the strong coupling constant and the top quark and Higgs masses. We then extend the Standard Model by including a non-minimal coupling to gravity, and explore the phenomenology of the Higgs inflation model. We point out that even configurations that would be metastable in the Standard Model, become viable for inflation if the non-minimal coupling is large enough to flatten the Higgs potential at field values below the barrier; we find that the required value of the non-minimal coupling is smaller than the one needed for the conventional Higgs inflation scenario (which relies on a stable Standard Model Higgs potential, without any barrier); in addition, values of the top mass which are larger than those required in the conventional scenario are allowed.We present an extension to thePythiaMonte Carlo event generator that enables simulations of collisions between a generic hadron beam on a nuclear target with energy variation in event-by-event basis. This builds uponPythia’s module for heavy ions,Angantyr, as well as previous work on simulating hadron-proton collisions. As such, the extensions in this work are largely technical, except for a rudimentary model for hadronic fluctuations. With hadron-ion simulations, we implement an explicit vector-meson dominance (VMD) model that can be used to simulate interactions of hadronic component of real photons in photo-nuclear collisions. Such processes can be studied in ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions and in the future also with the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider. Our work also has applications to hadronic showers, e.g. air showers initiated by high-energy cosmic rays. We first validate the VMD model by comparing to HERA photoproduction data on proton target. Then we apply this to generate events for ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and present the results corresponding to the event-selection criteria matching to a recent ATLAS analysis. We find that single-particle multiplicity and rapidity distributions are well in line with the measured ones. We also construct the Fourier coefficients from two-particle correlations for the simulated events and study whether the resulting azimuthal anisotropies are consistent with the ATLAS results.Classical electromagnetic radiation from moving point charges is foundational, but the thermal dynamics responsible for classical acceleration temperature are poorly understood. We investigate the thermal properties of classical electromagnetic radiation in the context of the correspondence between accelerated electrons and moving mirrors, focusing on three trajectories with asymptotically infinite (Davies–Fulling), asymptotically zero (Walker–Davies), and eternally uniform acceleration. The latter two are argued not to be thermal, while the former is found to emit thermal photons with a temperature that depends on the electron’s speed. Thermal radiation occurs in the absence of jerk.Highly forbidden\(\beta \)decays provide a sensitive test to nuclear models in a regime  in which the decay goes through high spin-multipole states, similar to the neutrinoless double-\(\beta \)decay process. There are only 3 nuclei (50V,113Cd,115In) which undergo a\(4^\textrm{th}\)forbidden non-unique\(\beta \)decay. In this work, we compare the experimental113Cd spectrum to theoretical spectral shapes in the framework of the spectrum-shape method. We measured with high precision, with the lowest energy threshold and the best energy resolution ever, the\(\beta \)spectrum of113Cd embedded in a 0.43 kg\(\hbox {CdWO}_4\)crystal, operated over 26 days as a bolometer at low temperature in the Canfranc underground laboratory (Spain). We performed a Bayesian fit of the experimental data to three nuclear models (IBFM-2, MQPM and NSM) allowing the reconstruction of the spectral shape as well as the half-life. The fit has two free parameters, one of which is the effective weak axial-vector coupling constant,\(g_A^{\text {eff}}\), which resulted in\(g_A^{\text {eff}}\)between 1.0 and 1.2, compatible with a possible quenching. Based on the fit, we measured the half-life of the113Cd\(\beta \)decay including systematic uncertainties as\(7.73^{+0.60}_{-0.57} \times 10^{15}\)yr, in agreement with the previous experiments. These results represent a significant step towards a better understanding of low-energy nuclear processes.The configuration of a perfect fluid distribution in an electric field under the influence of higher curvature geometric effects introduced through the Gauss–Bonnet invariants is studied in the 4 dimensional Glavan–Lin gravity formulation. It is found that whereas a constant spatially directed gravitational potential gives isothermal behaviour in the standard theory, this is not the case when extra curvature is present in general. A physically viable stellar model is constructed by assuming the Finch–Skea potential. The geometry and electrodynamics are well behaved being regular throughout the distribution including the centre. The model passes stability tests such as the Chandrasekar adiabatic stability criterion and causality. Additionally all energy conditions are satisfied within the star. We compare the performance of the model with its Einstein counterpart and observe that the higher curvature exerts a notable influence on all the physical properties of the star.We propose that the thermodynamics and the kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole enclosed by a cavity can be studied in terms of the free energy landscape formalism. The generalized free energy for the black hole enclosed by a cavity in the canonical ensemble is derived by using the York’s approach, where the temperature on the cavity and the charges inside the cavity are kept as the fixed parameters. By quantifying the corresponding free energy landscape, we obtain the phase diagrams for the black hole in cavity, which reveal a Hawking–Page type transition for the uncharged black hole and a Van der Waals type transition for the charged black hole. We further assume that the dynamics of black hole state switching is mutually determined by the gradient force and the stochastic force arising from the free energy landscape and the thermal noises respectively. We then derive a recurrence relation for then-momentum of the first passage time distribution function, which enables the calculation of the kinetic times characterized by the mean first passage time and its relative fluctuation. Our analysis illustrates that the kinetics of black hole state switching is determined by the ensemble temperature and the barrier height on the free energy landscape.An asteroid’s interior dictates how its space environment changes its shape and surface, which provides a record of the collisional and dynamical evolution of the Solar System. Knowledge of asteroid interiors also enables the formulation of mitigation strategies against hazardous asteroids. Despite this importance, asteroid interiors remain poorly understood. Asteroids between 0.2 km and 10 km in diameter are thought to have rubble-pile interiors, transitioning to fractured interiors at 10 km scales, then to coherent and differentiated interiors at ≳100 km scales. The asteroid 433 Eros, the only 10-km-scale asteroid explored by a rendezvous mission, is an exemplar of asteroids at intermediate scales. Recent exploration of smaller rubble piles has provided insight into physical properties that are shared with Eros-sized objects. Here we quantify the seismic and physical properties of Eros’ interior through measurements and modelling of crater degradation and erasure from the impact that formed the 7.5-km-diameter Shoemaker crater on Eros. Our results indicate that Eros’ deep interior has a seismic wave scattering length of 0.5 ± 0.1 km and effective quality factorEQ<\({63}_{-13}^{+18}\)at frequencies >0.06 Hz. Contrary to the established view of Eros as a fractured shard, our findings suggest that Eros’ interior properties are consistent with those of a rubble-pile asteroid.Black hole (BH) mergers are natural sources of gravitational waves (GWs) and are possibly associated with electromagnetic events. Such events from a charged rotating BH with an accretion on to it could be more energetic and ultra-short-lived if the magnetic force dominates the accretion process because the attraction of ionized fluid with a strong magnetic field around the rotating BH further amplifies the acceleration of the charged particle via a gyromagnetic effect. Thus a stronger magnetic field and gravitational pull will provide an inward force to any fluid displaced in the radial direction and move it toward the axis of rotation with an increasing velocity. After many twists during rotation and the existence of restoring agents, Such events could produce a narrow intense jet starts in the form of Poynting flux along the axis of rotation resembling the Blandford–Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We investigated a charged rotating BH and obtained characteristic results (e.g., the remnant mass, magnetic field strength, luminosity, opening angle, viewing angle, and variation of viewing angle on the SGRB luminosity detection) that have a nice coincidence with rare events having GW associated with EM counterparts. This study gives a new insight into events with a strongly magnetized disk dominating the accretion process of energy extraction.Recently, the LHCb Collaboration  provided updated measurements for the lepton flavour ratios\(R_K\)and\(R_{K^*}\). The currently observed values align with the predictions of the standard model. In light of these recent updates, our investigation delves into the repercussions of new physics characterized by universal couplings to electrons and muons. We specifically focus on their impact on various observables within the\(B\rightarrow K_2^*(1430)(\rightarrow K\pi )\mu ^+ \mu ^-\)decay. These observables include the differential branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry (\(A_{FB}\)), longitudinal polarization asymmetry (\(F_L\)), and a set of optimized observables (\(P_i\)). Our findings indicate that the branching ratio of\(B\rightarrow K_2^*(\rightarrow K\pi )\mu ^+ \mu ^-\)decay can be suppressed up to\(25\%\)for various new physics solutions. Furthermore, all permissible new physics scenarios demonstrate finite enhancement in the muon forward-backward asymmetry\((A_{FB})\)as well as an increase in the value of the optimized angular observable\(P_2\). Moreover, in the presence of new physics zero crossing points for\(A_{FB}\)and\(P_2\)shift towards higher\(q^2\). The current data have a mild deviation from SM predictions in\(P_5'\)observable in the low-\(q^2\)bin. We also explored massive\(Z'\)models, which can generate universal 1D new physics scenarios, characterized by\(C_9^{NP}<0\),\(C_9^{NP}=-C_{10}^{NP}\), and\(C_9^{NP}=-C_9'\). Using additional constraints coming from\(B_s-\overline{B_s}\)mixing and neutrino trident process, we find that the conclusions of the model-independent analysis remain valid.We consider a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime having a space of positive curvature and study the cosmic evolution of dynamical vacuum energy. We utilize the dynamical system technique to study the existence of fixed points and their corresponding stability in model. The corresponding cosmological solutions describe late-time accelerating universe having decelerating era composed of radiation and matter-dominated phase. The numerical integration of autonomous system reveals that the cosmological solutions of dynamical vacuum energy model may describe the cosmic history of universe. As a consequence of the dynamical vacuum energy in closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model, the trajectories between fixed points in the phase space would also correspond to the bouncing and turnaround universe evolution.The relationship between galaxies and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is an area of active research. One way to investigate this relationship is to compare parsec-scale jets formed by SMBHs to the projected shape of their kiloparsec-scale host galaxies. Here we analyse very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) images of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and optical images of their host galaxies by comparing the inner-jet position angle in VLBI-detected radio sources with the optical shapes of galaxies as measured by several large optical surveys. In total, 6,273 galaxy–AGN pairs were found. We carefully account for the systematics of the cross-matched sources and find that Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI LS) data are significantly less affected by them. Using DESI LS data, with which 5,853 galaxy–AGN pairs were cross-matched, we find a weak but significant alignment signal (withP≲ 0.01) between the parsec-scale AGN jet and the kiloparsec-scale projected minor axis of the optical host galaxy in sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. Our results show that the observed source properties are connected over three orders of magnitude in scale. This finding points towards an intimate connection between a SMBH, its host galaxy and its subsequent evolution.The James Webb Space Telescope can potentially explore the geological diversity of the surfaces of rocky exoplanets, especially due to its access to mid-infrared wavelengths. Here we investigate the level of geological detail that it could be possible to observe with the low-resolution spectroscopy and photometric modes of the mid-infrared instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. We used new emissivity measurements of 15 basaltic samples between 2 μm and 25 μm to produce synthetic spectra and photometric fluxes. We found that the mid-infrared instrument can, in principle, distinguish several specific mineralogical and bulk chemical signals among relatively similar rocks. In particular, hydrous minerals, such as amphibole and serpentine, which would signal the existence of past or present water, can have observable characteristics in both low-resolution spectroscopy observations (with the precision of 5 eclipses) and the integrated fluxes over mid-infrared instrument filter bandwidths (20–100 eclipses). Photometric fluxes are also sensitive to bulk compositions (for example, wt% Al2O3), which reflect magmatic processes. Our work demonstrates the potential for the James Webb Space Telescope and future observatories to access a fuller picture of exoplanet surface geology.In this paper, we study the relationship between the phase transition and Lyapunov exponents for 4D Hayward anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole. We consider the motion of massless and massive particles around an unstable circular orbit of the Hayward AdS black hole in the equatorial plane and calculate the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. The phase transition is found to be well described by the multivaled Lyapunov exponents. It is also found that different phases of Hayward AdS black hole coincide with different branches of the Lyapunov exponents. We also study the discontinuous change in the Lyapunov exponents and find that it can serve as an order parameter near the critical point. The critical exponent of change in Lyapunov exponent near the critical point is found to be 1/2.The Voyager 2 flyby of Uranus in 1986 revealed an unusually oblique and off-centred magnetic field. This single in situ measurement has been the basis of our interpretation of Uranus’s magnetosphere as the canonical extreme magnetosphere of the solar system; with inexplicably intense electron radiation belts and a severely plasma-depleted magnetosphere. However, the role of external forcing by the solar wind has rarely been considered in explaining these observations. Here we revisit the Voyager 2 dataset to show that Voyager 2 observed Uranus’s magnetosphere in an anomalous, compressed state that we estimate to be present less than 5% of the time. If the spacecraft had arrived only a few days earlier, the upstream solar wind dynamic pressure would have been ~20 times lower, resulting in a dramatically different magnetospheric configuration. We postulate that such a compression of the magnetosphere could increase energetic electron fluxes within the radiation belts and empty the magnetosphere of its plasma temporarily. Therefore, the interpretation of Uranus’s magnetosphere as being extreme may simply be a product of a flyby that occurred under extreme upstream solar wind conditions.Machine learning, particularly neural networks, has rapidly permeated most activities and work where data has a story to tell. Recently, deep learning has started to be used for solving differential equations with input from physics, also known as Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs). Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) applications in numerical relativity remain mostly unexplored. To remedy this situation, we present the first study of applying PINNs to solve in the time domain the Zerilli and the Regge-Wheeler equations for Schwarzschild black hole perturbations. The fundamental difference of our work with other PINN studies in black hole perturbations is that, instead of working in the frequency domain, we solve the equations in the time domain, an approach commonly used in numerical relativity to study initial value problems. To evaluate the accuracy of PINNs results, we compare the extracted quasi-normal modes with those obtained with finite difference methods. For comparable grid setups, the PINN results are similar to those from finite difference methods and differ from those obtained in the frequency domain by a few percent. As with other applications of PINNs for solving partial differential equations, the efficiency of neural networks over other methods emerges when applied to large dimensionality or high complexity problems. Our results support the viability of PINNs in numerical relativity, but more work is needed to assess their performance in problems such as the collision of compact objects.We examine the black-hole limits of the family of static and spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein field equations for polytropic matter, that was presented in a previous paper. This exploration is done in the asymptotic sub-regions of the allowed regions of the parameter planes of that family of solutions, for a few values of the polytropic indexn, with the limitation that\(n>1\). These allowed regions were determined and discussed in some detail in another previous paper. The characteristics of these limits are examined and analyzed. We find that there are different types of black-hole limits, with specific characteristics involving the local temperature of the matter. We also find that the limits produce a very unexpected but specific type of spacetime geometry in the interior of the black holes, which we analyze in detail. Regarding the spatial part of the interior geometry, we show that in the black-hole limits there is a general collapse of all spatial distances to zero. Regarding the temporal part, there results an infinite overall red shift in the limits, with respect to the flat space at radial infinity, over the whole interior region. The analysis of the interior geometry leads to a very surprising connection with quantum-mechanical studies in the background metric of a naked Schwarzschild black hole. The nature of the solutions in the black-hole limits leads to the definition of a new type of singularity in General Relativity. We argue that the black-hole limits cannot actually be taken all the way to their ultimate conclusion, due to the fact that this would lead to the violation of some essential physical and mathematical conditions. These include questions of consistency of the solutions, questions involving infinite energies, and questions involving violations of the quantum behavior of matter. However, one can still approach these limiting situations to a very significant degree, from the physical standpoint, so that the limits can still be considered, at least for some purposes, as useful and simpler approximate representations of physically realizable configurations with rather extreme properties.Hyperboloidal slices are spacelike slices that reach future null infinity. Their asymptotic behaviour is different from Cauchy slices, which are traditionally used in numerical relativity simulations. This work uses free evolution of the formally-singular conformally compactified Einstein equations in spherical symmetry. One way to construct gauge conditions suitable for this approach relies on building the gauge source functions from a time-independent background spacetime metric. This background reference metric is set using the height function approach to provide the correct asymptotics of hyperboloidal slices of Minkowski spacetime. The present objective is to study the effect of different choices of height function on hyperboloidal evolutions via the reference metrics used in the gauge conditions. A total of 10 reference metrics for Minkowski are explored, identifying some of their desired features. They include 3 hyperboloidal layer constructions, evolved with the non-linear Einstein equations for the first time. Focus is put on long-term numerical stability of the evolutions, including small initial gauge perturbations. The results will be relevant for future (puncture-type) hyperboloidal evolutions, 3D simulations and the development of coinciding Cauchy and hyperboloidal data, among other applications.This paper is the initial part of a comprehensive study of spacetimes that admit the canonical forms of Killing tensor in General Relativity. The general scope of the study is to derive either new exact solutions of Einstein’s equations that exhibit hidden symmetries or to identify the hidden symmetries in already known spacetimes that may emerge during the resolution process. In this preliminary paper, we first introduce the canonical forms of Killing tensor, based on a geometrical approach to classify the canonical forms of symmetric 2-rank tensors, as postulated by R. V. Churchill. Subsequently, the derived integrability conditions of the canonical forms serve as additional equations transforming the under-determined system of equations, comprising of Einstein’s Field Equations and the Bianchi Identities (in vacuum with\(\Lambda \)), into an over-determined one. Using a null rotation around the null tetrad frame we manage to simplify the system of equations to the point where the geometric characterization (Petrov Classification) of the extracted solutions can be performed and their null congruences can be characterized geometrically. Therein, we obtain multiple special algebraic solutions according to the Petrov classification (D, III, N, O) where some of them appeared to be new. The latter becomes possible since our analysis is embodied with the usage of the Newman-Penrose formalism of null tetrads.Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most widespread compounds in the universe, accounting for up to ~25% of all interstellar carbon. Since most unsubstituted PAHs do not possess permanent electric dipole moments, they are invisible to radio astronomy. Constraining their abundances relies on the detection of polar chemical proxies, such as aromatic nitriles. Here we report the detection of 2-cyanopyrene and 4-cyanopyrene, isomers of the recently detected 1-cyanopyrene. We find that these isomers are present in an abundance ratio of ~2:1:2, which mirrors the number of equivalent sites available for CN addition. We conclude that there is evidence that the cyanopyrene isomers formed by direct CN addition to pyrene under kinetic control in hydrogen-rich gas at 10 K and discuss constraints on the H/CN ratio for PAHs in the Taurus molecular cloud (TMC-1). Our detections of the cyanopyrene isomers suggest that small PAHs like pyrene must be either formed in or transported to the cold interstellar medium, challenging assumptions about the origin and fate of PAHs in space.It’s widely recognized that the free energy landscape captures the essentials of thermodynamic phase transitions. In this work, we extend the findings of [1] by incorporating the nonextensive nature of black hole entropy. Specifically, the connection between black hole phase transitions and the winding number of Riemann surfaces derived through complex analysis is extended to the Rényi entropy framework. This new geometrical and nonextensive formalism is employed to predict the phase portraits of charged-flat black holes within both the canonical and grand canonical ensembles. Furthermore, we elucidate novel relations between the number of sheets comprising the Riemann surface of the Hawking–Page and Van der Waals transitions and the dimensionality of black hole spacetimes. Notably, these new numbers are consistent with those found for charged-AdS black holes in Gibbs–Boltzmann statistics, providing another significant example of the potential connection between the cosmological constant and the nonextensive Rényi parameter.In the present paper, the dual symmetries of dense quark matter phase diagram found in some massless three- and two-color NJL models in the mean field approximation have been shown to exist at a more fundamental level as dual transformations of fields and chemical potentials leaving the Lagrangian invariant. As a result, the corresponding dual symmetries of the full phase diagram can be shown without any approximation. And it has been shown not only in the NJL models, but also in framework of two- and three-color massless QCD itself. This is quite interesting, since one might say that it is not very common to show something completely non-perturbatively in QCD.Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a surprisingly abundant population of faint, dusty active galactic nuclei atz≈ 4–7. Together with the presence of supermassive black holes atz> 6, this raises questions about the formation and growth histories of early black holes. Current theories for the formation of seed black holes from the death of the first stars (that is, light seeds) and/or the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds (that is, heavy seeds) still lack observational confirmation. Here we present LID-568, a low-mass (7.2 × 106M⊙) black hole hosting powerful outflows that is observed in an extreme phase of rapid growth at redshiftz≈ 4. This object is similar to other JWST-discovered faint active galactic nuclei populations, but is bright in X-ray emission and accreting at more than 4,000% of the limit at which radiation pressure exceeds the force of gravitational attraction of the black hole (that is, super-Eddington accretion). Analysis of JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph integral field unit data reveals spatially extended Hα emission with velocities of ~−600–−500 km s−1relative to the central black hole, indicative of robust nuclear-driven outflows. LID-568 represents an elusive low-mass black hole experiencing super-Eddington accretion as invoked by models of early black hole formation. This discovery showcases a previously undiscovered key parameter space and offers crucial insights into rapid black hole growth mechanisms in the early universe.The Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) appears from fundamental symmetries in quantum field theories, but its physical origin is still to be understood. High-precision experimental searches for small PEP violations permit testing key assumptions of the Standard Model with high sensitivity. We report on a dedicated measurement with Gator, a low-background, high-purity germanium detector operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, aimed at testing PEP-violating atomic transitions in lead. The experimental technique, relying on forming a new symmetry state by introducing electrons into the pre-existing electron system through a direct current, satisfies the conditions of the Messiah-Greenberg superselection rule. No PEP violation has been observed, and an upper limit on the PEP violation probability of\(\beta ^2/2 < 4.8 \cdot 10^{-29}\)(90% CL) is set. This improves the previous constraint from a comparable measurement by more than one order of magnitude.We study dark matter scattering off\( ^4\)He and other light nuclei using chiral effective field theory. We consider scalar DM interactions and include both one- and two-nucleon scattering processes. The DM interactions and nuclear wave functions are obtained from chiral effective field theory and we work up to fourth order in the chiral expansion for the latter to investigate the chiral convergence. The results for the scattering rates can be used to determine the sensitivity of planned experiments to detect relatively light dark matter particles using\( ^4\)He. We find that next-to-leading-order scalar currents are smaller than expected from power counting for scattering off\( ^4\)He confirming earlier work. However, the results for two-nucleon corrections exhibit a linear regulator dependence indicating potential problems in the applied power counting. We observe a linear correlation between the, in principle not observable, D-wave probability of various light nuclei and the scalar two-nucleon matrix elements, again pointing towards potentially missing contributions.We investigated the Strong Cosmic Censorship (SCC) conjecture in Einstein–Power–Maxwell–de Sitter (EPMdS) black holes by analyzing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a massless neutral scalar field perturbation. Using the pseudospectral method, we calculated the QNM frequencies across various cosmological constants and nonlinear electromagnetic parameters. Our results show that for black holes far from extremality, the lowest QNM frequency\(-\text {Im} (\omega )/\kappa _-\)remains below 1/2. However, as the black holes approach extremality, the lowest mode’s\(-\text {Im} (\omega )/\kappa _-\)consistently exceeds 1/2, leading to a violation of SCC. Moreover, with a fixed cosmological constant, as the nonlinearity parameter\(\alpha \)increases, the interval of SCC violation under the charge extremality ratio narrows. Considering that\(k = 1/2 + 1/\alpha \)is inversely proportional to\(\alpha \), our results indicate that increasing the orderkof the non-linear electromagnetic field can effectively mitigate SCC violations.Antinuclei in our Galaxy may stem either from annihilation or decay of dark matter, or from collisions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, which constitute the background of indirect dark matter searches. Understanding the formation mechanism of (anti)nuclei is crucial for setting limits on their production in space. Coalescence models, which describe the formation of light nuclei from final-state interaction of nucleons, have been widely employed in high-energy collisions. In this work, we introduce ToMCCA (ToyMonteCarloCoalescenceAfterburner), which allows for detailed studies of the nuclear formation processes without the overload of general-purpose event generators. ToMCCA contains parameterizations of the multiplicity dependence of the transverse momentum distributions of protons and of the baryon-emitting source size, extracted from ALICE measurements in pp collisions at\(\sqrt{s} = 5 - 13\)TeV, as well as of the event multiplicity distributions, taken from the EPOS event generator. ToMCCA provides predictions of the deuteron transverse momentum distributions, with agreement of\(\sim 5\%\)with the experimental data. The results of ToMCCA show that the coalescence mechanism in pp collisions depends only on the event multiplicity, not on the collision system or its energy. This allows the model to be utilized for predictions at lower center-of-mass collision energies, which are the most relevant for the production of antinuclei from processes related to dark matter. This model can also be extended to heavier nuclei as long as the target nucleus wavefunction and its Wigner function are known.We discuss the problem of singularity crossing in isotropic and anisotropic universes. We study at which conditions singularities can disappear in quantum cosmology and how quantum particles behave in the vicinity of singularities. Some attempts to develop general approach to the connection between the field reparametrization and the elimination of singularities is presented as well.In order to explain the mass hierarchy and mixing pattern in the leptonic sector, we explore an extension of the Standard Model whose scalar sector includes one active and two inert doublets as well as some scalar singlets. The model includes a\(S_3\)family symmetry supplemented by extra cyclic symmetries. As a consequence of our construction, a Dark Matter (DM) candidate is predicted and its properties are consistent with the observed cosmic abundances and the constraints imposed by direct and indirect detection experiments. The model allows Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV) processes like\(\mu \rightarrow e\gamma \)and\(\mu \rightarrow 3e\), but the predicted branching ratios align with experimental limits. Additionally, our analysis elucidates the generation of the active neutrino masses through a one-loop radiative seesaw mechanism matching the observed neutrino oscillation data. The model agrees with experimental data on Higgs Diphoton decay rates and on oblique parameters.Recently, a factorization theorem was proposed for partonic flavor evolution as defined by the net flavor of the Winner-Take-All axis of a jet. We validate the factorization theorem through explicit calculation at two-loop order, and in the process extract all anomalous dimensions and renormalization factors for any ultraviolet-to-infrared flavor transition at this order. These results can then be used to extract the renormalized hard function for flavored jet production at next-to-next-to-leading order for any process of interest.We briefly analyzed the equation of state and critical points of the quantum-corrected-AdS black hole and used the Melnikov method to study its thermal chaotic behavior in the extended phase space of flat, closed, and open universes. The results show that the black hole’s thermodynamic behavior is similar to that of the Van der Waals system. Although the critical ratios at the critical points in the three types of universes differ, they are all independent of the quantum correction parameter. Only an open universe can attain the critical ratio of\(\frac{3}{8}\)corresponding to the Van der Waals system, while in the other two universes, the critical ratio is always greater than this value. For chaos, time perturbations will lead to chaotic behavior when their amplitude exceeds a critical value that depends on the quantum correction parameter and the radius of the dust sphere in the FRW model. Based on this, we found that the chaotic behavior of the black hole varies across different universes depending on the quantum correction parameter, but this parameter always makes chaos more likely. Using the value of the quantum correction parameter determined by Meissner, chaos is always more difficult to occur in an open universe compared to the other two types of universes. Which universe is most prone to chaos depends on the radius of the dust sphere. Finally, chaotic behavior is always present under spatial perturbations.Our primary goal is to compare the analytic properties of hydrodynamic series with the stability and causality conditions applied to hydrodynamic modes. Analyticity, in this context, serves as a necessary condition for hydrodynamic series to behave as a univalent function. Stability and causality adhere to physical constraints, ensuring that hydrodynamic modes neither exhibit exponential growth nor travel faster than the speed of light. Through an examination of various hydrodynamic models, such as the Müller–Israel–Stewart (MIS) and the first-order hydro models like the BDNK (Bemfica–Disconzi–Noronha–Kovtun) model, we observe no new restrictions stemming from the univalence limits in the shear channels. However, local univalence is maintained in the sound channel of these models despite the global divergence of the hydrodynamic series. Notably, differences in the sound equations between the MIS and BDNK models lead to distinct limits. The MIS model’s sound mode remains univalent at high momenta within a specific transport range. Conversely, in the BDNK model, the univalence of the sound mode extends to intermediate momenta across all stable and causal regions. Generally, the convergence radius is independent of univalence, and the given dispersion relation predominantly influences their correlation. For second-order frequency dispersions, the relationship is precise; i.e., within the convergence radius, the hydro series demonstrates univalence. However, with higher-order dispersions, the hydro series is locally univalent within certain transport regions, which may fall within or outside the stable and causal zones.In recent times, the study of the Casimir effect in quantum field theory has garnered increasing attention because of its potential to be an ideal source of exotic matter needed for stabilizing traversable wormholes. It has been confirmed through experimental evidence that this phenomenon involves fluctuations in the vacuum field, leading to a negative energy density. Motivated by the above, we have investigated Casimir wormholes with corrections from the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) within the framework of matter-coupled teleparallel gravity. Our analysis includes three well-known GUP models: the Kempf, Mangano, and Mann (KMM) model, the Detournay, Gabriel, and Spindel (DGS) model, and a third model called Model II. For a broader analysis, we have considered two well-known model functions for the teleparallel theory: a linear\(f(T,\mathcal {T})=\alpha T+\beta \mathcal {T}\)and a quadratic model\(f(T,\mathcal {T})=\eta T^2+\chi \mathcal {T}\). The shape function solutions corresponding to both models are examined in the absence of tidal forces in spacetime. We also demonstrate the crucial role played by the parameters of the\(f(T,\mathcal {T})\)models in the violation of the energy conditions. With the increasing interest in detecting gravitational waves from astrophysical objects, we have thoroughly discussed the perturbation of the wormhole solutions in the scalar, electromagnetic, axial gravitational, and Dirac field backgrounds. We employ the 3rd order WKB expansion to find the complex frequencies associated with the quasinormal modes of energy dissipation. Additionally, we also calculate the active mass and total gravitational energy for the wormhole geometry. The amount of exotic matter involved in sustaining these wormholes is also found in this paper. Furthermore, the physical stability of such Casimir wormholes is examined using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation.Building on previous work, we extend an algebraic realisation of three fermion generations within the complex Clifford algebra\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\)by incorporating a\(U(1)_{em}\)gauge symmetry. The algebra\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\)corresponds to the algebra of complex linear maps from the (complexification of the) Cayley–Dickson algebra of sedenions,\(\mathbb {S}\), to itself. Previous work represented three generations of fermions with\(SU(3)_C\)colour symmetry permuted by an\(S_3\)symmetry of order-three, but failed to include aU(1) generator that assigns the correct electric charge to all states. Furthermore, the three generations suffered from a degree of linear dependence between states. By generalising the embedding of the discrete group\(S_3\), corresponding to automorphisms of\(\mathbb {S}\), into\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\), we include an\(S_3\)-invariantU(1) that correctly assigns electric charge. First-generation states are represented in terms of two even\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\)semi-spinors, obtained from two minimal left ideals, related to each other via the order-two\(S_3\)symmetry. The remaining two generations are obtained by applying the\(S_3\)symmetry of order-three to the first generation. In this model, the gauge symmetries,\(SU(3)_C\times U(1)_{em}\), are\(S_3\)-invariant and preserve the semi-spinors. As a result of the generalised embedding of the\(S_3\)automorphisms of\(\mathbb {S}\)into\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\), the three generations are now linearly independent.State-of-the-art simulations of high-energy nuclear collisions rely on hybrid setups, involving in particular a pre-equilibrium stage to let the system evolve from a far-from-equilibrium initial condition towards a near-equilibrated state after which fluid dynamics can be applied meaningfully. A known issue is the mismatch between the equation of state in the fluid-dynamical evolution and the effective one in the previous stage, which leads to discontinuities at the interface between the two models. Here we introduce a new matching prescription at this interface, based on the entropy, and we compare it with the standard one relying on local energy conservation. We study the behavior of various quantities at the switching time between the models and investigate a number of final-state hadronic observables. For the latter, we show that they are not modified significantly by the choice of matching prescription, provided an appropriate normalization is chosen for the initial state. In turn, our approach reduces sizeably the ratio of bulk over thermodynamic pressure at the beginning of the fluid-dynamical stage.In this paper, we explore the quantum properties of three-flavor neutrino propagating in a Schwarzschild metric. It is found that the different strength of gravitational effects are obtained by adjusting the magnitude of\(\mathrm GM\)arising in the oscillation phase. Using the weak field approximations, we show that the gravitational effects can make the entanglement oscillates over a large rage when\(\textrm{GM}=5.1\times 10^8 \, \textrm{Km}\)and\(\textrm{GM}=7\times 10^7 \, \textrm{Km}\), respectively, Moreover, for\(\textrm{GM}=4.8\times 10^8 \, \textrm{Km}\)and\(\textrm{GM}=9.3\times 10^7 \, \textrm{Km}\), the suppression of the entanglement can be observed due to the gravitational effects. Meanwhile, in this case, the gravitational effects also make the distribution of entanglement tighter through investing the entanglement complete monogamy relation. Furthermore, we examine the gravitational effects on the violation of the Svetlichny inequality to study the nonlocality of the system. It is shown that when\(\textrm{GM}=6\times 10^8 \, \textrm{Km}\)and\(\textrm{GM}=7\times 10^7 \, \textrm{Km}\), the gravitational effects make the Svetlichny parameters always greater than 4, implying that the genuine tripartite nonlocality of the system is always present. However, the gravitational effects also restrain the violation of the Svetlichny to make the regions of the absence of nonlocality increase. The gravitational effects on the monogamy property of nonlocality lies in the change of the effective bound of the maximum bipartite nonlocality of the neutrinos system. Therefore, our investigations may be helpful to understanding of quantumness of the neutrinos system in curved space-time.The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered a surprising population of bright galaxies in the very early Universe (≲500 Myr after the Big Bang) that is hard to explain with conventional galaxy-formation models and whose physical properties are not fully understood. Insight into their internal physics is best captured through nebular lines, but at these early epochs, the brightest of these spectral features are redshifted into the mid-infrared and remain elusive. Using the mid-infrared instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope, here we present a detection of Hα and doubly ionized oxygen ([Oiii] 4959,5007 Å) from the bright, ultra-high-redshift galaxy candidate GHZ2/GLASS-z12. Based on these emission lines, we infer a spectroscopic redshift ofz= 12.33 ± 0.04, placing this galaxy just ~400 Myr after the Big Bang. These observations provide key insights into the conditions of this primaeval, luminous galaxy, which shows hard ionizing conditions rarely seen in the local Universe and probably driven by a compact and young burst (≲30 Myr) of star formation. The galaxy’s oxygen-to-hydrogen abundance is close to a tenth of the solar value, indicating a rapid metal enrichment. This study establishes the unique conditions of this notably bright and distant galaxy and the huge potential of mid-infrared observations to characterize these primordial systems.Inspired by the great progress in the observations of charmonium-like states in recent years, we perform a systematic analysis about the ground states and the first radially excited states of\(qc\bar{q}\bar{c}\)(q=u/dands) tetraquark systems. Their mass spectra, root mean square (r.m.s.) radii and radial density distributions are predicted within the framework of relativized quark model. By comparing with experimental data, some potential candidates for hidden-charm tetraquark states are suggested. For\(qc\bar{q}\bar{c}\)(q=u/d) system, if\(Z_{c}(3900)\)is supposed to be a compact tetraquark state with\(J^{PC}=1^{+-}\),Z(4430) can be interpreted as the first radially excited states of\(Z_{c}(3900)\). Another broad structure\(Z_{c}(4200)\)can also be explained as a partner of\(Z_{c}(3900)\), and it arise from a higher state with\(J^{PC}=1^{+-}\). In addition, theoretical predictions indicate that the possible assignments forX(3930),X(4050) andX(4250) are low lying\(0^{++}\)tetraquark states. As for the\(sc\bar{s}\bar{c}\)system,X(4140) andX(4274) structures can be interpreted as this type of tetraquark states with\(J^{PC}=1^{++}\), andX(4350) can be described as a\(sc\bar{s}\bar{c}\)tetraquark with\(J^{PC}=0^{++}\). With regard to\(qc\bar{s}\bar{c}\)(q=u/d) system, we find two potential candidates for this type of tetraquark, which are\(Z_{cs}(4000)\)and\(Z_{cs}(4220)\)structures. The measured masses of these two structures are in agreement with theoretical predictions for the\(1^{+}\)state.This paper describes measurements of the transverse momentum spectra ofWandZbosons produced in proton–proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of\(\sqrt{s}=5.02\)TeV and\(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Measurements are performed in the electron and muon channels,\(W\rightarrow \ell \nu \)and\(Z\rightarrow \ell \ell \)(\(\ell =e\)or\(\mu \)), and forWevents further separated by charge. The data were collected in 2017 and 2018, in dedicated runs with reduced instantaneous luminosity, and correspond to 255 and 338\(\hbox {pb}^{-1}\)at\(\sqrt{s}=5.02\)TeV and 13 TeV, respectively. These conditions optimise the reconstruction of theW-boson transverse momentum. The distributions observed in the electron and muon channels are unfolded, combined, and compared to QCD calculations based on parton shower Monte Carlo event generators and analytical resummation. The description of the transverse momentum distributions by Monte Carlo event generators is imperfect and shows significant differences largely common to\(W^-\),\(W^+\)andZproduction. The agreement is better at\(\sqrt{s}=5.02\)TeV, especially for predictions that were tuned toZproduction data at\(\sqrt{s}=7\)TeV. Higher-order, resummed predictions based onDYTurbogenerally match the data best across the spectra. Distribution ratios are also presented and test the understanding of differences between the production processes.Nearly one-third of objects occupying the most circular, coplanar Kuiper belt orbits (the cold classical belt) are binary, and several percent of them are ‘ultra-wide’ binaries (UWBs): ~100-km-sized companions spaced by tens of thousands of kilometres. UWBs are dynamically fragile, and their existence is thought to constrain the early Solar System processes and conditions. However, we demonstrate that UWBs can instead attain their wide architectures well after the earliest epochs of the Solar System, when the orbital migration of Neptune implants the modern non-cold, or ‘dynamic’, Kuiper belt population. During this implantation, cold classical belt binaries are likely to have close encounters with many planetesimals scattered across the region, which can efficiently dissociate any existing UWBs and widen a small fraction of tighter binaries into UWB-like arrangements. Thus, today’s UWBs may not be primordial and cannot be used to constrain the early Solar System as directly as previously surmised.We give a family of exact solutions of\(N=1\)supergravity field equations in\(D=4\)dimensions that describe the collision of plane-fronted gravitino waves.The CYGNO experiment aims to build a large (\(\mathcal {O}(10)\)m\(^3\)) directional detector for rare event searches, such as nuclear recoils (NRs) induced by dark matter (DM), such as weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs). The detector concept comprises a time projection chamber (TPC), filled with a He:CF\(_4\)60/40 scintillating gas mixture at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, equipped with an amplification stage made of a stack of three gas electron multipliers (GEMs) which are coupled to an optical readout. The latter consists in scientific CMOS (sCMOS) cameras and photomultipliers tubes (PMTs). The maximisation of the light yield of the amplification stage plays a major role in the determination of the energy threshold of the experiment. In this paper, we simulate the effect of the addition of a strong electric field below the last GEM plane on the GEM field structure and we experimentally test it by means of a 10\(\times \)10 cm\(^2\)readout area prototype. The experimental measurements analyse stacks of different GEMs and helium concentrations in the gas mixture combined with this extra electric field, studying their performances in terms of light yield, energy resolution and intrinsic diffusion. It is found that the use of this additional electric field permits large light yield increases without degrading intrinsic characteristics of the amplification stage with respect to the regular use of GEMs.In this paper, we study the discovery potential of a Vector-LikeBquark (VLB) via the process\(pp \rightarrow B(\rightarrow bZ)j\rightarrow b(Z \rightarrow \nu _l\bar{\nu _l})j\)at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with\(\sqrt{s}=14\)TeV. In the framework of a simplified model, we perform a scan over its parameter space and test its viability following a Monte Carlo analysis developed to include all production and decay dynamics. We use cut-and-count combined with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) methods to classify the signal and background events in order to improve the efficiency of signal identification and background rejection. We find that this approach can reduce background events significantly while the signal retention rate is much higher than that of traditional methods, thereby improving the VLB discovery potential. We then calculate the exclusion and discovery capabilities for VLBs and find that the advantages of the cut-and-count plus XGBoost method especially lie in the high-mass region, i.e.,\(m_B > 1500 \text { GeV}\). We finally obtain the following LHC results in terms of the coupling and chiral structure of a singlet heavy VLB interactions: (i) for\(g^{*}=0.2\)and\(R_L=0\)with 3000 fb\(^{-1}\), theBquark mass can be be excluded (discovered) up to 3000 GeV (2500 GeV); (ii) for\(g^{*}=0.2\)and\(R_L=0.5\)with 3000 fb\(^{-1}\), the exclusion (discovery) region can reach up to 4750 GeV (4250 GeV).Motivated by the impact of the phantom field (or anti-Maxwell field) on the structure of three-dimensional black holes in the presence of the cosmological constant, we present the first extraction of solutions for the phantom BTZ (A)dS black hole. In this study, we analyze the effect of the phantom field on the horizon structure. Furthermore, we compare the BTZ black holes in the presence of both the phantom and Maxwell fields. Additionally, we calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the phantom BTZ black holes, demonstrating their compliance with the first law of thermodynamics. Subsequently, we assess the effects of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on the local stability in the canonical ensemble by considering these fields with respect to the heat capacity. We then investigate the global stability area of the BTZ black holes with phantom and Maxwell fields within the grand canonical ensemble using Gibbs free energy. In this analysis, we evaluate the influence of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on this area.Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE\(\nu \)NS) poses an irreducible background in the search for dark matter-nucleus elastic scatterings, which is commonly known as the neutrino floor. As direct dark matter search experiments keep improving their sensitivity into so far unexplored regions, they face the challenge of approaching this neutrino floor. A precise description of the CE\(\nu \)NS signal is therefore crucial for the description of backgrounds for future DM searches. In this work we discuss the scenario of detecting neutrinos in low-threshold, high-exposure cryogenic solid state experiments optimized for the search of low-mass dark matter. The energy range considered is completely dominated by solar neutrinos. In absence of any dark matter events, we treat solar neutrinos as the main signal of interest. We show that sensitivity to the flux of neutrinos from different production mechanisms can be achieved. In particular we investigate the sensitivity to the flux of pp and\(^{7}\)Be neutrinos, as well as CNO neutrinos. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity to dark matter signals in the presence of a solar neutrino background for different experimental scenarios, which are defined by three parameters: the target material, the energy threshold and the exposure. We show that experiments with thresholds of\(\mathcal {O}\)(eV) and exposures of\(\mathcal {O}\)(tonne-years), using\(\hbox {CaWO}_{4}\)or\(\hbox {Al}_{2}\hbox {O}_{3}\)targets, have discovery potential for dark matter interaction cross sections in the neutrino floor.We study the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon,\(g_\mu - 2 \equiv 2 a_\mu \), in the context of supersymmetric models beyond the CMSSM, where the unification of either the gaugino masses\(M_{1,2,3}\)or sfermion and Higgs masses is relaxed, taking into account the measured mass of the Higgs boson,\(m_H\), the cosmological dark matter density and the direct detection rate. We find that the model with non-unified gaugino masses can make a contribution\(\Delta a_\mu \sim 20 \times 10^{-10}\)to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, for example if\(M_{1,2} \sim 600\; \textrm{GeV}\)and\(M_3\sim 8 \; \textrm{TeV}\). The model with non-universal sfermion and Higgs masses can provide even larger\(\Delta a_\mu \sim 24 \times 10^{-10}\)if the sfermion masses for the first and the second generations are\( \sim 400 \; \textrm{GeV}\)and that of the third is\( \sim 8 \; \textrm{TeV}\). We discuss the prospects for collider searches for supersymmetric particles in specific benchmark scenarios illustrating these possibilities, focusing in particular on the prospects for detecting the lighter smuon and the lightest neutralino.In this paper, we investigate the time dependent black holes in the frame of Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet theory having two scalar fields and investigate the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW). In the reconstructed models, there often appear ghosts, which could be eliminated by imposing some constraints. We investigate the behavior of high-frequency gravitational waves by examining the effects of varying Gauss–Bonnet coupling during their propagation. The speed of propagation changes due to the coupling during the black hole formation process. The propagation speed of gravitational waves differs when they enter the black hole compared to when they exit.Testing possible variations in fundamental constants of nature is a crucial endeavor in observational cosmology. This paper investigates potential cosmological variations in the fine structure constant (\(\alpha \)) through a non-parametric approach, using galaxy cluster observations as the primary cosmological probe. We employ two methodologies based on galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements derived from X-ray and Sunyaev–Zeldovich observations, along with luminosity distances from type Ia supernovae. We also explore how different values of the Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) impact the variation of\(\alpha \)across cosmic history. When using the Planck satellite’s\(H_0\)observations, a constant\(\alpha \)is ruled out at approximately the 3\(\sigma \)confidence level for\(z \lesssim 0.5\). Conversely, employing local estimates of\(H_0\)restores agreement with a constant\(\alpha \).The electron-positron pair (EPP) creation under Gaussian and super-Gaussian pulse trains are studied by the computational quantum field theory (CQFT) in the single-photon regime. The details of the EPP creation are studied from the time evolution of the EPP number, energy spectra and spatial distribution of the electrons. The results indicate that the final created EPPs is the non-linear accumulation of the multi-pulses, which depends on the time interval, pulse shape and pulse number. The optimal time interval can be chosen based on the pulse resonance condition, which is derived by the perturbation method. Besides, steeper super-Gaussian pulses and adding more pulses facilitate the EPP creation as well. The results indicate that, under optimal multi-pulse parameters, the number of the EPPs obtained is much larger than the sum of the EPPs created under the same number of single pulses. This finding not only can enhance the EPP creation, but also can improve the multi-pulse utilization and guide future experimental research on the EPP creation.Astrophysical fluids subjected to the strong gravity of black holes can form rotating toroidal-like structures known as thick accretion discs. In order to facilitate the study of such structures, we introduce approximate empirical formulae for a relatively simple analytical description of their poloidal cross-sections that are usually described only numerically. Our comparisons of the approximate and exact descriptions of the cross-sections of the structures rotating around Schwarzschild and Kerr central black holes, together with the determination of the associated total masses of these structure, indicate a high degree of accuracy for these introduced formulae.Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are a powerful tool for testing gravity theories, probing gravitational and electromagnetic field properties, and obtaining constraints on the black hole and field parameters. This work considers charged particle dynamics near uniformly magnetized black holes in braneworlds. First, we obtain the solution of the Maxwell equation for magnetic fields and calculate the radial and angular magnetic field components. We derive and analyze the effective potential of charged particles for circular orbits and investigate the energy and angular momentum for the circular orbits. We also analyze the combined effects of magnetic interaction and braneworlds on the charged particles’ innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). We calculate the angular momentum of charged particles in Keplerian orbits in the presence of an external magnetic field and braneworlds. Also, we investigate frequencies of the particle oscillations along vertical and angular directions. We applied our studies on particle oscillations to the QPO studies in the relativistic precession model. Finally, we obtain constraints on magnetic interaction and braneworld parameters together with the black hole mass and QPO orbits using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation in the four-dimensional parameter space for the QPOs observed in the microquasars XTE J1550-564, GRO J1655-40 & GRS 1915-105, and at the center of galaxies M82 and Milky Way.The operational framework for the superposition of spacetime is fundamentally important in developing a comprehensive description of quantum gravity (Foo et al. in Phys Rev Lett 129:181301, 2022). As a “bottom-up” unifying theory of quantum gravity, it allows us to investigate how mass superposition of spacetime influences the performance of quantum information processing. In this paper, we study how the quantum-gravitational effects produced by the mass superposition of a black hole influence the quantum coherence of fermionic fields. It is shown that the spacetime effects associated with a classical black hole lead to inevitable decoherence. Notably, compared to classical black hole spacetime scenarios, fermionic fields near a black hole with superposed masses can retain more quantum coherence. This suggests that the quantum properties of spacetime may serve as resources to mitigate coherent degradation caused by gravitational effects. The bottom-up perspective on spacetime superposition proposed in this work serves as an indication of quantum-gravitational effects and holds significant theoretical implications.We explore the entanglement dynamics of two detectors undergoing uniform acceleration and circular motion within a massive scalar field, while also investigating the influence of the anti-Unruh effect on entanglement harvesting. Contrary to the conventional understanding of the weak anti-Unruh effect, where entanglement typically increases, we observe that the maximum entanglement between detectors does not exhibit a strict monotonic dependence on detector acceleration. Particularly at low accelerations, fluctuations in the entanglement maxima show a strong correlation with fluctuations in detector transition rates. We also find that the maximum entanglement of detectors tends to increase with smaller field mass. Novelly, our findings indicate the absence of a strong anti-Unruh effect in (3+1)-dimensional massive scalar fields. Instead, thermal effects arising from acceleration contribute to a decrease in the detector entanglement maximum.The late-time behaviour of the solutions of the Fackerell–Ipser equation (which is a wave equation for the spin-zero component of the electromagnetic field strength tensor) on the closure of the domain of outer communication of sub-extremal Kerr spacetime is studied numerically. Within the Kerr family, the case of Schwarzschild background is also considered. Horizon-penetrating compactified hyperboloidal coordinates are used, which allow the behaviour of the solutions to be observed at the event horizon and at future null infinity as well. For the initial data, pure multipole configurations that have compact support and are either stationary or non-stationary are taken. It is found that with such initial data the solutions of the Fackerell–Ipser equation converge at late times either to a known static solution (up to a constant factor) or to zero. As the limit is approached, the solutions exhibit a quasinormal ringdown and finally a power-law decay. The exponents characterizing the power-law decay of the spherical harmonic components of the field variable are extracted from the numerical data for various values of the parameters of the initial data, and based on the results a proposal for a Price’s law relevant to the Fackerell–Ipser equation is made. Certain conserved energy and angular momentum currents are used to verify the numerical implementation of the underlying mathematical model. In the construction of these currents a discrete symmetry of the Fackerell–Ipser equation, which is the product of an equatorial reflection and a complex conjugation, is also taken into account.Semileptonic three-body\(D \rightarrow M\ell ^+\nu _\ell \)decays, non-leptonic\(M \rightarrow VP\)decays, and semileptonic four-body\(D \rightarrow M(M \rightarrow VP)\ell ^+\nu _\ell \)decays are analyzed using the SU(3) flavor symmetry/breaking approach, where\(\ell =e/\mu \),\(M=A/T\), andA/T/V/Pdenote the axial-vector/tensor/vector/pseudoscalar mesons, respectively. In terms of SU(3) flavor symmetry/breaking, the decay amplitudes of the\(D \rightarrow M \ell ^+ \nu _\ell \)decays and the vertex coefficients of the\(M \rightarrow VP\)decays are related. The relevant non-perturbative parameters of the\(D \rightarrow A\ell ^+\nu _\ell \),\(A \rightarrow VP\), and\(T \rightarrow VP\)decays are constrained by the present experimental data, and the non-perturbative parameters of\(D \rightarrow T\ell ^+\nu _\ell \)decays are taken from the results in the light-front quark model since no experimental data are available at present. The branching ratios of the\(D \rightarrow M \ell ^+ \nu _\ell \),\(M \rightarrow VP\), and\(D\rightarrow M(M\rightarrow VP)\ell ^+\nu _\ell \)decays are then predicted. We find that some processes receive both tensor and axial-vector resonant contributions, while other processes receive only axial-vector resonant contributions. In cases where both kinds of resonant contributions exist, the axial-vector contributions are dominant. Some branching ratios with axial-vector resonance states are large, and they may be measured experimentally in the near future. In addition, the sensitivities of the branching ratios of\(D \rightarrow A \ell ^+ \nu _\ell \)and\(A \rightarrow VP\)decays to the parameters are also investigated, and some decay branching ratios are found to be sensitive to the non-perturbative parameters.In this study, we present an exact solution to the Einstein field equations, featuring a static, spherically symmetric, anisotropic compact stellar fluid sphere with non-zero complexity. The model is constructed using a specific metric potential for the\(g_{tt}\)component, along with a defined complexity profile. The model parameters are fixed by ensuring the continuity of the interior and exterior metrics across the surface of the star and by setting the radial pressure to zero across the boundary. The stability of the model has been analyzed by verification of different standard conditions. Validation of our model is supported by recent observational data from well-known pulsars.We study the production of hyperon resonances in the\(p\bar{p}\rightarrow \bar{\Lambda }\Sigma \eta \)reaction within an effective Lagrangian approach. The model includes the production of\(\Sigma (1750)\)and\(\Lambda (1670)\)in the intermediate state excited by theKand\(K^*\)meson exchanges between the initial proton and antiproton. Due to the large coupling of\(\Sigma (1750)\Sigma \eta \)vertex,\(\Sigma (1750)\)is found a significant contribution near the threshold in this reaction. We provide total and differential cross section predictions for the reaction and discuss the possible influence of\(\Sigma (1750)\Sigma \eta \)vertex coupling and model parameters, which will be useful in future experimental studies. This reaction can provide a platform for studying the features of\(\Sigma (1750)\)resonance, especially the coupling to\(\Sigma \eta \)channel.The recent anomaly observed in NO\(\nu \)A and T2K experiments in standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation could potentially signal physics extending beyond the standard model (SM). For the NSI parameters that can accommodate this anomaly, we explore the violation of Leggett–Garg type inequalities (LGtI) within the context of three-flavor neutrino oscillations. Our analysis focuses on LGtI violations in scenarios involving complex NSI with\(\epsilon _{e\mu }\)or\(\epsilon _{e\tau }\)coupling in long baseline accelerator experiments for normal and inverted mass ordering. LGtI violation is significantly enhanced in normal ordering (NO) for\(\epsilon _{e\tau }\)scenario for T2K, NO\(\nu \)A, and DUNE experiment set-up. We find that for inverted ordering (IO), in the DUNE experimental set-up above 8.5 GeV, the LGtI violation can be an indication of\(\epsilon _{e\tau }\)new physics scenario.Understanding the behavior of the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales beyond the\(\Lambda \)CDM model is crucial for accurately predicting the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe in non-standard cosmologies. In this work, we present an analysis of the non-linear matter power spectrum within the framework of interacting dark energy-dark matter cosmologies (IDE). We employ N-body simulations and theoretical models to investigate the impact of IDE on these non-linear scales. Beginning with N-body simulations characterized by a fixed parameter space delineated by prior observational research, we adeptly fit the simulated spectra with a simple parametric function, achieving accuracy within 5%. Subsequently, we refine a modified halo model tailored to the IDE cosmology, exhibiting exceptional precision in fitting the simulations down to scales of approximately 1 h/Mpc. To assess the model’s robustness, we conduct a forecast analysis for the Euclid survey, employing our refined model. We find that the coupling parameter\(\xi \)will be constrained to\(\sigma (\xi ) = 0.0110\). This marks a significant improvement by an order of magnitude compared to any other current observational tests documented in the literature. These primary findings pave the way for a novel preliminary approach, enabling the utilization of IDE models for observational constraints concerning LSS data on non-linear scales.The Weyl typef(Q,T) gravity is the modification off(Q) gravity andf(Q,T) theories, where non-metricity is denoted byQandTis the trace of the energy–momentum tensor. Together with a geometric explanation for dark energy, the theory can provide an exact interpretation of the transformation of the late-time Universe and the observable data. In this study, we present an accelerated cosmic model of the Universe inf(Q,T) gravity. We consider the model off(Q,T) gravity as,\(f(Q,T) = -Q+\phi (Q,T)\). We examine the energy condition for the model off(Q,T) gravity and find out that our model satisfies the null and strong energy conditions at the same time, it violates the weak and dominant energy conditions. After that, we perform the phase-space study of our cosmological model with and without interaction independently. In case of the absence of interaction, we get six critical points out of which three critical points are stable critical points while the rest three critical points are saddle. When we perform the stability analysis in the presence of interaction, we get three critical points out of which one critical point is stable while the rest two are saddle points. The phase-plot analysis also shows the cosmological models inf(Q,T) gravity.This paper reports a summary of searches for a fermionic dark matter candidate in the context of theoretical models characterised by a mediator particle  exchange in thes-channel. The data sample considered consists ofppcollisions delivered by the Large Hadron Collider during its Run 2 at a centre-of-mass energy of\(\sqrt{s} = 13\,\textrm{TeV}\)and recorded by the ATLAS detector, corresponding to up to 140 fb\(^{-1}\). The interpretations of the results are based on simplified models where the new mediator particles can be spin-0, with scalar or pseudo-scalar couplings to fermions, or spin-1, with vector or axial-vector couplings to fermions. Exclusion limits are obtained from various searches characterised by final states with resonant production of Standard Model particles, or production of Standard Model particles in association with large missing transverse momentum.In this study, we explore the transformation of\(D_p\)-branes to\(D_{p-1}\)-branes under T-duality when theD-brane is embedded in a spacetime with a boundary. Our goal is to derive the higher-derivative corrections to the Dirac–Born–Infeld (DBI) Lagrangian for both the bulk and boundary terms. For the bulk terms, we calculate the\(\alpha '\)corrections for the massless open string fields, up to the 8th order in the dimensionless Maxwell field strength. We demonstrate that the bulk Lagrangian can satisfy the T-duality constraint without residual total derivative terms in the base space. This determines the most general independent couplings of the massless open string fields in the bulk Lagrangian, encompassing 145 coupling constants, up to three parameters. Two of these parameters are physical and are determined by disk-level S-matrix elements, while the third is unphysical and can be eliminated by field redefinitions and integration by parts. The final result for the bulk Lagrangian consists of 49 couplings. For the boundary terms, the application of T-duality symmetry to massless open and closed string fields enables us to extend the DBI Lagrangian to include the boundary unit normal vector field\(n_\mu \)and its first derivative.In traditional QCD sum rules, the simple hadron spectral density model of the “delta-function-type ground state + theta-function-type continuous spectrum” determines that there is no perfect parameter selection. In recent years, inverse problem methods, particularly the inverse matrix method, have shown better handling of QCD sum rules. This work continues to develop the inverse matrix method. Considering that the narrow-width approximation may still be a good approximation, we separate the ground state from the spectral density. We then follow the general steps of the inverse matrix method to extract physical quantities such as decay constants that we may be more interested in.The discovery of the top quark, the most massive elementary particle yet known, has given us a distinct window into investigating the physics of the Standard Model and beyond. With a plethora of top quarks to be produced in the high luminosity era of the LHC, the exploration of its rare decays holds great promise in revealing potential new physics phenomena. We consider higher-dimensional operators contributing to flavour-changing-neutral-current top decays in the SMEFT and its extension by a light singlet species of spin 0, 1/2, or 1, and exhibit that the HL-LHC (and other future colliders) may observe many exotic top decays in a variety of channels. Light singlets which primarily talk to the SM through such a top interaction may also lead to distinctive long-lived particle signals. Searching for such long-lived particles in top-quark decays has the additional advantage that the SM decay of the other top quark in the same event provides a natural trigger.The holographic dark energy (HDE) model resides in quantum gravity in connection with the entropy, which requires an appropriate IR-cutoff to support the accelerating universe. Of these, the BHDE is corresponding to the quantum-corrected Barrow entropy\(S_{B}\propto A^{1+\Delta /2}\)for which the Granda–Oliveros (GO) IR-cutoff\(L_{IR}=(\alpha H^2 + \beta \dot{H})^{-\frac{1}{2}}\)avoids the causality problem of the typically used future event-horizon. As the cosmological evolution of the model has recently been studied, we include the relic-neutrinos to constraint the well-motivated model’s parameters (\(\alpha , \beta , \Delta \)) along with the total mass of neutrinos\(\sum m_{\nu }\)and the effective number of their species\(N_{eff}\)using a variety of the latest observational data. Utilizing the basic observations from 2018 Planck CMB-data, BAO-data, Pantheon sample of type Ia supernovae (SNIa),H(z) measurements of cosmic chronometers (CC) and various combinations of them, we find\(\sum m_{\nu } < 0.119\)eV (95 % CL) for CMB + ALL combination, aligning with\(\sum m_{\nu } < 0.12\)eV, (95% CL) of 2018 Planck release plus BAO data. The value of\(N_{eff}=2.98^{+0.25}_{-0.25}\)(68% CL) is also determined which is consistent with BAO+Planck’s\(N_{eff}=2.99^{+0.17}_{-0.17}\)(68% CL). The AIC analysis shows that the model (especially its\(\alpha =1\)case) is (mildly) favored over the concordance\(\Lambda \)CDM for that complete combination. Furthermore, the Barrow–Granda–Oliveros parameters are found in using the above datasets, as they get\(\alpha =0.98^{+0.06}_{-0.06}\),\(\beta =0.597^{+0.07}_{-0.08}\)and\(\Delta =0.0054^{+0.0076}_{-0.0076}\)for CMB + ALL combination, where are in agreement with previous studies. The use of these best-fitting values in plotting the deceleration parameterq(z) shows that the universe undergoes a deceleration-acceleration transition at\(z_{tr}=0.63\), by entering the current phase of dark-energy domination with\(q_0=-\,0.573\).We study possible hints towards confinement in a\(\hbox {Z}_2\)-invariant Yukawa system with massless fermions and a real scalar field in the strongly-coupled regime. Using the tools developed for studying non-perturbative physics via Jacobi elliptical functions, for a given but not unique choice of the vacuum state, we find the exact Green’s function for the scalar sector so that, after integrating out the scalar degrees of freedom, we are able to recover the low-energy limit of the theory that is a fully non-local Nambu–Jona–Lasinio (NJL) model. We provide an analytical result for the renormalization group (RG) running of the self-interaction coupling in the scalar sector in the strongly-coupled regime. In the fermion sector, we provide some clues towards confinement, after deriving the gap equation with the non-local NJL model, a property which is well-known to not emerge in the local limit of this model. We conclude that, for the scalar-Yukawa theory in the non-perturbative domain with our choice of the vacuum state, the fundamental fermions of the theory form bound states and cannot be observed as asymptotic states.Condensation processes, which are responsible for the main chemical differences between gas and solids in the Galaxy, are the major mechanisms that control the cycle of dust from evolved stars to planetary systems. However, they are still poorly understood, mainly because the thermodynamics and kinetic models of nucleation or grain growth lack experimental data. To bridge this gap, we used a large-volume three-phase alternating-current plasma torch to obtain a full high-temperature condensation sequence at an elevated carbon-to-oxygen ratio from a fluxed chondritic gas composition. We show that the crystallized suites of carbides, silicides, nitrides, sulfides, oxides and silicates and the bulk composition of the condensates are properly modelled by a kinetically inhibited condensation scenario controlled by gas flow. This validates the thermodynamic predictions of the condensation sequence at a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio. On this basis and using appropriate optical properties, we also demonstrate the influence of pressure on dust chemistry as well as the low probability of forming and detecting iron silicides in asymptotic giant branch C-rich circumstellar environments as well as in our chondritic meteorites. By demonstrating the potential of predicting dust mineralogy in these environments, this approach holds high promise for quantitatively characterizing dust composition and formation in diverse astrophysical settings.Accretion processes near black hole candidates are associated with the high-energy emission of radiation from relativistic particles and outflows. It is widely believed that the magnetic field plays a crucial role in explaining these high-energy processes near these astrophysical sources. In this work, we analyze thin accretion disks in the Bocharova–Bronnikov–Melnikov–Bekenstein (BBMB) spacetime framework using the Novikov–Thorne model. Our study examines the thermal and optical characteristics of these disks, including their emission rate and luminosity in the specified spacetime. Later, we extend the Novikov–Thorne model to ionized thin accretion disk. We propose that the black hole is embedded in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. We investigate the dynamics of charged particles near a weakly magnetized black hole. Our findings show that, in the presence of a magnetic field, the radius of the marginally stable circular orbit (MSCO) for a charged particle is close to the black hole’s horizon. The orbital velocity of the charged particle, as measured by a local observer, has been computed in the presence of the external magnetic field. We also present an analytical expression for the four-acceleration of the charged particle orbiting around black holes. Finally, we determine the intensity of the radiation emitted by the accelerating relativistic charged particle orbiting the magnetized black hole.We develop an effective and methodical algorithm for the construction of general covariant four-point\(H\ell \ell Z\)vertices, accommodating leptons\(\ell =e, \mu \), and designed to handle a bosonHof any integer spin, not merely confined to spins up to 2. While our numerical analysis assumes theH-boson mass to be\(m_H=125\,\textrm{GeV}\), the analytical framework we propose is versatile, enabling the examination of various mass as well as spin scenarios. These meticulously devised general covariant four-point\(H\ell \ell Z\)vertices are pivotal in vetoing all the imposters of the Standard Model Higgs boson holding the spin-0 and even-parity quantum numbers, especially in one of its primary decay channels, the three-body decay process\(H\rightarrow \ell ^-\ell ^+ Z\), observable at the Large Hadron Collider. Our innovative strategy encompasses the analysis of all the effectively allowed scenarios, extending beyond the limitations of previous investigations on the Higgs spin and parity determinations in the decay\(H \rightarrow \ell ^-\ell ^+ Z\). Based on the significantly expanded scheme, we demonstrate that the Higgs boson imposter of any spin and parity can be definitively vetoed by leveraging angular and invariant mass distributions focusing on threshold effects. Even though achieving such conclusive results in practical and exhaustive analyses may necessitate high event rates, especially in the spin-0 contact-interaction case.The decay of theDmeson into multibody final states is a complex process that provides valuable insights into the fundamental interactions within the Standard Model of particle physics. This study focuses on the decay cascade\(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}_{J} \ell ^{+}\nu \rightarrow K^{\pm }\pi ^{\mp } \ell ^{+}\nu \)where the\(K^*_J\)resonance encompasses the\(K^*(892),K^{*}(1410),K^{*}_0(1430)\)states. We employ the helicity amplitude technique to derive the angular distributions for the decay chain, enabling the extraction of one-dimensional and two-dimensional distributions. Utilizing form factors for the\(D\rightarrow K^*\)transition derived from the quark model, we calculate the differential and integrated partial decay widths, explicitly considering the electron and muon masses. Decay branching fractions are calculated, the ratios of the branching fractions are found to be\(\frac{\mathcal {B}r(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}(892)(\rightarrow K ^{-}\pi ^{+}) \, \mu ^{+}\nu _{\mu })}{\mathcal {B}r(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}(892)(\rightarrow K ^{-}\pi ^{+}) \, e^{+}\nu _{e})} = 0.975\),\(\frac{\mathcal {B}r(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}(1410)(\rightarrow K ^{-}\pi ^{+}) \, \mu ^{+}\nu _{\mu })}{\mathcal {B}r(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}(1410)(\rightarrow K ^{-}\pi ^{+}) \, e^{+}\nu _{e})} = 0.714\)and\(\frac{\mathcal {B}r(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}_{0}(1430)(\rightarrow K ^{+}\pi ^{-}) \, \mu ^{+}\nu _{\mu })}{\mathcal {B}r(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}_{0}(1430)(\rightarrow K ^{+}\pi ^{-}) \, e^{+}\nu _{e})} = 0.774\). Results in this work will serve a calibration for the study of\(c \rightarrow s \)inDmeson decays in future and provide useful information towards the understanding of the properties of the\(K^{*}\)meson, as well as\(K \pi \)system.In this paper, we explore cosmological bouncing solutions to investigate the cosmic evolution in the framework of energy-momentum squared gravity. We consider flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker spacetime with a perfect matter distribution. We assume two different functional forms of\(f(\mathcal {R},T^2)\)gravity model to examine the impact of this modified framework in the evolution of the universe. Furthermore, we consider a specific scale factor to investigate different cosmological parameters, analyzing the evolutionary behavior of the universe in this gravity. We also perform stability analysis using the perturbation technique. Our findings indicate that the null energy condition violates at the bounce point and equation of state parameter exhibits characteristics of a quintessence era or phantom regimes. These aspects highlight the complex interplay between energy conditions and stability in bouncing cosmological model. We conclude that the\(f(\mathcal {R},T^2)\)theory successfully provides viable alternatives to the standard cosmological scenarios, offering insights into the early universe and the nature of gravity.In a dimensionless multi-scalar extension of the Standard Model, Gildener and Weinberg assumed that along a flat direction, there is only one classically massless scalar, known as thescalon, which acquires mass through radiative corrections à la Coleman–Weinberg, while all other scalars remain heavy. In this paper, by introducing a toy model with four scalar degrees of freedom we demonstrate the existence oftwoscalons along a specific flat direction that we construct. We present the effective potential for the model and provide the masses of the heavy scalars and two radiatively light pseudo-Goldstone bosons.In this work, we construct charged AdS black holes with a global monopole charge in diverse dimensions and study the thermodynamics. We find a critical monopole charge below which the solution exhibits Van-der Waals like behaviors. In the context of holography, this could be interpreted using the boundary degrees of freedoms. As an example, we study the phase diagram in the four dimensions analytically. We further analyze the microstructures of the solution using Ruppeiner geometry. We find that repulsive interactions dominates for black holes in a wide range of temperatures. However, around the critical point, attractive interactions is dominant and the Ruppeiner scalar curvature shows universal behaviors: it has a critical exponent 2 and coefficient\(-1/8\)in diverse dimensions. Universality of the results is interpreted from the scaling behavior of free energy near the critical point for Van-der Waals like fluids.Dating the ages and weighting the stellar populations in galaxies are essential steps when studying galaxy formation through cosmic times. Evolutionary population synthesis models with different input physics are used for this purpose. Moreover, the contribution from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stellar phase, which peaks for intermediate-age 0.6–2 Gyr systems, has been debated for decades. Here we report the detection of strong cool-star signatures in the rest-frame near-infrared spectra of three young (~1 Gyr), massive (~1010M⊙) quiescent galaxies at large look-back time,z= 1–2, using JWST/NIRSpec. The coexistence of oxygen- and carbon-type absorption features, spectral edges and features from rare species, such as vanadium and possibly zirconium, reveal a strong contribution from TP-AGB stars. Population synthesis models with a significant TP-AGB contribution reproduce the observations better than those with a weak TP-AGB, which are commonly used. These findings call for revisions of published stellar population fitting results, as they point to populations with lower masses and younger ages and have further implications for cosmic dust production and chemical enrichment. New generations of improved models are needed, informed by these and future observations.We derive the equation governing the axial-perturbations in the space-time of a non-rotating uncharged primordial black hole (PBH), produced in early Universe, whose metric has been taken as the generalized McVittie metric. The generalized McVittie metric is a cosmological black hole metric, proposed by Faraoni and Jacques in 2007 (Phys. Rev. D 76:063510, 2007). This describes the space-time of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in FLRW-Universe, while allowing its mass-change. Our derivation has basic similarities with the procedure of derivation of Chandrasekhar, for deriving the Regge-Wheeler equation for Schwarzschild metric (Chandrasekhar The Mathematical Theory of Black holes, Oxford University Press, New York, 1983); but it has some distinct differences with that due to the complexity and time-dependency of the generalized McVittie metric. We show that after applying some approximations which are very well valid in the early radiation-dominated Universe, the overall equation governing the axial perturbations can be separated into radial and angular parts, among which the radial part is the intended one, as the angular part is identical to the case of Schwarzschild metric as expected. We identify the potential from the Schrödinger-like format of the equation and draw some physical interpretation from it.Using an extended theory of General Relativity that incorporates normalized relativistic velocities, where the boundary terms in the varied Einstein–Hilbert action are considered. Within this context, I investigate the dynamic evolution of a collapsing spherical system characterized by a metric with spatial curvature and variable time-scale, aiming to describe the process of Gravastar formation. To illustrate the system’s dynamics, I analyze a power-law collapsing scenario and derive the equation of state for both cases, with and without geometrical perturbations. In particular, I derive the equation of state, incorporating back-reaction effects related with the boundary terms of the varied Einstein–Hilbert action.The Fourier harmonics,\(v_2\)and\(v_3\)of negative pions are measured at center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of\(\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}\)= 17.3 GeV around midrapidity by the CERES/NA45 experiment at the CERN SPS in 0–30% central PbAu collisions with a mean centrality of 5.5%. The analysis is performed in two centrality bins as a function of the transverse momentum\(\mathrm {p_{\textrm{T}}}\)from 0.05 GeV/cto more than 2 GeV/c. This is the first measurement of the\(v^{1/3}_{3}/v^{1/2}_{2}\)ratio as a function of transverse momentum at SPS energies, that reveals, independently of the hydrodynamic models, hydrodynamic behavior of the formed system. For\(\mathrm {p_{\textrm{T}}}\)above 0.5 GeV/c, the ratio is nearly flat in accordance with the hydrodynamic prediction and as previously observed by the ATLAS and ALICE experiments at the much higher LHC energies. The results are also compared with the SMASH-vHLLE hybrid model predictions, as well as with the SMASH model applied alone.In this paper, we have presented a power law cosmological model and its dynamical system analysis in\(f(T,\phi )\)gravity, whereTis the torsion scalar and\(\phi \)is the canonical scalar field. The two well-motivated forms of the non-minimal coupling function\(F(\phi )\), the exponential form and the power law form, with exponential scalar field potential, are investigated. The dynamical system analysis is performed by establishing the dimensionless dynamical variables, and the critical points were obtained. The evolution of standard density parameters is analysed for each case. The behaviour of the equation of state (EoS) and deceleration parameter agree with the result of recent cosmological observations. The model parameters are constrained using the existence and the stability conditions of the critical points describing different epochs of the evolution of the Universe.One of the strongest tools to verify the predictions of general relativity (GR) has been the gravitational lensing around various compact objects. Using a dual charged stringy black hole produced from dilaton-Maxwell gravity, we investigate the impact of the plasma parameter on gravitational lensing and black hole shadow in this study. Detailed investigations are performed to mark the impact of the homogeneous and non-homogeneous plasma environment on the electric and magnetic charge parameters of stringy black hole. In order to compare the results, we have also considered the vacuum scenario of the dual charged stringy black hole. Our results show that the effect of homogeneous plasma environment is much stronger in comparison to vacuum for the case of electrically charged stringy black hole. However, in the case of magnetically charged stringy black hole, the deflection angle gets decreased in presence of the homogeneous plasma medium. It has been observed that the radius of the shadow increases in a non-homogeneous plasma environment for electrically charged stringy black hole, whereas it decreases for magnetically charged stringy black hole in presence of the same plasma environment. This study aims to investigate how different plasma environments influence these fascinating astrophysical phenomena.We study a particular Einstein–Maxwell–Dilaton black hole configuration with cosmological constant, expressed in terms of the curvature radius, from the point of view of quasi-homogeneous thermodynamics. In particular, we show that the curvature radius and the coupling constant of the matter fields can be treated as thermodynamic variables in the framework of extended thermodynamics, leading in both cases to a van der Waals-like behavior. We also investigate in detail the stability and critical properties of the black holes and obtain results, which are compatible with the mean field approach.We develop a formalism of poly-vector deformations for Type IIB backgrounds with a block diagonal metric and non-vanishing self-dual 5-form RR field strength. Making use of the embedding of the Type IIB theory into the\(\textrm{E}_{6(6)}\)exceptional field theory we derive explicit transformation rules for four-vector deformations. We prove that the algebraic condition following from the Type IIB realization of exceptional Drinfeld algebras is sufficient for the transformation to generate a solution.We investigate the properties of compact objects in thef(Q,T) theory, where\(\mathcal {Q}\)is the non-metricity scalar and\({ \mathcal {T}}\)is the trace of the energy–momentum tensor. We derive an interior analytical solution for anisotropic perfect-fluid spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium using the linear form of\(f(\mathcal {Q}, { \mathcal {T}})=\mathcal {Q}+\psi { \mathcal {T}}\), where\(\psi \)represents a dimensional parameter. Based on the observational constraints related to the mass and radius of the pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021,\(\psi \)is set to a maximum negative value of\(\psi _1=\psi / \kappa ^2=-0.04\), where\(\kappa ^2\)is the gravitational coupling constant. The solution results in a stable compact object, which does not violate the speed of sound condition\(c_s^2\le \frac{c^2}{3}\). The effective equation of state is similar to the quark matter equation of state, and involves the presence of an effective bag constant. When\(\psi \)is negative, the star has a slightly larger size as compared to GR stars with the same mass. The difference in the predicted star size between the theory with a negative\(\psi \)and GR for the same mass is attributed to an additional force appearing in the hydrodynamic equilibrium equation. The maximum compactness allowed by the strong energy condition for\(f(\mathcal {Q}, { \mathcal {T}})\)theory and for GR is\(C = 0.514\)and 0.419, respectively, with the\(f(\mathcal {Q}, { \mathcal {T}})\)prediction about\(10\%\)higher than the GR one. Assuming a surface density at saturation nuclear density of\(\rho _{\text {nuc}} = 4\times 10^{14}~\hbox {g}/\hbox {cm}^3\), the maximum mass of the star is\(4.66 M_\odot \), with a radius of 14.9 km.We study the prospect of heavy singlet neutrinos as a dark matter (DM) candidate within a neutrinophilicU(1) model, where the Standard Model (SM) is extended with aU(1) gauge symmetry, and neutrino mass and oscillation parameters are explained through an inverse see-saw mechanism. The lightest of the heavy neutrinos plays the role of the DM, while the newly introduced scalars and the extra gauge boson\(Z'\)act as mediators between the dark sector and the SM sector. We show the range of model parameters where this DM candidate can be accommodated in the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) or Feebly Interacting Massive Particle (FIMP) scenario. The observed DM relic density (DMRD) is achieved via the new gauge boson and singlet scalar portals in the WIMP scenario, whereas within the FIMP scenario, these two particles assume a distinct yet pivotal role in generating the observed DMRD.The geometric trinity of gravity comprises three distinct formulations of general relativity: (i) the standard formulation describing gravity in terms of spacetime curvature, (ii) the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity describing gravity in terms of spacetime torsion, and (iii) the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (STEGR) describing gravity in terms of spacetime non-metricity. In this article, we complete a geometric trinity of non-relativistic gravity, by (a) taking the non-relativistic limit of STEGR to determine its non-relativistic analogue, and (b) demonstrating that this non-metric theory is equivalent to Newton–Cartan theory and its teleparallel equivalent, i.e., the curvature and the torsion based non-relativistic theories that are both geometrised versions of classical Newtonian gravity.AbstractBased on the results of several articles devoted to the study of the average power spectra (<PDS>) of γ-ray bursts (GRBs), a list of <PDS> features has been compiled that need to be explained. Using the possibility, proven in a number of publications, of decomposing the time profile of each γ-ray burst into the sum of several two-sided pulses, GRB modeling is performed in the time domain and the study of the average power spectra of models is carried out in the frequency domain. Brief reviews of the results of a number of theoretical works are made. A Monte Carlo simulation of time series consisting of a set of two-sided pulses with a Poisson distribution of the position of the pulses on the time scale, with different pulse shapes and distributions of amplitude and pulse duration, was carried out. All the basic properties of the average power spectrum in the form of a quasi-Lorentzian theoretically derived in various published studies have been confirmed. <PDS> of superposition of two-sided pulses randomly distributed over time are not described by a single power law. In general, the <PDS> shape consists of three quasi-power sections separated by two breaks. The position of the two breaks in the <PDS> is determined by the parameters of asymmetry and the effective pulse duration. The pulse-duration distribution and their shape affect the shape of the <PDS>, and the pulse amplitude distribution has practically no such effect. The amount of intermittency (at large values of γ ≥ 1) affects the shape of the <PDS>. Based on previous theoretical work and the Monte Carlo simulations carried out in this study, it can be argued that all the features of the average power spectra of GRBs are explained using a simple light curve model in the form of a superposition of uncorrelated random two-sided pulses. The main features of the <PDS> of GRBs are determined only by such pulse characteristics as the asymmetry parameter, the duration distribution, and the shape of the pulses.AbstractWe consider the planar circular restricted four-body problem. A small body of negligible mass moves in the Newtonian gravitational field of three attracting massive bodies (primaries). The primaries are located at the triangular libration points of a plane circular restricted three-body problem, i.e. they move in circular orbits and form an equilateral triangle. All four bodies move in a plane. It is assumed the stability of these triangular libration points are stable, that is the Routh’s necessary stability condition is fulfilled. The equations of motion of the planar restricted circular four-body problem admit particular solutions describing the so-called central configurations, in which all four bodies form a quadrilateral of constant form and size. If the Routh’s necessary stability condition is satisfied, then eight central configurations are possible, of which three can be stable in the linear approximation. By using the method of normal form and KAM theory, we performed nonlinear analysis of the stability of these central configurations. A numerical analysis of the coefficients of the Hamiltonian normal form of the equations of perturbed motion was performed and rigorous conclusions about stability were obtained. In the limiting case, when one of the three attracting bodies is small, analytical expressions for the coefficients of the Hamiltonian normal form were obtained by using method of the small parameter. It is shown that the results of analytical and numerical stability studies are in good agreement.We consider a counter-rotating torus orbiting a central Kerr black hole (BH) with dimensionless spina, and its accretion flow into theBH, in an agglomerate of an outer counter-rotating torus and an inner co-rotating torus. This work focus is the analysis of the inter-disks inversion surfaces. Inversion surfaces are spacetime surfaces, defined by the condition\(u^{\phi }=0\)on the flow torodial velocity, located out of theBHergoregion, and totally embedding theBH. They emerge as a necessary condition, related to the spacetime frame-dragging, for the counter-rotating flows into the central KerrBH. In our analysis we study the inversion surfaces of the Kerr spacetimes for the counter-rotating flow from the outer torus, impacting on the inner co-rotating disk. Being totally or partially embedded in (internal to) the inversion surfaces, the inner co-rotating torus (or jet) could be totally or in part “shielded”, respectively, from the impact with flow with\(a u^{\phi }<0\). We prove that, in general, in the spacetimes with\(a<0.551\)the co-rotating toroids are always external to the accretion flows inversion surfaces. For\(0.551<a<0.886\), co-rotating toroids could be partially internal (with the disk inner region, including the inner edge) in the flow inversion surface. ForBHswith\(a>0.886\), a co-rotating torus could be entirely embedded in the inversion surface and, for larger spins, it is internal to the inversion surfaces. Tori orbiting in theBHouter ergoregion are a particular case. Further constraints on theBHsspins are discussed in the article.The effects of cosmological expansion on quantum bosonic states are investigated, using quantum information theory. In particular, a generic Bogoliubov transformation of bosonic field modes is considered and the state change on a single mode is regarded as the effect of a quantum channel. Properties and capacities of this channel are thus explored in the framework off(Q) non-metric gravity. The reason is that non-metric gravity can be considered under the standard of gauge theories with all the advantages of such a formulation. As immediate result, we obtain that the information on a single-mode state appears better preserved, whenever the number of particles produced by the cosmological expansion is small. Specifically, we investigate a power lawf(Q) model, leaving unaltered the effective gravitational coupling, and minimise the corresponding particle production. We thus show how to optimise the preservation of classical and quantum information, stored in bosonic mode states in the remote past. Finally, we compare our findings with those obtained in General Relativity.The propagation speed of gravitational waves is a fundamental issue in gravitational theory. According to general relativity, gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light. However, alternative theories of gravity propose modifications to general relativity, including variations in the speed of gravitational waves. In this paper, we investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves that propagate at speeds different from the speed of light. First, we analytically calculate the power spectrum of scalar induced gravitational waves based on the speed and spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations. We then explore several scalar power spectra, deriving corresponding fractional energy densities, including monochromatic spectrum, scale-invariant spectrum, and power-law spectrum. Finally, we constrain scalar-induced gravitational waves and evaluate the signatures of their speed from the combination of CMB+BAO and gravitational wave observations. Our numerical results clearly illustrate the influence of the speed of scalar-induced gravitational waves.We present a fully automated implementation of next-to-leading order electroweak (NLO EW) corrections in the logarithmic approximation in OpenLoops. For energies above the electroweak scale NLO EW corrections are logarithmically enhanced and in tails of kinematic distributions of crucial LHC processes yield correction factors of several tens of percent. The implementation of the logarithmic Sudakov EW approximation in the amplitude generator OpenLoops is fully general, largely model independent, it supports the computation of EW corrections to resonant processes, and it is suitable for extensions to the two-loop NNLO EW level. The implementation is based on an efficient representation of the logarithmic approximation in terms of an effective vertex approach. Investigating a set of representative LHC processes we find excellent agreement between the logarithmic approximation and full one-loop results in observables where the assumptions of the EW Sudakov approximation are fulfilled.The connection between the equivalence principle and Noether’s theorem was discussed in Capozziello and Ferrara (Int J Geom Methods Mod Phys 21:2440014, 2024). However, it is known that the Noether symmetry condition is independent of the equations of motions as follows from Hamilton’s principle. In this paper, we critically examine the analysis presented in the aforementioned work, highlighting its flaws, and provide a detailed demonstration that there is no connection between Noether’s theorem and the equivalence principle. Furthermore, we offer various insights on symmetry analysis to prevent the perpetuation of inaccuracies regarding Noether’s work.Slipping motions of magnetic field lines are a distinct signature of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection, a fundamental process driving solar and stellar flares. While being a key prediction of numerical experiments, the rapid super-Alfvénic field line slippage driven by the ‘slip-running’ reconnection has remained elusive in previous observations. New frontiers into exploring transient flare phenomena were introduced by recently designed high cadence observing programs of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). By exploiting high temporal resolution imagery (~2 s) of IRIS, here we reveal slipping motions of flare kernels at speeds reaching thousands of kilometres per second. The fast kernel motions are direct evidence of slip-running reconnection in quasi-separatrix layers, regions where magnetic field strongly changes its connectivity. Our results provide observational proof of theoretical predictions unaddressed for nearly two decades and extend the range of magnetic field configurations where reconnection-related phenomena can occur.AbstractIn this paper, expressions for high-precision simulation of multi-GNSS observations received in low Earth orbit are given. Based on this observation model, the real spacecraft orbit was refined. Based on real data from the GRACE space project, the results were compared with simulated measurements from foreign software. The average deviation in determining the spacecraft location was 18 mm, which confirms the correctness of the described observation model.AbstractOn October 9, 2022, orbiting X-ray and γ-ray telescopes registered the most powerful explosion ever observed in the Universe—the GRB221009A γ-ray burst at a distance of 2.4 billion light years. The response of the Earth’s ionosphere to this unique event was detected in the received signals of very-low-frequency (VLF) radio paths passing through both the daytime and nighttime ionosphere. A disturbance in the night sector was observed as a sudden decrease in amplitude up to 7 dB and a sharp jump in the signal phase up to 20°‒30°. Less pronounced amplitude jumps up to 1.5 dB were found in the daytime sector. At the time of the flare, magnetometers showed only the appearance of a weak burst of the geomagnetic field ∼0.5 nT at the time of the flare. In the daytime, an isolated geomagnetic pulse with an amplitude of up to 1 nT was observed. The appearance of a geomagnetic response to a γ-ray flare is surprising, because its radiation creates additional ionization in the stratosphere, significantly below the conducting E-layer of the ionosphere. The recorded event showed that extragalactic γ-ray bursts cause a noticeable perturbation in the Earth’s ionosphere, and the network of VLF radio paths covering the lower ionosphere can be considered as a giant γ-ray detector.AbstractWhen solving the problems of dynamics in space of EP’s plasma jets, it is necessary to take into account the influence of the Earth’s magnetic field on the formation of a plasma stream (EP-electric propulsion). It is shown that under the influence of a geomagnetic field, plasma jets acquire specific three—dimensional shapes at some distance from the source, biconvex plasma petals—“corsunoids.” The strength of such influence is determined by a parameter of electromagnetic interaction—the Ampere parameter equal to a scale of the ratio of a transverse electromagnetic force to a pressure gradient.AbstractThe paper proposes a method for constructing trajectories for launching a spacecraft into a circular polar orbit of an artificial Moon satellite (AMS) based on the use of the properties of invariant manifolds of solutions to the circular restricted three-body problem. This approach, in comparison with the classical Hohmann transfer, makes it possible to significantly reduce the braking impulse by increasing the flight time. The process of constructing flight orbits includes two stages. At the first stage, solutions to the circular restricted three-body problem are analyzed, as a result of which the least costly options for entering the AMS orbit are selected. At the second stage, orbits corresponding to the found options and passing at a given distance from the Earth are constructed in the ephemeris model of the Solar System. The developed method was applied to analyze the possibilities of flights to polar orbits of the AMS with an altitude of 150 km in 2030. Options for entering the orbit of the AMS are described corresponding to the braking impulse values of 619.5 and 623.3 m/s with a flight duration of 111 days and 93 days, respectively.AbstractThe paper formulates a methodology for reducing the general problem of optimal spacecraft control to a problem of reinforcement machine learning. The methodology includes a method for assessing the quality of a control algorithm based on probability theory inequalities. An author’s software toolbox is presented for reducing optimal control problems to reinforcement learning. Two examples of application of the methodology are considered. The proposed technique may also be of interest for general mechanical systems control design.AbstractThe article presents the results of an experimental study of the strength properties of samples obtained by laser melting from powder compositions of a lunar regolith simulant based on gabbro-diabase. The powder compositions have been obtained by sieving with a fraction range of 50–100 and 100–140 μm from a simulant with a grain-size distribution similar to that of natural regolith. Their properties have been studied on experimental samples with characteristic dimensions of 7.5 × 5 × 6 mm3: apparent density, hardness, and compressive strength in different melting modes. Dependences of these properties on the energy density were obtained in the range from 12 to 25 J/mm3. The measured Vickers hardness of samples fused from a composition of 50–100 μm had a range of 691–830HV, and samples from a composition of 100–140 μm had a wider range: 330–830HV. The maximum values of compressive strength for samples from both compositions reached 17–20 MPa with median values of 12 and 17 MPa for the first and second compositions, respectively. These values are quite consistent with those that could be obtained by the process of in situ resource utilization.AbstractThe article presents the results of an experimental study of the strength properties of samples obtained by laser melting from powder compositions of a lunar regolith simulant based on gabbro-diabase.

The results of numerical modeling (CUSTEP/Biovia Materials Studio) and experimental studies using the FT-801 IR Fourier spectrometer with a plug-in using the method of disturbed internal reflection (Simex, Novosibirsk) are presented. Numerical calculations have shown that forsterite can contain hydroxyl groups –OH(D) in its crystal lattice under certain conditions. The possibility of retaining various isotopic forms of molecular water on the surface of forsterite has been experimentally verified and the corresponding IR spectra of the mineral with a water film have been obtained. The IR spectra of forsterite containing isotopologues of water obtained theoretically and experimentally are compared with the observations of theChandrayaan-1andSOFIAartificial lunar satellites.AbstractThe paper presents the results of laboratory tests of selective laser melting (SLM) of powder compositions of lunar regolith simulants from the terrestrial rocks of gabbro-diabase and labradorite, which have different ranges of fractionality. It is shown that compositions with narrow ranges of fractionality of either 50–100 or 100–140 μm make it possible to produce the samples with rather good properties: relatively low porosity and rather good compliance with the requested geometric shape. Experimental dependences of the porosity of tested samples on the energy density of melting are obtained. For both cases of powder compositions from gabbro-diabase with the narrow fractions, either 50–100 or 100–140 μm, the dependences on the energy are practically the same: with increasing energy density up to 20 J/mm3and greater, the porosity approaches 30–35%. On the other hand, experimental tests shown that SLM technology for a powder composition with a broad range of fractions, from 0 to 100 μm, does not allow testing samples with acceptable properties to be produced—either with low porosity and with reasonable consistency with the specified geometry.AbstractThe correction of the trajectory of a two-impulse launch of a spacecraft into a high circular orbit of an artificial Moon satellite is considered, taking into account errors in determining the position and speed of the satellite, as well as errors in issuing speed impulses in magnitude and direction. Trajectory corrections with one and two correction impulses are considered. Results of analysis are presented. Conclusions are drawn about the practical application of such trajectories.Abstract3U CubeSat stabilization towards the Sun is analyzed. The satellite is equipped with solar telescope of the vacuum ultraviolet spectrum. Stabilization of the optical axis of the telescope is achieved through the use of either reaction wheels or magnetorquers. The desired level of stabilization accuracy is set at two angular minutes per second. Performance of both control systems is compared on a Sun synchronous orbit. The study formulates the necessary operational conditions for the satellite’s successful functioning and establishes the key parameters of its control systems.In this paper, we explore the application of Kerr/CFT correspondence to the accelerating Kerr–Taub–NUT spacetime. We demonstrate that the correspondence can be maintained if the near-horizon angular coordinate is appropriately rescaled. This rescaling allows the Cardy formula to accurately reproduce the extremal Bekenstein–Hawking entropy, a departure from the typical direct recovery of extremal Bekenstein–Hawking temperature in Kerr/CFT literature. This discrepancy is attributed to the presence of multiple sources of conic singularity in the spacetime, specifically the acceleration and NUT parameters. To support the Kerr/CFT holography, we investigate the hidden conformal symmetry in the near-horizon region of the extremal black hole geometry. Our findings confirm that the angular coordinate rescaling does not introduce inconsistencies within the Kerr/CFT framework, as evidenced by the preserved hidden conformal symmetry and consistent entropy matching calculations in the near-horizon geometry of the extremal accelerating Kerr–Taub–NUT black hole.We consider the bending of light around a compact astrophysical object with both the electric field and the magnetic field in Einstein–Born–Infeld theory. From the null geodesic of a light ray passing a massive object with electric charge and magnetic dipole, the effective metric was obtained from the light cone condition reflecting the nonlinear electromagnetic effects. We found the asymptotic form of the effective metric up to the first order in gravitational constantGand Born–Infeld parameter\(1/\beta ^2\)on the equatorial plane. Then we compute the bending angle of light from the geodesic equation. The result includes particular cases where only one type of field is present taking the appropriate limits.We examine the accretion process in a thin disk surrounding a supermassive black hole within the framework of Einstein–Maxwell-scalar (EMS) gravity. Our investigation aims to elucidate how variations in model parameters affect different physical properties of the disk. When keeping EMS parameters\(\beta \)andqconstant, we observe a reduction in radiation flux and temperature as\(\alpha \)increases. However, the luminosity and radiative efficiency exhibit relatively minor variation. Conversely, under fixed\(\alpha \)andq, an escalation in\(\beta \)leads to heightened levels of radiation flux, temperature, luminosity, and radiative efficiency. These results underscore the diverse influences of model parameters on observable metrics, providing valuable insights for the astronomical study of distinct black holes.We investigate the inclusive production of fully charmed tetraquarks,\(T_{4c}(0^{++})\)or\(T_{4c}(2^{++})\)radial excitations, in high-energy proton collisions. We build our study upon the collinear fragmentation of a single parton in a variable-flavor number scheme, suited to describe the tetraquark formation mechanism from moderate to large transverse-momentum regimes. To this extent, we derive a novel set of DGLAP-evolving collinear fragmentation functions, namedTQ4Q1.0determinations. They encode initial-scale inputs corresponding to both gluon and heavy-quark fragmentation channels, defined within the context of quark-potential and spin-physics inspired models, respectively. We work within the NLL/\(\hbox {NLO}^+\)hybrid factorization and make use of theJETHADnumeric interface along with thesymJETHADsymbolic calculation plugin. With these tools, we provide predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to\(T_{4c}\)plus jet emissions at center-of-mass energies ranging from 14 TeV at the LHC to the 100 TeV nominal energy of the FCC.We compute the rate of change of mass and angular momentum of a black hole, namely tidal heating, in an eccentric orbit. The change is caused due to the tidal field of the orbiting companion. We compute the result for both the spinning and non-spinning black holes in the leading order of the mean motion, namely\(\xi \). We demonstrate that the rates get enhanced significantly for nonzero eccentricity. Since eccentricity in a binary evolves with time we also express the results in terms of an initial eccentricity and azimuthal frequency\(\xi _{\phi }\). In the process, we developed a prescription that can be used to compute all physical quantities in a series expansion of initial eccentricity,\(e_0\). These results are computed taking account of the spin of the binary components. The prescription can be used to compute very high-order corrections of initial eccentricity. We use it to find the contribution to eccentricity up to\({\mathcal {O}}(e_0^5)\)in the spinning binary. Using the computed expression of eccentricity, we derived the rate of change of mass and angular momentum of a black hole, both rotating and non-rotating, in terms of initial eccentricity and azimuthal frequency up to\({\mathcal {O}}(e_0^6)\). With the computed fluxes we also compute for the first time the leading order dephasing in both cases analytically up to\({\mathcal {O}}(e_0^6)\)and study its impact. We argue that for high signal-to-noise ratio sources, these contributions require inclusion in the waveform modeling.Both the Barrow and Tsallis\(\delta \)entropies are one-parameter generalizations of the black-hole entropy, with the same microcanonical functional form. The ensuing deformation is quantified by a dimensionless parameter\(\Delta \), which in the case of Barrow entropy represents the anomalous dimension caused by quantum fluctuations over the horizon surface, while in Tsallis’ case, it describes the deviation of the holographic scaling from extensivity. Here, we utilize the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture with the Barrow–Tsallis entropy to investigate the implications of the related modified Friedmann equations on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves. We show that, with the experimental sensitivity of the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, such as the Big Bang Observer, it will be possible to discriminate deviations from the\(\Lambda \)CDM model up to\(\Delta \lesssim \mathcal {O}(10^{-3})\). In this limit, Barrow–Tsallis entropy reduces to a logarithmic correction to holographic scaling, which is nearly universally predicted by both entanglement entropy calculations in the UV regime and by several candidate theories of quantum gravity. Hence, our considerations and results are expected to have general validity in the quantum gravity framework.This study explores the impact of introducing particle and future event horizon as infrared (IR) cutoff on (m,n)-type entropy corrected versions of pilgrim dark energy. We investigate (m,n)-type power-law entropy corrected pilgrim dark energy in a flat fractal platform by considering a non-interacting scenario with cold dark matter. Then, our focus shifts to (m,n)-type logarithmic entropy corrected pilgrim dark energy. We derive the evolution of some relevant cosmological parameters and cosmological planes. Finally, we constrain the model parameters using\(H(z)+\)BAO combined observational data from the DA and BAO methods. For statistical analysis, we apply the\(\chi ^2\)-minimization technique (equivalent to the maximum likelihood method) to estimate the best-fit value of the model parameters. We incorporate public Cosmo Hammer (EMCEE) Python package code to perform the MCMC method. Finally, we display the plot of cosmological parameters and cosmological plane and analyze the triangular contour plot by using the optimal values of the model parameters.Recently, a new generalized family of infinite-dimensional\( \widetilde{W} \)algebras, each associated with a particular element of a commutative subalgebra of the\( W_{1+\infty } \)algebra, was described. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the aforementioned association, accompanied by the requisite proofs and illustrative examples. This approach allows a derivation of Ward identities for selected WLZZ matrix models and the expansion of corresponding\( W \)-operators in terms of an infinite set of variables\( p_k \).The first measurement of the multiplicity dependence of intra-jet properties of leading charged-particle jets in proton–proton (pp) collisions is reported. The mean charged-particle multiplicity and jet fragmentation distributions are measured in minimum-bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions at center-of-mass energy\(\sqrt{s}\)= 13 TeV using the ALICE detector. Jets are reconstructed from charged particles produced in the midrapidity region (\(|\eta | < 0.9\)) using the sequential recombination anti-\(k_{\textrm{T}}\)algorithm with jet resolution parametersR= 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 for the transverse momentum (\(p_\textrm{T}\)) interval 5–110 GeV/c. The high-multiplicity events are selected by the forward V0 scintillator detectors. The mean charged-particle multiplicity inside the leading jet cone rises monotonically with increasing jet\(p_\textrm{T}\)in qualitative agreement with previous measurements at lower energies. The distributions of jet fragmentation function variables\(z^{\textrm{ch}}\)and\(\xi ^{\textrm{ch}}\)are measured for different jet-\(p_\textrm{T}\)intervals. Jet-\(p_\textrm{T}\)independent fragmentation of leading jets is observed for wider jets except at high- and low-\(z^{\textrm{ch}}\)values. The observed “hump-backed plateau” structure in the\(\xi ^{\textrm{ch}}\)distribution indicates suppression of low-\(p_\textrm{T}\)particles. In high-multiplicity events, an enhancement of the fragmentation probability of low-\(z^{\textrm{ch}}\)particles accompanied by a suppression of high-\(z^{\textrm{ch}}\)particles is observed compared to minimum-bias events. This behavior becomes more prominent for low-\(p_\textrm{T}\)jets with larger jet radius. The results are compared with predictions of QCD-inspired event generators, PYTHIA 8 with Monash 2013 tune and EPOS LHC. It is found that PYTHIA 8 qualitatively reproduces the jet modification in high-multiplicity events except at high jet\(p_\textrm{T}\). These measurements provide important constraints to models of jet fragmentation.The concepts of radiative and adiabatic equilibria, introduced by Karl Schwarzschild in his seminal paperUeber das Gleichgewicht der Sonnenatmosphärepublished in January 1906, are the founding blocks of the theory of radiative transfer, stellar structure, and solar physics. Careful reading of the paper and its later English translation reveals small formal inaccuracies and ambiguities but with no consequences whatsoever for the final outcomes and conclusions. This paper offers their adjustments with respective derivations using contemporary formalism and sets Schwarzschild’s paper in context with a historical and modern perspective. Particular attention is paid to Schwarzschild’s largely forgotten limb-darkening formula for adiabatic equilibrium. The paper also reproduces Schwarzschild’s radiative equilibrium protomodel of the Sun’s atmosphere in graphical form and compares it with modern models presented in some of the most cited papers in stellar and solar physics.The Moon’s farside South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin is the largest and oldest visible impact basin in the inner Solar System. Determining the timing of this catastrophic event is key to understanding the onset of the lunar basin-forming epoch, with implications for understanding the impact bombardment history of the inner Solar System. Despite this, the formation age of the SPA basin remains poorly constrained. Here we show that the chemical composition of the lunar meteorite Northwest Africa 2995 is in good agreement with lithologies exposed within the southern region of the SPA basin. Radiometric dating of a range of mineral and rock components in Northwest Africa 2995 yielded consistent dates of ~4.32–4.33 billion years old. We interpret these dates as the age of SPA basin formation, inferring that this event occurred ~120 million years before the formation of the main cluster of lunar impact basins between ~4.2 Ga and 3.8 Ga. This weakens support for a narrow period of lunar late heavy impact bombardment and also implies that the earliest formed impact basins on the Moon (that is, >4.33–4.5 Ga old) were erased either by the SPA impact itself when its formation caused massive resurfacing of the lunar surface or through other geological processes.In this study we demonstrate the application of the maximum entropy method (MEM) to determine the valence quark distribution of exotic hadrons. Our investigation yields three key findings. Firstly, we observe a significant shift towards smaller Bjorken scalexin the peak position of the valence quark distribution for hadrons with an increasing number of valence quarks, consistent with previous results by Kawamura and Kumano. Secondly, assuming that the\(Z_c(3900)\)initially consists of four valence quarks, we employ MEM to determine its initial valence quark distribution, estimating a radius of\(r_c=1.276\)fm at an extremely low resolution scale\(Q^2\). Furthermore, we identify a notable discrepancy between our computed charge form factor\(G_c(q)\)at leading order and the outcomes of hadron molecular state calculations. We propose that this form factor can be extracted from the QCD counting rule cross-section, which is grounded in generalized distribution amplitudes (GDA) linked to the multi-quark states.This article examines the cosmic evolution in the framework of symmetric teleparallel theory, characterized by the function of non-metricity scalar\((\mathcal {Q})\). We use the e-folding number and reconstruction method with a suitable parametrization of the scale factor to obtain the functional form of symmetric teleparallel theory. Using this reconstructed model, we examine the behavior of different cosmographic parameters to demonstrate the bouncing scenarios of the cosmos by considering the contraction and expansion phases of cosmos before and after the bouncing point, respectively. It is found that the null energy condition is violated which shows that the singularity issue can be resolved in this extended theoretical framework. Moreover, we observe that the acceleration occurs near the bouncing point and the reconstructed model aligns with the current cosmic expansion. Finally, we check the validity of second law of thermodynamics in the bouncing framework of our model.We consider a semi-classical approximation to the dynamics of a point particle in a noncommutative space. In this approximation, the noncommutativity of space coordinates is described by a Poisson bracket. For linear Poisson brackets, the corresponding phase space is given by the cotangent bundle of a Lie group, with the Lie group playing the role of a curved momentum space. We show that the curvature of the momentum space may lead to rather unexpected physical phenomena such as an upper bound on the velocity of a free nonrelativistic particle, bounded motion for repulsive central force, and no-fall-into-the-centre for attractive Coulomb potential. We also consider a superintegrable Hamiltonian for the Kepler problem in 3-space with\(\mathfrak {su}(2)\)noncommutativity. The leading correction to the equations of motion due to noncommutativity is shown to be described by an effective monopole potential.We study pseudoscalar\(\pi \),Kand\(\eta \)meson properties, such as masses and couplings, in dense matter at zero temperature. We use a recently proposed phenomenological quark model, known as the PNJL0, which takes into account the confinement/deconfinement phase transition by means of the traced Polyakov loop (\(\varPhi \)) which serves as an order parameter at zero temperature. We consider two different scenarios, namely, symmetric quark matter with equal chemical potentials for all the flavors, and the beta equilibrated matter. In the latter case the hadron-quark phase transition is implemented by a two model approach. For the hadron side we use a relativistic mean-field model with density dependent couplings. We show that\(\varPhi \)induces abrupt changes in the mesons properties with gap sizes regulated by the phenomenological gluonic sector of the model.AbstractBased on the successful landings of landing modules (LM) on the surface and the introduction of aerostat probes (AP) into the air, the feasibility of exploring Venus by an AP drifting in the cloud layer of its atmosphere using short-term descents and landings on its surface has been substantiated. Mathematical modeling was performed to confirm the feasibility of short-term AP drops with a scientific package (SP) in a thermostatted compartment for sampling soil, aerosols and gases and remote sensing (RS) in various regions remote from each other near the surface of the planet Venus for their analysis during a long drift at the height of the cloud layer. Using the example of individual SP devices for geochemical and geophysical studies of Venusian rocks, the scenario and capabilities of AP are shown, which significantly expand both the range of scientific tasks to be solved and the capabilities of the scientific equipment itself.AbstractWhen passing through the Earth’s atmosphere, cosmic bodies are subjected to significant loads due to the impact of high-speed gas flow on their surface. Under the influence of aerodynamic forces and strong heat flows, these bodies are destroyed. The mechanisms of destruction depend on their composition, structure, speed, size and strength. Artificial space bodies move in the atmosphere, generally maintaining their orientation in space, and reach the surface, maintaining integrity due to their high strength. As a result of surface destruction of the frontal part of these bodies, destruction products enter the plasma layer surrounding them when moving in the atmosphere. The design features of the Soyuz descent vehicle made it possible to study the dust component of the plasma layer from the deposits deposited on the porthole. Data on particles detected on the surface of the spacecraft are analyzed, and the results of a statistical analysis of the resulting particle size distribution are presented. It is shown that the distribution curve is well described by a power law.AbstractA method for determining the lines of variation (LOV) in the initial confidence region under strong nonlinearity in the orbit improvement problem is developed, based on finding the maximum modulus of the normal vector to the level surfaces of the objective function using the least-squares method. The method was tested for three asteroids using their observations on a short arc of the orbit, namely, the points of two variation lines corresponding to the directions of the greatest deformation of the initial confidence region were determined. Approximation of variation lines was performed using third-degree polynomials. Using the obtained approximations, new variables were introduced in which the initial confidence region is almost ellipsoidal, i.e., nonlinearity is nearly absent. The modeling of the initial probability dispersion of trajectories is performed in the space of new variables. The resulting dispersion can be further used to identify collision orbits and estimate the probability of asteroid collisions with Earth.AbstractThe paper describes the improvements made by the authors to the previously published Numerical Model of the Motion of Artificial Lunar Satellites (ALS). The results of a study of the dynamics of cislunar objects obtained by numerical modeling are presented. It is shown that the short lifespan of low-flying objects in orbits, revealed by a number of authors, is explained solely by the influence of the complex gravitational field of the Moon, primarily the radial component of the force acting on the satellites. The features of the influence of light pressure (LP) on cislunar objects are considered. It is shown that LP expands the range of action of apsidal-nodal resonances that arise in the movement of cislunar objects.In the present work, we study the initial moments of a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological model, considering Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) as the gravitational theory. The matter content of the model is a radiation perfect fluid. In order to study the initial moments of the universe in the present model, we consider quantum cosmology. More precisely the quantum mechanical tunneling mechanism. In that mechanism, the universe appears after the wavefunction associated to that universe tunnels through a potential barrier. We started studying the classical model. We draw the phase portrait of the model and identify qualitatively all types of dynamical behaviors associated to it. Then, we write the Hamiltonian of the model and apply the Dirac quantization procedure to quantize a constrained theory. We find the appropriate Wheeler-DeWitt equation and solve it using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. Using the WKB solution, to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, we compute the tunneling probabilities for the birth of that universe (\(TP_{WKB}\)). Since the WKB wavefunction depends on the radiation energy (E) and the free parameters coming from the HL theory (\(g_c\),\(g_r\),\(g_s\),\(g_\Lambda \)), we compute the behavior of\(TP_{WKB}\)as a function ofEand all the HL’s parameters\(g_c\),\(g_r\),\(g_s\),\(g_\Lambda \). As a new result, due to the HL theory, we notice that, in the present model, the universe cannot tunnel through the barrier close to the origin. It happens because that tunneling probability is nil. Therefore, here, the universe cannot starts from a zero size and is free from the big bang singularity.We propose an interpretation for the adjoint representation of theSO(32) group to classify the scalars of a generic Supersymmetric Standard Model having just three generations of particles, via a flavour groupSU(5). We show that this same interpretation arises from a simple postulate of self-consistence of composites for these scalars. The model looks only for colour and electric charge, and it pays the cost of an additional chiral\(+4/3\)quark per generation.In this paper, we compute departures in the black hole thermodynamics induced by either geometric or topological corrections to general relativity. Specifically, we analyze the spherically symmetric spacetime solutions of two modified gravity scenarios with Lagrangians\(\mathcal {L}\sim R^{1+\epsilon }\)and\(\mathcal {L}\sim R+\epsilon \, \mathcal {G}^2\), where\(\mathcal {G}\)is the Euler density in four dimensions, while\( 0<\epsilon \ll 1\)measures the perturbation around the Hilbert–Einstein action. Accordingly, we find the expressions of the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy by the Penrose formula, and the black hole temperature and horizon of the obtained solutions. We then investigate the heat capacities in terms of the free parameters of the theories under study. In doing so, we show that healing the problem of negative heat capacities can be possible under particular choices of the free constants, albeit with limitations on the masses allowed for the black hole solutions.Using proton–proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\(140\hbox { fb}^{-1}\)collected by the CMS experiment at\(\sqrt{s}= 13\,\text {Te}\hspace{-.08em}\text {V} \), the\({{{\Lambda }} _{\text {b}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\text {J}/\uppsi }} {{{\Xi }} ^{{-}}} {{\text {K}} ^{{+}}} \)decay is observed for the first time, with a statistical significance exceeding 5 standard deviations. The relative branching fraction, with respect to the\({{{\Lambda }} _{\text {b}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{{\uppsi }} ({2\textrm{S}})} {{\Lambda }} \)decay, is measured to be\(\mathcal {B}({{{\Lambda }} _{\text {b}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\text {J}/\uppsi }} {{{\Xi }} ^{{-}}} {{\text {K}} ^{{+}}} )/\mathcal {B}({{{\Lambda }} _{\text {b}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{{\uppsi }} ({2\textrm{S}})} {{\Lambda }} ) = [3.38\pm 1.02\pm 0.61\pm 0.03]\%\), where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is related to the uncertainties in\(\mathcal {B}({{{\uppsi }} ({2\textrm{S}})} \rightarrow {{\text {J}/\uppsi }} {{{\uppi }} ^{{+}}} {{{\uppi }} ^{{-}}} )\)and\(\mathcal {B}({{{\Xi }} ^{{-}}} \rightarrow {{\Lambda }} {{{\uppi }} ^{{-}}} )\).Bianchi cosmologies are “natural” anisotropic extensions of the Friedmann universes and they have long been used to investigate the cosmological implications of anisotropy. The latter introduces new ingredients to the standard scenarios, although there are physical processes and effects that maintain their basic Friedmann features when extended to Bianchi universes. Here, we assume a perturbed Bianchi model and look into the implications of the observers’ peculiar flow for their measurement and their interpretation of the deceleration parameter. Our motivation is twofold. To begin with, relative motions have long been known to deceive the observers by “contaminating” the observations, which also still suffer from sample limitations that cloud the statistical significance of the findings. Further motivation comes from claims that observers in bulk flows that expand slightly slower than their surroundings can have the illusion of cosmic acceleration in a universe that is actually decelerating. The claim was originally based on studies of a perturbed tilted Einstein–de Sitter model, but persisted when the background cosmology was replaced by any of the three Friedmann universes. This raised the possibility that the peculiar-motion effect on the deceleration parameter may be generic and largely independent of the host spacetime. Here, we investigate this possibility by extending the earlier studies to perturbed Bianchi models. We find that the Friedmann picture remains unchanged, unless the Bianchi background has unrealistically high anisotropy. The bulk-flow observers can still be misled to the illusion of accelerated expansion by their own peculiar motion.AbstractThe degassing of basic silicate minerals (olivines, pyroxenes, plagioclases) that make up mantle rocks similar in chemical composition to lunar mare basalts has been studied. A setup specially designed for these tasks was used, previously used in the study of chondrite degassing. The results of experimental studies on stepwise heating (without accumulation) with determination of the composition of released gases using gas chromatography methods in the temperature range from 200 to 1000°C are presented. The composition of the released gases was compared with the fugacity of oxygen in olivines. Raman and IR spectra of both the original minerals and minerals after isothermal annealing at various temperatures were obtained. Based on them, the course of thermal transformation of the crystalline structure of minerals was traced and estimates of their stability were obtained. The composition of silicate minerals was compared with samples of lunar soil delivered by the Chinese space missionChang’e-5.AbstractIn the period December 12, 2022, to February 28, 2023, we performed a series ofUBVRIobservations of 65 asteroids, including 50 primitive-type objects, which could be observed near perihelion at that time, and calculated their approximated reflectance spectra. The observations were aimed at searching for spectral signs of sublimation-driven dust activity in the asteroids and formation of a transient dust exosphere, which are caused by the presence of Н2О ice in their interior and the highest subsolar temperature. Based on the analysis of the accuracy and shape of approximated reflectance spectra of the primitive-type asteroids, a set of which was conventionally restricted by the geometric albedo value not exceeding 0.10, we found sublimation-driven dust activity in asteroids 164 Eva, 360 Carlova, and 750 Oskar by distinct short-term variations in the reflectance of these asteroids in theUband. During one of the nights, similar spectral changes and sublimation-driven dust activity related to them were detected in asteroid 629 Bernardina; the geometric albedo of this asteroid is somewhat higher (0.14 or 0.19), which may be indicative of a heterogeneous composition of its material and, apparently, a local outcropping of water ice on its surface. Moreover, in three asteroids of a high-temperature type, 757 Portlandia, 1121 Natascha, and 1687 Glarona, noticeable variations were detected in the entire spectral range; they may be connected with ejection of submicron dust particles from the surface by some other mechanisms. To substantiate and interpret the results of observations, we numerically modeled the reflectance spectra of conditional asteroids of taxonomic types C and S (with low- and high-temperature mineralogy, respectively), which are enveloped by an optically thin dust exosphere containing aggregate or homogeneous submicron particles of different composition. On the basis of this modeling, we introduce a quantitative criterion to identify a weak sublimation-driven dust activity in primitive-type asteroids in the visible range.AbstractThe paper propose the method for solving the Euler–Lambert problem proposed by V.A. Egorov and based on the works by D.E. Okhotsimsky, devoted to the analysis of a set of flight trajectories between two given points in the central Newtonian field. When considering the Euler–Lambert problem as the inverse problem of ballistics (dynamics), we have succeeded in developing a new effective method for determining the orbit corresponding to a given flight time. It is logical to name this approach the Okhotsimsky–Egorov method. In the considered approach, the parameter of the set of flights is the initial flight-path angle. The advantages of the proposed method are the limited and understandable structure of the domain of definition of solutions, the simplicity and clarity of the algorithm, and the clear dependence of the solution on the initial velocity. It enables a qualitative analysis of flight trajectories and the construction of effective numerical methods. To solve the Euler–Lambert problem Halley’s numerical method was used. A computational complexity analysis of considered algorithm was carried out and demonstrated its high efficiency.AbstractThe aim of this paper is to investigate the motion properties of the infinitesimal body under the effects of gravitational forces, the quantum correction, variable mass, modified Newtonian force, interaction between bodies, triaxial parameters, Coriolis and centrifugal forces in the restricted three-body configuration. Using Jeans law, Meshcherskii space-time transformations and the above perturbations, we evaluate the equations of motion and quasi-Jacobian integral. And then, we numerically illustrate the locations of equilibrium points, regions of motion, Poincare surfaces of section, basins of attraction, periodic orbits and stability of the equilibrium points.We construct new supersymmetric Janus solutions from four-dimensional\(N=3\)gauged supergravity coupled to eight vector multiplets with\(SO(3)\times SU(3)\)gauge group. This gauged supergravity admits a supersymmetric\(N=3\)\(AdS_4\)vacuum with the full\(SO(3)\times SU(3)\)symmetry unbroken and a family of supersymmetric\(N=1,2,3\)and non-supersymmetric\(AdS_4\)vacua with different residual symmetries. These are expected to be dual to supersymmetric Chern–Simons–Matter (CSM) theories in three dimensions via the AdS/CFT correspondence. By considering a truncation to three complex scalar fields, we find a number of Janus solutions preserving\(N=1\)supersymmetry that describes conformal interfaces within\(N=3\)CSM theories with\(SO(3)\times SU(3)\)and\(SU(2)_{\text {diag}}\times U(1)\)symmetries.In this work, we have formulated a new class of traversable wormhole metrics. Initially, we have considered a wormhole metric in which the temporal component is an exponential function ofrbut the spatial components of the metrics are fixed. Following that, we have again constructed a generalized wormhole metric in which the spatial component is an exponential function ofr, but the temporal component is fixed. Finally, we have considered the generalized wormhole metric in which both the temporal and spatial components are generalized exponential functions ofr. We have also studied some of their properties including throat radius, stability, and energy conditions, examined singularity, the metric in curvature coordinates, effective refractive index, innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and photon sphere, Regge–Wheeler potential and their quasinormal modes, gravitational entropy, and determined the curvature tensor. The radius of the throat is found to be consistent with the properties of wormholes and does not contain any types of singularities. Most interestingly, we find that their throat radius is the same for the same spatial component and the same range of values ofm. In addition to these, they also violate the Null Energy Condition (NEC) near the throat. These newly constructed metrics form a new class of traversable wormholes.The observation of the electroweak production of aWboson and a photon in association with two jets, usingppcollision data at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre of mass energy of\(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV, is reported. The data were recorded by the ATLAS experiment from 2015 to 2018 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb\(^{-1}\). This process is sensitive to the quartic gauge boson couplings via the vector boson scattering mechanism and provides a stringent test of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. Events are selected if they contain one electron or muon, missing transverse momentum, at least one photon, and two jets. Multivariate techniques are used to distinguish the electroweak\(W\gamma jj\)process from irreducible background processes. The observed significance of the electroweak\(W\gamma jj\)process is well above six standard deviations, compared to an expected significance of 6.3 standard deviations. Fiducial and differential cross sections are measured in a fiducial phase space close to the detector acceptance, which are in reasonable agreement with leading order Standard Model predictions fromMadGraph5+Pythia8andSherpa. The results are used to constrain new physics effects in the context of an effective field theory.In this work, we investigated an inhomogeneous spherically symmetric star consisting of dust fluid and dark energy components. We obtained similarity solutions for the energy density of the inhomogeneous dust fluid\(\rho (t,r)\), dark energy\(\rho _{DE}(t,r)\), and the mass function inside the starm(t,r). The symmetries of Einstein field equations for this model are derived using the symmetry group analysis method, where the Einstein field equations have been reduced into nonlinear ordinary differential equations (NODEs). Some interesting explicit analytical solutions are obtained for the reduced NODEs. Consequently, a new class of similarity solutions has been obtained for the energy density of the inhomogeneous dust fluid and dark energy as functions of coordinatestandr. These solutions are obtained when the star is composed of both dust fluid and dark energy components, dark energy components only, and dust fluid only. When the star is composed of dust fluid only, we discussed the possibility of black hole formation by assuming that the collapsing star is not initially trapped. Graphical representations of some solutions are given and discussed in the last section.We analyze the orbits of a unit mass body in a background Reissner–Nordstr\(\ddot{\textrm{o}}\)m (RN) black hole in\(d\)\(=\)\((3+1)\)from the perspectives of Geometric Torsion (GT) modified gravity theory in\((4+1)\)dimensional bulk. A 4-form flux in bulk GT theory in\(d\)\(=\)\((4+1)\)has been shown to ensure a mass dipole correction to the\((3+1)\)dimensional gravity theory by Gupta, Kar and Rang recently. We argue that the dipole correction contributes topologically to the known exact geometries in General Theory of Relativity (GTR). Furthermore, the topological correction has been identified with non-Newtonian potential underlying a\(B_2 \wedge F_2\)coupling term to Einstein–Hilbert action. The winding numbers ensured by theBFcoupling to\(d=(3+1)\)action in the framework presumably provide a clue towards a tunneling instanton in theory.We investigate the meson-baryon interaction in coupled channels with the quantum numbers of the pentaquarks\(P_{bss}\)and\(P_{bsss}\). The interaction is derived from an extension of the local hidden gauge approach to the heavy quark sector, which has demonstrated accurate results compared to experiments involving\(\Omega _{b}\),\(\Xi _{b}\)states, and pentaquarks\(P_{c}\)and\(P_{cs}\). In our study, we identify several molecular states with small decay widths within the chosen set of coupled channels. The spin-parity (\(J^P\)) of these states is as follows:\(J^P={\frac{1}{2}}^-\)for pseudoscalar-baryon (\({\frac{1}{2}}^+\)) coupled channels,\(J^P={\frac{3}{2}}^-\)for pseudoscalar-baryon (\({\frac{3}{2}}^+\)) coupled channels,\(J^P={\frac{1}{2}}^-\)and\({\frac{3}{2}}^-\)for vector-baryon (\({\frac{1}{2}}^+\)) coupled channels, and\(J^P={\frac{1}{2}}^-\),\({\frac{3}{2}}^-\),\({\frac{5}{2}}^-\)for vector-baryon (\({\frac{3}{2}}^+\)) coupled channels. We search for the poles of these states and evaluate their couplings to the different channels.We present a study on quantum gravity effects on the shadow of a rotating black hole (BH) obtained in the setting of the asymptotically safe gravity. The rotating metric, which results from a static regular one recently presented in the literature, is generated by using the generalized Newman-Janis algorithm. The novelty of the static regular metric lies in the fact that it is the outcome of an effective Lagrangian which describes dust whose spherically symmetric collapse is non-singular as a consequence of the antiscreening character of gravity at small distances. The effective Lagrangian includes a multiplicative coupling, denoted as\(\chi \), with the Lagrangian of the collapsing fluid. The resulting exterior metric for large radii depends on a free parameter\(\xi \)which captures the quantum gravity effects. The form of the coupling\(\chi \)and its connection with the quantum parameter\(\xi \)are determined by the running of the Newton couplingG(k) along a renormalization group trajectory that stops at the ultraviolet non-gaussian fixed point of the asymptotic safety theory for quantum gravity. Varying both the spin parameter\(a_{\star }\)and the quantum parameter\(\xi \), we explore the quantum gravity effects on several astronomical observables used to describe the morphology of the shadow cast by rotating BHs. In order to obtain constraints on the parameter\(\xi \), we confront our results with the recent Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the shadows of the supermassive BHs\(\hbox {M87}^*\)and Sgr\(\hbox {A}^*\). We find that the ranges of variation of all the studied shadow observables fall entirely within the ranges determined by the EHT collaboration. We then conclude that the current astronomical data do not rule out the renormalization group improved rotating BH.The gauge formalism intelepalallel gravityprovides an interesting viewpoint to describe interactions according to an anholonomic observer’s tetrad basis. Without going into assessing the complete viability of quantization in an early stage, this paper explores classical gravity within the framework of a classical-to-quantum bridge between the SU(1, 3) Yang–Mills gauge formalism and the gauge-like treatment of teleparallel gravity. Specifically, the perturbed spacetime algebra with Weitzenböck connection can be assimilated to a local complexification based on the SU(1, 3) Yang–Mills theory, what we call hypercolor or, simply, color. The formulation of the hypercolor dynamics is build by a translational gauge, as in the teleparallel gravities. In particular, this work analyses small perturbations of a metric decomposition related to the Wilson line and the Kaluza–Klein metric, but obtaining electrodynamics in four dimensions. The spacetime coordinates are now matrices that represent elements of the\(\mathfrak {su}(1,3)\)algebra. To make compatible the formulation of a colored gravity with the Lorentz force and the Maxwell equations, it is enough to define every energy potential origin as 0 in the event horizon instead of the classic zero potential at infinity. Under the colored gravity framework, standard electromagnetism can be obtained as a particular abelian case.In this study, we demonstrate the potential of the NA64 experiment at CERN SPS to search for New Physics processes involving\(e\rightarrow \mu \)transitions after the collision of 100 GeV electrons with target nuclei. A new Dark Sector leptonic portal in which a scalar boson\(\varphi \)could be produced in the lepton-flavor-changing bremsstrahlung-like reaction,\(eN\rightarrow \mu N\varphi \), is used as benchmark process. In this work, we develop a realistic Monte Carlo simulation of the NA64 experimental setup implementing the differential and total production cross-section computed at exact tree-level and applying the Weiszäcker–Williams phase space approximation. Using this framework, we investigate the main background sources and calculate the expected sensitivity of the experiment. The results indicate that with minor setup optimization, NA64 can probe a large fraction of the available parameter space compatible with the muon\(g-2\)anomaly and the Dark Matter relic predictions in the context of a new Dark Sector leptonic portal with\(10^{11}\)EOT. This result paves the way to the exploration of lepton-flavour-changing transitions in NA64.In this paper, we study the one-loop effective potential of a derivative four-fermion model. As a result, an exact bumblebee-like potential is radiatively generated. Afterwards, we generalize our study for a finite temperature case and explicitly demonstrate the possibility of phase transitions allowing for the restoration of the Lorentz symmetry. We also investigate the low-energy effective action, from which we obtain the usual kinetic term and the corresponding bumblebee potential.The Yukawa coupling of fermions with a periodic bosonic background is shown to give rise to several bound states to the fermionic spectrum, with some bound states gluing together around specific energy eingenvalues as the Yukawa coupling increases. This effect induces the presence of degenerate energy states inside the fermionic gap and may be of current interest.In this work we study, within the framework of Cowling approximation, the effect of the electric charge on the gravitational wave frequency of fluid oscillation modes of strange quark stars. For this purpose, the dense matter of the stellar fluid is described by the MIT bag model equation of state (EoS), while for the electric charge profile, we consider that the electric charge density is proportional to the energy density. We find that the gravitational wave frequencies change with the increment of electric charge; these effects are more noticeable at higher total mass values. We obtain that thef-mode is very sensitive to the change in the electric charge of the star. Furthermore, in the case of the\(p_1\)mode, the effect of the electric charge is not very significant. Our results reveal that the study of the fundamental pulsation mode of an electrically charged compact star is very important in distinguishing whether compact stars could contain electric charge. We also employ another electric charge distribution profile that follows a power law, and it is found that thef-mode change is more noticeable than the\(p_1\)-mode when the electric charge is incremented.In this paper, we investigate certain aspects of Lee–Wick electrodynamics near a semitransparent planar mirror. Specifically, we derive the modified propagator for the Lee–Wick gauge field in the presence of the mirror and conduct a detailed analysis of the interaction energy and the interaction force that arise between the mirror and a stationary point-like charge. We demonstrate that there are several peculiarities in this interaction compared to the results obtained for Maxwell electrodynamics. Our focus is on the divergences mitigated by the Podolsky mass term.Considering a theory space consisting of a large number of five-dimensional Dirac fermion field theories including background abelian gauge fields, we can construct a theory similar to a continuous six-dimensional theory compactified with two-dimensional manifolds with and without magnetic flux or orbifolds as extra dimensions. This method, called dimensional deconstruction, can be used to construct a model with one-dimensional discrete space, which represents general graph structures. In this paper, we propose the models with two extra dimensions, which resemble two-dimensional tori, cylinders, and rectangular regions, as continuum limits. We also try to build a model that mimics one with the two-dimensional orbifold compactification.We study geometrically thick non-self gravitating equilibrium tori orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in swirling universes. This solution is axially symmetric and non-asymptotically flat, and its north and south hemispheres spin in opposite directions. Due to repulsive effects arising from the swirl of the background spacetime, the equilibrium torus exists only in the small swirling case. With the increase of the swirling parameter, the disk structure becomes small and the excretion of matter near the black hole becomes strong. Moreover, the odd\(Z_2\)symmetry of spacetimes originating from the swirling parameter yields that the orientation of closed equipotential surfaces deviates away from the horizontal axis and the corresponding disk does not longer possess the symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane. These significant features could help to further understand the equilibrium tori and geometrically thick accretion disks around black holes in swirling universes.In this paper, we investigate Morris–Thorne-type wormholes with global monopole charge using various shape function forms known in the literature. We solve the Einstein field equations incorporating an anisotropic energy–momentum tensor and obtain different physical quantities associated with the matter-content. A crucial aspect of this study is the non-exotic matter distribution, examined through the evaluation of energy conditions, and exploring how different shape functions impact these conditions. Additionally, the anisotropy parameter is calculated to quantify the extent of attractive or repulsive behavior. Our study demonstrates that for different types of shape function forms, the energy conditions are influenced by the global monopole parameter. Our findings provide valuable insights for further theoretical explorations of these fascinating hypothetical structures in the realm of general relativity and beyond.The maximum entropy spectral analysis (MESA) method, developed by Burg, offers a powerful tool for spectral estimation of a time-series. It relies on Jaynes’ maximum entropy principle, allowing the spectrum of a stochastic process to be inferred using the coefficients of an autoregressive process AR(p) of orderp. A closed-form recursive solution provides estimates for both the autoregressive coefficients and the orderpof the process. We provide a ready-to-use implementation of this algorithm in a Python package calledmemspectrum, characterized through power spectral density (PSD) analysis on synthetic data with known PSD and comparisons of different criteria for stopping the recursion. Additionally, we compare the performance of our implementation with the ubiquitous Welch algorithm, using synthetic data generated from the GW150914 strain spectrum released by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration. Our findings indicate that Burg’s method provides PSD estimates with systematically lower variance and bias. This is particularly manifest in the case of a small (O(5000)) number of data points, making Burg’s method most suitable to work in this regime. Since this is close to the typical length of analysed gravitational waves data, improving the estimate of the PSD in this regime leads to more reliable posterior profiles for the system under study. We conclude our investigation by utilising MESA, and its particularly easy parametrisation where the only free parameter is the order p of the AR process, to marginalise over the interferometers noise PSD in conjunction with inferring the parameters of GW150914The Belle collaboration recently reported a pro-mising candidate for the spin-2\(D^*\bar{D}^*\)partner of theX(3872), called the\(X_2\)for short, having a mass of\((4014.3 \pm 4.0 \pm 1.5)~\textrm{MeV}\)and a width of\((4 \pm 11 \pm 6)~\textrm{MeV} \). In present work, we assume the\(X_2\)as a pure molecule of the\(D^*\bar{D}^*\)under four cases, i.e., pure neutral components (\(\theta = 0\)), isospin singlet (\(\theta = \pi /4\)), neutral components dominant (\(\theta = \pi /6\)), and purely charged components (\(\theta = \pi /2\)), where\(\theta \)is a phase angle describing the proportion of neutral and charged constituents. Using an effective Lagrangian approach, we calculated the partial widths of\(X_2\rightarrow VV\)and\(X_2 \rightarrow PP\)(VandPstand for light vector and pseudoscalar mesons, respectively). The predicted decay widths of\(X_2 \rightarrow VV\)can reach a few hundreds of\(\textrm{keV}\), while the decay widths of\(X_2 \rightarrow PP\)are about several tens of\(\textrm{keV}\). In addition, the effects from the proportion of neutral and charged constituent on the decay widths of\(X_2\rightarrow VV\)andPPare also investigated. We hope that the present calculations will be checked experimentally in the future.In this work, we investigate the collective flow development in high energy proton proton (pp) collisions with a multiphase transport model (AMPT) based on PYTHIA8 initial conditions with a sub-nucleon structure. It is found that the PYTHIA8 based AMPT model can reasonably describe both the charged hadron productions and elliptic flow experimental data measured in pp collisions at\(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV. By turning on the parton and hadron rescatterings in AMPT separately, we find that the observed collective flow in pp collisions is largely developed during the parton evolution, while no significant flow effect can be generated with the pure hadronic rescatterings. It is also shown that the parton escape mechanism is important for describing both the magnitude of the two-particle cumulant and the sign of the four-particle cumulants. We emphasize that the strong mass ordering of the elliptic flow results from the coalescence process in the transport model and can thus be regarded as unique evidence related to the creation of deconfined parton matter in high energy pp collisions.As we know, the horizon area of a black hole will increase when it absorbs matter. Based on Barrow’s concept of a fractal black hole horizon, it has been proposed (Phys Lett B 831:137181, 2022) that for a spherically fractal structure, the minimum increase in the horizon area is the area of the smallest bubble sphere. The corresponding black hole entropy is of a logarithmic form, which is similar to that of Boltzmann entropy under a certain condition. Based on this, we re-derive the entropy of Barrow’s Einstein–power-Yang–Mills (EPYM) anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole, and calculate its temperature and heat capacity. There exists an interesting phenomenon wherein the ratio between Barrow’s temperature and the Hawking temperature of the EPYM AdS black hole is fully consistent with that of other Schwarzschild-like black holes. The Barrow and Hawking temperatures within a certain range of\(\Lambda \)are found to increase monotonically, and the corresponding heat capacities are all positive, which means that these black holes are thermodynamically stable. In addition, for Barrow’s EPYM AdS black hole, its heat capacity has a Schottky anomaly-like behavior, which may reflect the existence of a discrete energy level and microscopic degrees of freedom.We study the behavior of static, spherically symmetric solutions to the field equations of scalar–tensor theories (STT) of gravity belonging to the Bergmann–Wagoner–Nordtvedt class, in the presence of an electric and/or magnetic charge. This class of theories includes the Brans–Dicke, Barker and Schwinger STT as well as nonminimally coupled scalar fields with an arbitrary parameter\(\xi \). The study is restricted to canonical (nonphantom) versions of the theories and scalar fields without a self-interaction potential. Only radial (monopole) perturbations are considered as the most likely ones to cause an instability. The static background solutions contain naked singularities, but we formulate the boundary conditions in such a way that would preserve their meaning if a singularity is smoothed, for example, due to quantum gravity effects. These boundary conditions look more physical than those used by other authors. Since the solutions of all STT under study are related by conformal transformations, the stability problem for all of them reduces to the same wave equation, but the boundary conditions for perturbations (and sometimes the boundaries themselves) are different in different STT, which affects the stability results. The stability or instability conclusions are obtained for different branches of solutions in the theories under consideration and are presented in a table form.Cygnusis a proposed global network of large-scale gas time projection chambers (TPCs) with the capability of directionally detecting nuclear and electron recoils at\(\gtrsim \)keV energies. The primary focus ofCygnusso far has been the detection of dark matter, with directional sensitivity providing a means of circumventing the so-called “neutrino fog”. However, the excellent background rejection and electron/nuclear recoil discrimination provided by the 3-dimensional reconstruction of ionisation tracks could turn the solar neutrino background into an interesting signal in its own right. For example, directionality would facilitate the simultaneous spectroscopy of multiple different flux sources. Here, we evaluate the possibility of measuring solar neutrinos using the same network of gas TPCs built from 10 m\(^3\)-scale modules operating under conditions that enable simultaneous sensitivity to both dark matter and neutrinos. We focus in particular on electron recoils, which provide access to low-energy neutrino fluxes likepp,pep,\(^7\)Be, and CNO. An appreciable event rate is already detectable in experiments consisting of a single 10 m\(^3\)module, assuming standard fill gases such as CF\(_4\)mixed with helium at atmospheric pressure. With total volumes around 1000 m\(^3\)or higher, the TPC network could be complementary to dedicated neutrino observatories, whilst entering the dark-matter neutrino fog via the nuclear recoil channel. We evaluate the required directional performance and background conditions to observe, discriminate, and perform spectroscopy on neutrino events. We find that, under reasonable projections for planned technology that will enable 10–30-degree angular resolution and\(\sim 10\)% fractional energy resolution,Cygnuscould be a competitive directional neutrino experiment.The dark matter halo has non-negligible effects on the gravitational lensing of supermassive black hole in the galaxy center. Our work presents a study on the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing of black holes enclosed by dark matter halos. To provide a precise description on the distribution of dark matter in galaxies, we choose several famous phenomenological dark matter halo models in astrophysics, including the NFW, Beta, Burkert and Moore models, to carry out the present study. Through numerically calculating the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing, a comparative analysis of the dark matter effects within different halo models has been performed. Assuming typical length scales associated with the galactic gravitational lensing, numerical results indicate that the NFW, Beta, Burkert and Moore dark matter halos can significantly enhance the time delay of light in gravitational lenisng of central supermassive black holes. The enhancing effect becomes more pronounced with a small dark matter halo scale and an increasing dark matter halo mass.We explore the possibility of detecting the couplings of axion-like particle (ALP) with leptons from their loop-level impact on the ALP couplings to electroweak (EW) gauge bosons via the signal processat the circular electron positron collider (CEPC) and obtain prospective sensitivities to the ALP-lepton couplings. Our numerical results show that the CEPC with the center of mass energy\(\sqrt{s}=240~(91)\)GeV and the integrated luminosity\(\mathcal {L}=5.6~(16)\)\(\hbox {ab}^{-1}\)might be sensitive for probing the ALP-lepton couplings in the ALP mass range from 10 GeV to 130 (50) GeV, where the prospective sensitivities to the ALP-neutrino coupling\(Tr(g_{a\nu \nu })/f_a\)can be as low as 0.016 (0.012)\(\hbox {GeV}^{-1}\)and\(0.0031~(2.8 \times 10^{-4})\)\(\hbox {GeV}^{-1}\)for\(c_{R}=0\)and\(c_{R}=c_{L}\), and to the ALP-charged lepton coupling\(Tr(g_{a\ell \ell })/f_a\)can be as low as 0.035 (0.07)\(\hbox {GeV}^{-1}\)for\(c_{L}=0\). We find that the prospective sensitivities given by the CEPC are not covered by the current and expected exclusion regions in some ALP mass intervals. The CEPC has the potential for exploring the ALP-neutrino couplings via some promising processes induced by the ALP-EW gauge boson couplings in the future.We investigate the medium modifications in mass and decay width of\(\phi \)meson in the presence of an external magnetic field. The in-medium mass of\(\phi \)meson has been calculated using the decay process\(\phi \)\(\rightarrow \)\(K {\bar{K}}\)at one-loop level. The medium modifications are introduced by using a chiral SU(3) model employing a mean-field effective approach. Due to the introduction of the magnetic field, masses of charged\(K^+\)and\(K^-\)increases with advancing magnetic field values. A negligible change in the value of neutral\(K^0\)and\({\bar{K}}^0\)has been observed for varying magnetic fields. Due to electromagnetic interactions with chargedKand\({\bar{K}}\)mesons, there is a gradual augmentation in the effective mass of\(\phi \)meson. The probability of the mentioned decay process ceases to be zero for low density and strangeness fraction values at higher magnetic field values. Investigating the decay width and effective mass of\(\phi \)meson under the influence of an external magnetic field is relevant to understanding the hadronic matter properties under extreme conditions achievable at heavy-ion collision experiments.We study a long-overlooked CP violation observable, termed double-mixing CP violation, which arises from the interference between two neutral meson oscillating paths involved in a decay chain. The double-mixing CP violation is beneficial for the precise test of the Standard Model CKM mechanism, as it offers the potential to extract weak phases without pollution from strong dynamics. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the double-mixing CP violation, we perform phenomenological analyses on the cascade decays of the\(B^0_d\)and\(B^0_s\)mesons. Our results show that the double-mixing CP violation can be very significant in certain decay channels, such as\(B^0_d \rightarrow J/\psi K \rightarrow J/\psi (\pi ^+\ell ^-{\bar{\nu }}_\ell )\), where the total CP violation arises almost entirely from the double-mixing CP violation. In addition, we employ the decay process\(B^0_d \rightarrow D^0 K \rightarrow (K^-\pi ^+)(\pi \ell \nu )\)to demonstrate that the involved strong and weak phases can be directly determined from the experimental data without any theoretical inputs. Specifically, the overall weak phase of this process is\(2\beta +\gamma \), which is of significant importance for extracting the CKM phase angles. We also use\(B^0_s \rightarrow \rho ^0 K \rightarrow \rho ^0(\pi ^-\ell ^+\nu _\ell )\)to illustrate and discuss the significant importance of\(K^0_S - K^0_L\)interference.In this work, we study metric-Palatini gravity extended by the antisymmetric part of the affine curvature. This gravity theory leads to general relativity plus a geometric Proca field. Using our previous construction of its static spherically-symmetric AdS solution (Eur Phys J. C 83(4):318, 2023), we perform a detailed analysis in this work using the observational quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) data. To this end, we use the latest data from stellar-mass black hole GRO J1655-40, intermediate-mass black hole in M82-X1, and the super-massive black hole in SgA* (our Milky Way) and perform a Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain (MCMC) analysis to determine or bound the model parameters. Our results shed light on the allowed ranges of the Proca mass and other parameters. The results imply that our solutions can cover all three astrophysical black holes. Our analysis can also be extended to more general metric-affine gravity theories.
