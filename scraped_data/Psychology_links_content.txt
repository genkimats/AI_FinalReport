Sensory marketing recognizes the significance of physical experiences in product evaluation and consumer decision-making. This study examined the effects of model features in fashion advertising and consumer physical characteristics on consumer attitudes, drawing on embodied cognition theory. In Study 1, consumers completed a Go/NoGo task, recognition task, and product evaluation. Results showed that model position significantly affects consumer attitudes: right-handed people rated the right position better. Additionally, trait body image can influence this position effect. In Studies 2 and 3, we activated and manipulated state body image, respectively, and discovered the interactive effects of model position, model attractiveness, and consumer body image. Individuals with high body image responded positively to highly attractive models on the right, while those with low body image favored right-positioned less attractive models. These findings provide empirical evidence that body image shapes how people’s bodies interact with the world, and provide practical guidance for sensory marketing.

The emergence of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has significantly impacted daily existence and affects not only respiratory functions but also psychological well-being and musculoskeletal health. Despite the considerable body of research examining the effects of COVID-19 on adults and older populations, the consequences on adolescents remain relatively underexplored. This study explored the COVID-19 impact on physical capacity, self-reported outcomes, and mental health in late adolescents who graduated from high school. The late adolescents were divided into recovered from mild COVID-19 (RFC,n= 68) group and healthy late adolescent controls without diagnosed COVID-19 (HC,n= 70) before. Physical capacity (shoulder flexor/abductor and elbow flexor/extensor muscle strength, back and leg power, and mobility), self-reported outcomes (kinesiophobia, emotional intelligence, and quality of life), and mental health were assessed. The mean follow-up of mild COVID-19 diagnosis in the RFC group was 12.20 ± 1.79 weeks. The results indicated a reduction in physical capacity among the RFC group compared to the HC group (p≤ 0.014). Furthermore, the RFC group exhibited higher levels of kinesiophobia (p= 0.001), lower quality of life (p< 0.05), and increased stress related to mental health (p= 0.004). However, it was noted that emotional intelligence was higher in the RFC group (p= 0.005). Mild COVID-19 adversely impacts physical capacity, life quality, kinesiophobia, and stress aspects of mental health in late adolescents. Thus, public health professionals and school administrators must recognize these consequences and collaboratively implement measures to improve physical activity levels through well-designed physical training programs and offer psychological support for late adolescents.

Research on men and masculinities is increasingly concerned with contemporary transformations in the way men understand and “do” gender. In particular, burgeoning paradigms like the hybrid masculinities framework have called attention to diverse patterns of practice among men that are seemingly at odds with traditional iterations of hegemonic masculinity. We conceptualize one component of this practice as a concerted process of “strategic masculine disinvestment.” Using new, nationally representative survey data pertaining to men living in the United States, we ask two novel questions about this phenomenon that have not been addressed at the population level. First,whodisinvests from traditional masculinity? While masculine distancing tends to be observed among privileged men in qualitative studies, a comprehensive view of which men engage in this practice within the general population is absent from the literature. Secondly, how are contemporary transformations of gender like strategic masculine disinvestment associated with psychosocial functioning? Findings suggest that strategic masculine disinvestment is more common among young and college educated men, but is not necessarily unique to unilaterally privileged men. In fact, men experiencing financial strain are especially likely to disinvest from masculinity. We also observe that strategic masculine disinvestment is consistently associated with poorer psychosocial functioning, including lower levels of mastery and higher levels of anger, anxiety, depression, and non-specific psychological distress. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for studies of men and masculinities and of contemporary transformations of gender more generally.

Digital parent training programs (DPTs) aimed at treating child behavior problems have shown efficacy in a number of trials, but less is known about the active ingredients parents find helpful while using DPTs. We analyzed data from users of self-guided DPTs within a randomized controlled trial setting: a standard program (DPT-STD) and an enhanced program (DPT-TP). Thematic analysis of interviews (n= 16) reveals that users of both programs endorsed the “content”, “content presentation”, “accessibility”, and “therapeutic context” as beneficial. However, only DPT-TP users identified the “therapeutic persuasiveness” as helpful, attributing this to features embedded exclusively in the enhanced program, including call-to-action reminders and assessment-based feedback. Findings were reinforced by the analysis of responses to open-ended questions from a larger sample of users (n= 31 DPT-STD users andn= 34 DPT-TP users). These findings underscore the importance of utilizing features that help parents make positive changes in their home.

This study examined the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders among youth in Kumasi, Ghana, through a community-based cross-sectional survey. 672 urban participants aged 6–17 years were surveyed. Mental disorders were screened using Rutter’s A2 Scale for Parent Assessment of Child Behaviour, with diagnoses confirmed by the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. The Double Sampling method was used for weighted prevalence estimates, and correlates analysed using chi-square and logistic regression. Lifetime weighted prevalence of CAMH disorders was 30.4% (95% CI: 26.9–33.9), predominantly anxiety-related disorders, with current weighted prevalence 18.6% (95% CI: 15.7–21.5). Notably, lacking an active reading habit was associated with nearly three times the odds of mental illness. Children in the 3rd and 4th wealth quintiles had significantly higher odds of mental disorder (12- and 9-times increased odds, respectively), as did lack of caregiver homework supervision among children under 11 years. This study provides the first community-based prevalence figures for childhood mental disorders in Ghana, highlighting the link between poverty-related factors and mental health, and suggesting potential policy interventions to inform policy.

This study examines how different green demarketing information types affect consumers’ brand evaluation and psychological processes. Based on three experiments conducted in China, our results reveal that specific claims have stronger effects on brand evaluations than vague claims. Additionally, specific (or vague) claims have a stronger indirect positive impact by stimulating environmental concern inferences and attitudes toward an ad when matched with loss (or gain) framing. Besides that, perceived environmental relevance of a product moderated this interaction effect, with specific claims using loss framing being more appropriate for high environmental relevance products, while low environmental relevance products are more appropriate for vague claims using gain framing. Therefore, green demarketing may significantly influence establishment of a favorable brand reputation and provide theoretical support for selecting and maximizing green demarketing strategies in the future.

The focus of this pilot investigation was to determine if the EA Briefing (previously referred to as the EA Brief), could improve self-reported and observed emotional availability (EA) as well as maternal wellbeing. Participants in this study were mothers and their children, including infants, preschoolers, school-aged children, and adolescents. All assessments were administered prior to and at the end of the intervention. These assessments included the observational Emotional Availability (EA) Scales, the Emotional Availability Self-Report (EA-SR), and the Flourishing Scale. During the intervention, mother-child dyads were in their homes and filmed via Zoom. Each mother completed a single, short, individualized parent feedback and coaching session and received information about emotional availability, attachment, and mindfulness. Results examined differences between the groups and indicated that those who received the intervention showed more improvement in observed EA and self-reported EA than those who did not. Additionally, parent-child dyads of all age groups in the study demonstrated improvements. This suggests that the EA Briefing may be relevant for a wider age range of children than have previously participated. The study may also encourage other attachment-based interventions to examine their effectiveness with older children.

People use cues of facial gender typicality when making sexual orientation judgements, where gender typical faces (masculine men and feminine women) are more likely to be judged as heterosexual and gender atypical faces (feminine men and masculine women) are judged as non-heterosexual. Individual differences in the belief of associated stereotypes have been shown to influence how these stereotypes are used to make social judgments of others; therefore, across two studies, we tested whether the strength of beliefs in gender stereotypes impacted how facial gender typicality cues were used when making sexual orientation judgements. In both Study 1 and 2 (n= 283 and 219, respectively), participants made sexual orientation judgements of 80 faces (40 male, 40 female) that varied in gender typicality and completed a measure of belief in gender stereotypes. In Study 2, participants also completed a sexual prejudice measure. In line with predictions, both studies found that the strength in belief of gender stereotypes significantly moderated the use of facial gender typicality cues when making sexual orientation judgements. Participants with a greater belief in gender stereotypes were more likely to judge a face as heterosexual as gender typicality increased. In Study 2, the association between sexual prejudice and use of gender typicality cues was fully mediated by beliefs in gender role stereotypes. These results highlight the importance of considering individual differences of the perceiver and how they can interact with cues from a target, particularly when making sexual orientation judgements.

IntroductionThis study analyzed the relationship between the social inclusion of LGBTI people and economic development. In this study, we have observed HDI and GDP per capita (PPP) in association with the LGBT + Rights and Inclusion Index for India from 1990 to 2022. The index accounts for microeconomic effects, whereas the controls account for the overall impact on the macroeconomic level.MethodsWe employ an OLS and robust least squares approach, in conjunction with the author’s developed “Inclusion Index” dataset, to examine the integration of LGBTI individuals into the Indian economy.ResultsIndia’s Inclusion Index scores 0.51 out of 1. Further, our study finds that an additional point on the LGBT + Rights scale of legal rights is associated with an increase in GDP per capita (PPP) of approximately $668 and a 0.035 increase in HDI value. Additionally, integrating the LGBTI community into the health, education, personal safety, and violence aspects of the Inclusion Index increases the GDP per capita (PPP) by about 0.608%, according to the approximation.ConclusionsCombining the in-depth, subjective information on the actual experiences of LGBTI individuals with the broader statistical modeling leads to a compatible outcome—there exists an apparent relationship between LGBTI inclusiveness and the development of the economy.Policy Implications.By promoting LGBTI inclusivity on the microeconomic spectrum, specifically through the Inclusion Index’s dimensions, we can foster wholesome inclusivity that aligns with the macroeconomic spectrum, particularly the variables examined in the study.

Academic engagement stands as a pivotal factor in fostering college students’ academic success and bolstering their competitiveness in the job market. However, college students are generally insufficiently invested in academic pursuits. Future time perspective (FTP) has been shown to be correlated to students’ academic engagement, and career adaptation is an essential competency for college students during the vocational transition phase. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the longitudinal relationship between FTP and academic engagement, and to explore the potential mediating role of career adaptability in this relationship. This three-wave longitudinal design included data from 259 first-year Chinese college students regarding their FTP, career adaptability, and academic engagement over six-month intervals (Time 1, October 2021; Time 2, April 2022; Time 3, October 2022). Cross-lagged models indicated that (1) FTP significantly and positively predicted subsequent academic engagement across all time points, (2) academic engagement significantly and positively predicted subsequent FTP across all time points, and (3) the relationship between FTP at Time 1 and academic engagement at Time 3 was mediated by career adaptability at Time 2. Thus, a significant temporal and bidirectional association exists between FTP and academic engagement with career adaptability as a mediator. These findings extend FTP and career construction theories to non-Western cultures and have implications for interventions targeting academic engagement and dropout rates.

This study aimed to examine associations of mental health symptoms with physical fitness indicators among Chinese college freshmen. 3667 Chinese college freshmen with an average age of 18.40 ± 0.81 were randomly recruited to participate in the cross-sectional study in 2017. Various physical fitness indicators were measured and overall physical fitness score was calculated according to the Chinese National Student Physical Fitness Standard. The total score of University Personality Inventory (UPI) and the depressive UPI score was measured via questionnaires to indicate overall mental health and depressive symptoms. We hypothesized that poor mental health status would associate with worse physical fitness. Multiple linear regressions and restricted cubic splines were adopted to assess the associations between UPI-measured mental health and physical fitness. The UPI-measured overall mental health was associated with several physical fitness indicators (e.g., 50-m sprint run [β= 0.0046,p= 0.023]) and total physical fitness score. Such associations were more significant within males and the only child. Overall physical fitness performance decreased rapidly when the total UPI score was greater than 10 points. Therefore, mental health problems among Chinese college freshmen are associated with poor physical fitness performance, especially for males and the only child. Interventions are urgent needs to provide for college freshmen who have depressive symptoms or get more than 10 points of the total UPI score. This article provides theoretical research guidance for students and schools to further prevent physical and mental problems simultaneously among college students.

The study aimed to develop and psychometrically test the Fertility Healthy Lifestyle Assessment Scale among the Turkish female/male population. This methodological study was conducted through an online survey with 526 participants (n= 340 women,n= 186 men) using the Google Forms tool between July 2020 and December 2021. The scale development process involved 4 steps: item generation, expert review and content validity, pilot study, and a field study with psychometric testing. The scale consisted of 46 items across seven sub-dimensions (emotional well-being, physical activity, sleep, nutrition, clothing/hygiene, use of technology, and spirituality). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the 7-factor structure of the Fertility Healthy Lifestyle Assessment Scale (factor loadings 0.33–0.99 according to CFA), and the fit indices of the scale (RMSEA = 0.067, GFI = 0.748, CFI = 0.924, IFI = 0.925, NNFI = 0.918 and NFI = 0.868) were found to be adequate. The seven sub-dimensions accounted for 71.25% of the total variance. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the total scale was 0.872, indicating strong internal consistency. As a result of the split into two analyses, Cronbach’s alpha value of the first half was 0.722 and the value of the second half was 0.780, with a correlation of 0.898 between the two halves. Our findings indicate that the Fertility Healthy Lifestyle Assessment Scale is a valid and reliable measurement for assessing healthy lifestyle habits with the purpose of enhancing fertility in women and men.

A premise of statistical learning research is that learners attend to and learn the frequencies of co-occurring sounds in the input, or phonotactic sequences. Inherent to the concepts of both frequency and phonotactics is order, or the temporal arrangement of the relevant elements. Order is similarly inherent to statistical learning, yet the effect of order on statistical learning is not well understood. In the present study, adult participants learned the relative frequencies of eight consonant sequences, for example, /mk/ and /st/ in the nonwords /nʌmkət/ and /gɪstək/. Both familiarization and test stimuli were independently ordered and randomized, thus allowing for a relatively broad search for order effects in an established statistical learning paradigm. Participants learned the target frequencies equivalently across the five ordering conditions, indicating no modulating effect of order. Nevertheless, the results reflect an initial pass at further integration of statistical learning with existing research on the effects of order in memory and general cognition. (155 words).

IntroductionSexual choking has become prevalent among young U.S. adults. Little is known about how people learn about this sexual practice.MethodData are from a 2021 campus-representative confidential online survey of 4254 students at a large public U.S. university. We aimed to examine (a) where students had first learned about choking; (b) where they had learned the most about choking; (c) their perceptions of choking; and (d) how sources of learning were associated with perceptions of choking.ResultsThe top three sources of having first learned about choking were friends (35.1%), pornography (34.5%), and sexual partners (30.1%). Students reported learning the most about choking from partners (30.7%), friends (28.8%), and pornographic videos (25.1%). Most participants (88.9%) agreed/strongly agreed that people could die from being choked during sex, yet 37.5% endorsed choking as safe and half (49.6%) reported knowing how to engage in choking safely. Those who had learned the most about choking from other people more often agreed that choking was safe and that they know how to engage in choking safely. Those who had learned the most from media sources more often agreed with the importance of verbal consent, safe gestures, and being sober when engaging in choking.ConclusionYoung adults report learning about choking from varied sources which have implications for their perceptions of choking and its health consequences.Policy ImplicationsFindings have implications for sexuality educators (e.g., providing fact-based information about sexual choking to college students) and clinicians, who might consider anticipatory guidance on choking.

Sexual and gender diverse youth and young adults (SGDY) experience significant mental health disparities compared to non-SGDY and lack access to culturally responsive mental health supports. Limited literature on affirmative interventions for SGDY exists. As part of a larger pilot study, the present qualitative study sought to understand the experiences of SGDY who received the Tuned In! intervention to explore its potential benefit in supporting SGDY mental health. Tuned In! is a virtual affirmative mindfulness-based intervention, co-created with and for SGDY. SGDY (16–29 yrs.) were recruited from Connecticut to participate in the intervention via social media advertisements, and were invited to follow-up virtual focus groups after completing the intervention. Twenty-five SGDY participated in four virtual focus groups, with an additional 12 SGDY providing written feedback. The following overarching research questions guided this study: (1) What are the experiences of SGDY participating in the Tuned In! intervention? (2) What specific improvements are needed to provide enhanced support for SGDY participating in the Tuned In! intervention? Reflexive thematic analysis revealed three overarching themes: (1) mindfulness and self-compassion can support SGDY well-being, (2) spaces that cultivate SGDY community, and (3) the importance of diversity, safety, inclusion, and accessibility. Findings suggest Tuned In! can support SGDY mental health, which points to practical recommendations for future evaluation and implementation of affirmative mindfulness-based interventions for SGDY.

In contrast to the international context of residential care and the preference for family based care, residential care in Portugal is the only option for most young people in the child protection system. Despite this, research in Portugal has yet to focus on Therapeutic Residential Care (TRC) and has rarely considered the narratives of young people. By adopting the conceptual framework proposed by Farmer et al. (2017) and focusing on five critical domains (Setting, Staffing, Treatment Approach, Safety, and Milieu Factor), we aimed to identify a subset of factors that contribute to youth improvement. This convergent parallel mixed methods study involved conducting semi-structured interviews with 14 young people, mostly female (71%), aged 14–18 years (M= 16.3,SD= 1.8), at five TRC facilities in Portugal. Young people and staff also completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and the youth self-report or child behaviour checklist to assess internalising and externalising symptoms. Content analysis revealed mostly positive perceptions and experiences across the domains (Setting, Staffing, Treatment Approach, Safety, Milieu Factor and Profile Characteristics). However, half of the youth reported being vulnerable to peer contagion and females with higher internalising and externalising symptoms reported more negative perceptions and experiences of TRC. These findings highlight that creating an organisational social context that supports participatory approaches to assessing quality may provide invaluable insights into how services can be responsive to young people’s needs. Focusing on establishing high-quality relationships with staff, peers, family, and the community may be key to ensuring the long-term success of TRC.

Prediction is known to play a role in language processing for monolingual as well as bilingual language users. Less understood is what happens when language users encounter mispredictions. While previous studies have shown that mispredictions result in reduced efficiency in language processing, it is unclear whether this is caused by abandoning the prediction and adopting the actual input, or by attempts to reconcile the prediction with the input. The present study investigated how language users from a varied language community manage misprediction in written and spoken English caused by incongruency between verb re-mention bias and pronominal reference. We predicted more pronoun repetition errors in incongruent contexts (Lisa annoys Peter because he...) compared to congruent contexts (Lisa annoys Peter because she...). We further asked whether language experience, operationalized as age of English acquisition and early bilingualism, modulates the management of mispredictions in this context. In three experiments, we used a novel adaptation of a sentence repetition paradigm focused on pronoun recall. English language users were presented with spoken or written sentence prompts, repeated them from memory, and produced continuations. We found that pronouns in congruent sentence prompts were repeated more accurately in both speech and writing compared to in incongruent ones, regardless of age of English acquisition and early bilingualism. These results reveal that re-mention biases affect how information is encoded and recalled. We argue that the results further suggest the occurrence of mispredictions on the discourse-level in English text and speech, which may have upstream consequences. Furthermore, these mispredictions are managed similarly in English by language users from vastly different language backgrounds.

Based on the assumption that language influences thinking, the present study investigated the effect of gender-fair language in German, a grammatically gendered language among primary school children. Specifically, in a single-study experiment, we compared 218 German third and fourth graders on the effects of the generic masculine (e.g.,der Polizist; English:the policeman) and gender-fair language in terms of the feminine and masculine form (e.g.,die Polizistin/der Polizist; English:the policewoman/the policeman) on the cognitive representation of women in stereotypically masculine occupations and occupational self-efficacy. General self-efficacy was examined as a moderator variable, assumed to influence the effect of gender-fair language on occupational self-efficacy. The results indicate that the gender-fair form led to a higher cognitive representation of women in stereotypically masculine occupations for girls and increased girls’ occupational self-efficacy for stereotypically masculine occupations. In contrast, the use of gender-fair language did not significantly influence boys’ cognitive representation of women and their occupational self-efficacy. General self-efficacy did not affect the effect of gender-fair language on occupational self-efficacy. Thus, even as early as in primary school, gender-fair language could help attracting girls to stereotypically masculine occupations.

The present study aims to extend knowledge on the relationship between humor styles, optimism and quality of life by employing the typological approach. Therefore, humor profiles were examined as patterns of humor styles and compared within profiles. The sample of 725 respondents from Spanish community was tested using Humor Styles Questionnaire, Life Orientation Test – Revised and the 12-Item Short Form Survey. Initial insight into the relations between humor styles, optimism and quality of life was provided using correlations controlling for gender, age, and socio-economic status, showing that optimism and quality of life measures correlated positively with affiliative and self-enhancing humor, and negatively with self-defeating humor styles. Four humor profiles (humor enhancers, endorsers, deniers and detrimenters) were identified using latent profile analysis, with the pairwise comparisons between the profiles in the analysis of differences in optimism and quality of life. Results revealed higher optimism and quality of life at humor profiles whose members use positive humor styles compared to profiles whose members use only negative humor styles, or do not use any kind of humor. In addition, significant role of gender, age and socio-economic position on observed relationship were confirmed. Advantages of typological approach in research of humor styles were discussed.

This study utilized latent class growth modeling (LCGM) to identify four kinds of math achievement trajectories across grades 4–6. In addition latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to Identify four motivational profiles in grade 4. We also examined the relation between these math achievement trajectories and motivational profiles. Data were collected from 3,772 children. Results showed that only children in the “high quality” motivation profile had greater probabilities of following favorable math achievement developmental patterns. This result indicated that motivation quality is more important than the amount of motivation not only for children’s current academic achievement but also for their academic developmental trajectories in the long term.

In Korea, parents of children with developmental disabilities (DDs) face significant societal stigma, negatively affecting their mental well-being and quality of life. Accepting a child’s disability significantly impacts family psychosocial dynamics and long-term planning. This study aimed to uncover factors affecting disability acceptance among these parents using a mixed methods sequential exploratory approach. We interviewed eight South Korean parents of children with DDs aged 5–35 and analyzed their responses to identify factors promoting or hindering acceptance. The analysis identified factors like emotion regulation, family support, religious activities, and societal perception. We the identified factors, we conducted a quantitative study of 200 parents of children aged 3–40, collaborating with the National Association of Parents of Disabled Children and an online community. The analysis indicated that positive emotion regulation promoted acceptance, while negative emotions and societal stigma hindered it. Family support was crucial, but peer or expert support showed minimal impact. The study emphasizes the importance of emotion regulation, family support, and societal awareness. Further studies should focus on refining interventions based on these findings.

Some evidence indicates that a person’s attitude towards emotion (ATE; measured as liking/disliking of a discrete emotion) predicts the person’s situation selection (e.g., choice of emotional images), which is an essential part of emotion regulation. Would the association between ATE and stimulus selection be generalized to other types of ATE and stimuli? This study aimed to examine whether implicit and explicit fear of emotion (i.e., fear of experiencing an emotion due to concerns about losing control over the emotion) would predict the avoidance of emotion-inducing music. Seventy-three female university students, among whom approximately one third showed mild or above depressive symptoms, reported implicit and explicit fear of positive emotion and depression. Participants also completed the music choice task in which they were presented with a pair of emotional music excerpts and chose one they preferred to listen to. Results showed that those with greater implicit fear of positive emotion avoided the choice of high-arousal happiness-inducing music excerpts, particularly when the music was paired with high-arousal sadness and neutral-inducing excerpts. These results emphasise the need to consider both implicit and explicit processes, as well as arousal and valence, in understanding the role of fear of emotion in situation selection.

The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) within organizational processes has profound implications for employee creativity and organizational innovation. This study examines how AI adoption influences employee creativity through the mediating role of creative self-efficacy, and how transformational leadership moderates this relationship. By integrating social cognitive theory and social exchange theory, we hypothesize that AI adoption enhances employee creativity, primarily through increased creative self-efficacy. Furthermore, we posit that transformational leadership strengthens the positive impact of AI adoption on creative self-efficacy, thereby amplifying its effect on creativity. By collecting three-wave time-lagged data from a final sample of 236 full-time working adults in South Korea, our findings provide robust support for the proposed hypotheses. AI adoption was positively associated with employee creativity and creative self-efficacy. Creative self-efficacy, in turn, significantly predicted employee creativity and mediated the relationship between AI adoption and creativity. Additionally, transformational leadership moderated the relationship between AI adoption and creative self-efficacy, with stronger effects observed under high transformational leadership conditions. These results offer significant theoretical and practical contributions by integrating AI adoption with creativity and leadership research, highlighting the crucial roles of psychological mechanisms and leadership dynamics in fostering innovation.

Leaders often find themselves in complex situations in which they must navigate competing and contradictory demands. Consequently, leaders often experience ambivalence. While followers pay close attention to leaders and use their leaders’ behaviors and emotions as cues for modeling their own behavior, there is little empirical work exploring how followers perceive leader ambivalence and how these perceptions affect followers. Therefore, in three studies (totalN= 879), we examined whether perceiving leader ambivalence could facilitate followers’ willingness to speak up. We also investigated the underlying mechanism of this effect, testing whether perceptions of leader ambivalence led to inferences of both higher leader cognitive flexibility and responsiveness, which then would increase the likelihood that followers speak up. In line with our hypotheses, followers showed a greater willingness to speak up when perceiving an ambivalent leader than a non-ambivalent leader. This effect was serially mediated by perceptions of both increased leader cognitive flexibility and responsiveness. Study 3 also showed that when followers perceived an ambivalent leader, they expected fewer negative consequences when speaking up about a variety of issues (e.g., response to dissatisfaction). We discuss the implications of our findings for future research on ambivalence in leadership and organizational contexts.

This article calls for expanding the conceptualization of school attendance problems (SAPs). It offers a hermeneutic phenomenological exploration using the youth’s lived experiences. Attention is paid to bodily reactions and emotions in student narratives. Our goal is to aid research on prolonged absences from school by promoting studies that encourage teachers to investigate school cultures and climates. School personnel are essential in preventing and handling classroom SAPs and creating situated pathways among stakeholders. We interviewed nine students to learn about barriers and facilitators to school attendance. We used quotes from the interviews to make goals for understanding SAPs in schools. Using poetic inquiry as a qualitative method, we offer an aesthetic perspective to understand SAPs. The poems attempt to capture youth’s nonverbal experiences with prolonged school absences. The results provide insights into youth, schools, and professionals regarding the connection between hope and SAPs. The role of hope is essential for students’ continuing education. Additionally, our results emphasize the need to include factors of belonging within the learning environment for early intervention, thereby increasing attendance, motivation, and long-term engagement in future education.

In response to Oman’s “Mindfulness for Global Public Health: Critical Analysis and Agenda” call for greater integration of mindfulness into global public health, this commentary proposes three complementary approaches: examining core psychological mechanisms of mindfulness, understanding its developmental progression, and implementing artificial intelligence (AI) technology to enhance accessibility. The commentary reviews some contemporary theoretical models of mindfulness to identify fundamental psychological mechanisms. Analysis included examination of mindfulness developmental progression (skill to state to trait) and exploration of artificial intelligence applications, specifically large language models (LLMs), in enhancing intervention delivery and accessibility. The identified psychological mechanisms—attention regulation and non-judgemental acceptance—represent fundamental psychological processes that transcend cultural differences, addressing Oman’s concerns about epidemiologic foundations (Axis A6) and cultural adaptability (Axis A10). Analysis of developmental progression revealed how mindfulness evolves from learned skill to psychological trait, informing implementation strategies. Analysis of LLM applications demonstrated potential for addressing equity concerns (Axis A9) through increasing accessibility among underserved populations while enabling culturally responsive adaptations. By examining mindfulness through its core psychological mechanisms, developmental progression, and AI-enabled delivery approaches, this commentary provides perspectives to address some challenges of global implementation identified by Oman. The mechanistic approach strengthens empirical foundations of mindfulness while supporting cultural adaptability, and emerging AI technologies present unprecedented opportunities to increase accessibility. However, realising this potential requires careful attention to ethical considerations and continued empirical validation of AI-supported mindfulness interventions.

Schoolteachers are a profession at high risk for workplace burnout. The Jobs Demands-Resource model is useful in understanding burnout in this population. However, a better understanding of what psychological and physiological factors serve as demands and resources, and how these might interact to predict burnout is needed. In this study, we obtained cardiac activity (Heart Rate Variability) over a working day, as well as self-reported stress and psychological measures of self-compassion, self-criticism, emotional exhaustion and dysregulation, depersonalisation, self-reassurance and personal accomplishment in a sample of 57 primary school staff. A logistic regression analysis identified self-compassion (OR= 12.91, 95%CI= 1.62–180.74) and self-criticism (OR= 1.25, 95%CI= 1.07–1.56) to be most strongly related to differences in Heart Rate Variability (root mean square of successive differences) between self-reported rest periods and periods of high stress. In addition, a mediation analysis revealed self-criticism was a significant predictor of the depersonalisation facet of burnout (z= 2.16,p= .03), whereas results for self-compassion were more complex and were mediated by physiological coping (i.e., Heart Rate Variability) (z= 2.60,p= .009). In the context of the Job Demands-Resources Model, we conclude that self-compassion can serve as an additional resource that can protect individuals in high-stress and demanding roles. Additionally, we recommend future research investigates compassion-focused interventions as part of institutional efforts to manage workplace stress and help ameliorate burnout in high-risk professional groups.

This research aimed to examine a theoretical model that state boredom leads to a motivation to seek meaningfulness, which promotes the engagement of social comparison. We conducted six studies to test our hypothesis. Study 1a, Study 1b, and Study 2 found that state boredom increased social comparison preference. Study 3 promoted ecological validity by adopting actual social comparison information-seeking behavior. Meanwhile, an alternative explanation that state boredom increased information preference regardless of content was ruled out. Study 4 verified motivation to seek meaningfulness as the psychological mechanism underlying the effect and found that people with different self-construals differed in the amount of increase in the sense of meaningfulness obtained from social comparison. Study 5 adopted a moderation-of-process design to further verify the mediating role of motivation to seek meaningfulness. In conclusion, our findings reveal the impact of state boredom on social comparison and its underlying mechanisms, which contributes to the further understanding of state boredom.

Anxiety symptoms is prevalent among college students and is associated with a range of detrimental consequences. Self-compassion and emotion regulation difficulties are important factors affecting anxiety symptoms, but their functional mechanism and longitudinal correlation are still unclear. This three-year longitudinal study (baseline:n= 5785, 48.2% of female,Mage= 18.63 years,SD= 0.88; T1to T5:n= range from 4312 to 5497) aimed to validate the emotion regulation model of self-compassion by examining the associations between self-compassion, emotion regulation difficulties, and anxiety symptoms. Random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) was used to distinguish within-person variations overtime from stable between-person differences. The results obtained from the RI-CLPMs indicated that there is a bidirectional effect between self-compassion and anxiety symptoms at the within-person level. Emotional regulation difficulties played a longitudinal mediating role in the prediction from self-compassion to anxiety symptoms at the within-person level, validating the emotion regulation model of self-compassion. The current study indicates that cultivating self-compassion in college students is crucial as it can improve their emotion regulation skills and alleviate anxiety symptoms.

Two main ways to enter a marriage are through free choice and through an arrangement between families, known as an arranged marriage. In this study, we compared differences in three dimensions of love (Intimacy, Passion, and Commitment) between spouses in love-based marriages and arranged marriages among five non-Western societies: Bhotiya from the Himalayas, Igbo from Nigeria, Kimeru from Kenya, Meru from Tanzania, and Tsimane’ from Bolivia. When considering all data gathered from the five cultures, free choice and arranged marriages did not differ significantly in average love scores. However, within cultures, some differences did emerge between free choice and arranged marriages, such as spouses from free choice marriages from Bhotiya and Tsimane’ culture showing higher levels of Intimacy than those from arranged marriages. However, in the Bhotiya, this difference was only evident in marriages lasting longer than 10 years. Moreover, spouses from free choice marriages from Bhotiya reported higher levels of passion, while spouses from free choice marriages from Tsimane’ reported higher levels of commitment than individuals from arranged marriages. Conversely, wives from arranged marriages from Meru culture from Tanzania reported higher levels of Intimacy and Passion as compared to wives from free choice marriages. In Kimeru and Igbo, no significant differences were found. These results contribute to the growing body of literature on the relationship between culture, love, and marriage. Our data also challenge the Western perception that arranged marriages lack love.

Although numerous studies have investigated the psychological outcomes of peer victimization, little is known about differences in the negative effects of traditional victimization and cyber victimization, especially among left-behind and non-left-behind adolescents in rural China. We aimed to examine a model explaining how traditional victimization and cyber victimization influence suicidal ideation mediated by emotional distress in rural China, with left-behind status as a moderator. Data were collected via random, multistage, stratified-cluster sampling in schools in a rural region of Hunan province, China. The sample included 697 adolescents in Grades 7–9 (boys = 53.8%). Structural equation modeling and multigroup comparison analysis were performed to test a pre-formulated conceptual model. In the full sample, both traditional and cyber victimization were associated with students’ emotional distress, which was also associated with suicidal ideation. Among left-behind adolescents, only traditional victimization was associated with emotional distress and suicidal ideation. For non-left-behind adolescents, both traditional victimization and cyber victimization were significantly associated with emotional distress, and cyber victimization’s association with emotional distress was even slightly stronger than traditional victimization’s. Our study expands the current understanding of the differential effects of traditional and cyber victimization among subgroups of children. The findings further suggest that the focus should not be solely on left-behind children; the psychological health of non-left-behind children also warrants attention. Additionally, the study provides considerable implications for practice.

Background and ObjectiveWorkplace sexual harassment (WSH) has become a serious and widespread workplace problem. One of the reasons why sexual harassment (SH) remains a challenging problem is that it is under-reported. In this study, we review the existing qualitative research surrounding this phenomenon in all workplaces, paying particular attention to barriers to reporting WSH.DesignQualitative meta-synthesis.Data SourcesDatabases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were searched to identify qualitative studies. Only articles published in English were eligible for inclusion criteria; however, no time limit was imposed. The primary data analysis included people’s experiences of reporting SH and its barriers in the workplace. Data collection was conducted from February 2023 to September 2023.MethodsThis meta-synthesis was conducted following three steps: (i) identifying published articles for inclusion and exclusion criteria, (ii) quality appraisal and data extraction, and (iii) summarizing and synthesis.ResultsThe search retrieved 6065 articles, and based on the current research question and selection criteria, a total of 237 full texts were selected to enter the research. Eventually, 44 articles were selected based on the PRISMA (2020) method. Five factors were identified as barriers to reporting WSH: uncertainty of receiving legal support from the organization, the influence of reporting on employment conditions, lack of support from people around, being worried about tarnishing the social image, and internal inhibitors.ConclusionUnderstanding the experiences of women and men who are victims of WSH can help employers, managers, and all those who are somehow involved in improving the safety of the workplace. We found that regardless of what culture people belong to, they have common experiences in reporting SH. Establishing specific rules and protocols, monitoring their implementation, and raising awareness among employees and managers through training may help reduce incidents of WSH to some extent.

Teachers are leaving the profession at a staggering rate. This is especially true for teachers of students with emotional and behavioral disorders. By targeting students’ social and emotional skills, teachers could see major improvements in student behavior. However, teachers lack adequate preservice training and ongoing professional development in behavioral management and are therefore underequipped to manage behavioral challenges, leading to higher stress and affecting attrition. One proposed remedy is better instructional supports for teachers in the classroom. In this commentary we outline the current challenges surrounding the provision of quality social and emotional instruction in schools. We argue that teachers need access to comprehensive, structured programs to provide individualized instruction on social and emotional skills. Results of a pilot study are shared, and future directions are explored.

Occupational burnout is a concern for the health of clergy and musicians and the longevity of their careers. However, no known study has assessed occupational burnout among pastoral musicians in the United States. Therefore, the aims of this paper were to (1) describe pastoral musicians as a population, (2) identify the prevalence rate of burnout among pastoral musicians, and (3) investigate the relationship between pastoral musicians’ burnout and religious coping. In 2021, an online questionnaire designed to assess burnout among pastoral musicians was disseminated via email to members of the Hymn Society of North America and via social media to collect data from pastoral music directors in the United States. The survey yieldedN= 1,050 respondents. Of these, 83.8% experienced one or more symptoms of burnout (41.3% with low efficacy; 12.4% with high emotional exhaustion; 21.3% with high cynicism; 8.8% with burnout). Ineffectiveness was positively correlated with negative religious coping. Emotional exhaustion and cynicism were positively correlated with negative religious coping. This study contributes quantitative analysis to pastoral musician research. Findings demonstrate that burnout is prevalent among American pastoral musicians. More research is needed to investigate solutions for burnout among this population.Keywords: church musician, performance-related health problems (PRHPs), clergy, musicians’ health, performing arts health, burnout.

The extant research has primarily investigated the negative effect of differentiated empowering leadership (DEL) on either the individual or team-level outcomes, revealing little about the positive influence of DEL and rarely considering the dual-level effects. According to the legitimacy perspective, the performance basis is identified as a crucial factor in enabling DEL to confer benefits to the entire team and individual members simultaneously. Furthermore, the boundary effects of team-member exchange (TMX) and employee self-efficacy on the moderating process were examined. The cross-hierarchy and hierarchical regression methods were employed to analyze the multisource data from 78 Chinese teams. The findings revealed that (1) for the effect on the whole team, DEL was positively related to team identification when highly based on employee job performance, and the effect was stronger in the team with higher-quality team-member exchange; (2) for the effect on individual members, the relation between performance-based DEL and employee work engagement was positive for the high self-efficacy members but negative for the low self-efficacy members. These findings underscore the importance of DEL basis, team, and individual contexts for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of DEL.

Parental overprotection is thought to be a risk factor for childhood anxiety disorders. The Parental Overprotection Measure (POM) is a self-assessment scale that has been used in many studies, however, no article has comprehensively explored its psychometric properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the POM to secure reliable, replicable, and comparable results. Using an item-response theoretical framework, we aimed to address five basic criteria of psychometric quality: one-dimensionality, ordered response categories, invariance, targeting, and reliability. Furthermore, we aimed to identify and exclude any items that did not contribute significantly, to create a concise and practical scale. A total of 1092 parents of children aged 4–12 years were recruited through an online advertisement and completed an anonymous online survey during September and October 2020. Out of the 19 items of the original scale, eight were excluded due to unsatisfactory psychometric properties and/or because of not being judged by experts as harmonious with the concept of parental overprotection. The retained items constituted the POM-11, a brief scale with sound psychometric properties that has the potential for use in both research and clinical settings.

The mechanism by which awe promotes prosocial behavior remains to be clarified. Elucidating this issue can expand the theory of positive emotion extension and increase the explanatory paths of awe’s influence on prosocial behavior. Study1 and Study 2 employ experimental methods to reveal the predictive effect of state awe on prosocial behavior and the mediating role of psychological resilience; Study 3 used correlational research to explore the relationship between trait awe and prosocial behavior and its underlying mechanism. The results indicated that both state awe and trait awe positively predicted prosocial behavior.Furthermore, psychological resilience served as a mediator between state/trait awe and prosocial behavior. These findings suggest that state /trait awe can both directly predict prosocial behavior and indirectly influence prosocial behavior through the mediating role of psychological resilience. Psychological resilience played a significant role in the process by which the experience of awe promotes individuals’ prosocial behavior. This study helps to reveal the potential mechanism of awe enhancing prosocial behavior, which has important practical value for the harmonious development of society.

Positive peer interactions are critical for adolescent development and well-being. Showing little interest in interacting socially with peers and/or extracting little reward from positive peer interactions can be markers of social anhedonia, which impacts many youths, especially girls, with social anxiety and depressive disorders. Reduced interest or reward in peer interactions may contribute to social anxiety and depression in girls through effects on positive affect (PA), though associations between social anhedonia and momentary PA have yet to be tested. The present study used ecological momentary assessment to test such associations between real-world anticipatory social reward (i.e., interest in upcoming peer events), consummatory social reward (i.e., reward extracted from positive peer interactions), and momentary PA in a sample of 129 girls (aged 11–13 years) who were oversampled for high shy/fearful temperament, a risk factor for future social anxiety and depression. Girls reported higher PA following a more socially rewarding peer interaction, and higher PA on days they reported higher anticipatory social reward. Exploratory analyses showed that these associations were specific to PA; neither anticipatory nor consummatory social reward was associated with changes in negative affect. Findings may inform the development of clinical interventions that target social anhedonia to modify PA in youth with affective disorders.

As a wide variety of intelligent technologies become part of everyday life, researchers have explored how people conceptualize agents that in some ways act and think like living things but are clearly machines. Much of this work draws upon the idea that people readily default to generalizing human-like properties to such agents, and only pare back on these generalizations with added thought. However, recent findings have also documented that people are sometimes initially hesitant to attribute minds to a machine but are more willing to do so with additional thought. In the current experiments, we hypothesized that these attribution-increasing reconsiderations could be spurred by situation-induced cognitive dissonance. In two experiments, participants completed a belief activation exercise designed to induce cognitive dissonance (writing arguments for or against prominent beliefs), viewed a video of an ambiguously intentional robot, and completed measures of cognitive dissonance. In both experiments, cognitive dissonance was associated with increased attributions of mind to the robot. Our findings provide evidence that people sometimes increase their attributions of minds when experiencing cognitive conflict, but also that activation of change-inducing concepts may impact attributions of a mind without producing conscious cognitive conflict in participants.

Understanding the neuroanatomy of schizophrenia remains elusive due to heterogeneous findings across neuroimaging studies. Here we investigated whether patterns of brain atrophy associated with schizophrenia would localize to a common brain network using a coordinate network mapping meta-analysis approach. Utilizing the human connectome as a wiring diagram, we identified a connectivity pattern, a schizophrenia network, uniting heterogeneous results from 90 published studies of atrophy in schizophrenia (totaln> 8,000). This network was specific to schizophrenia, differentiating it from atrophy in individuals at high risk for psychosis (n= 3,038), normal aging (n= 4,195), neurodegenerative disorders (n= 3,707) and other psychiatric conditions (n= 3,432). The network was also stable with disease progression and across different clusters of schizophrenia symptoms. Patterns of brain atrophy in schizophrenia were negatively correlated with lesions linked to psychosis-related thought processes in an independent cohort (n= 181). Our results propose a unique, stable, and unified schizophrenia network, addressing a significant portion of the heterogeneity observed in previous atrophy studies.

Interpersonal and intergroup relationships seem to have steadily deteriorated in recent years, with an increase in the lack of civility and decency along with a greater willingness to attack and cancel anyone who does not agree with one’s cherished perspective on numerous matters. New popular phrases such as cancel culture, public shaming, air rage, and gaslighting have entered the common vernacular. Ignatian spirituality offers several helpful strategies for dealing with these contemporary divisive conflicts in a productive manner. These include (1) seeing God (or the sacred) in all things, (2) striving towards kinship with others through the pathway of civility, hospitality, and solidarity, and (3) managing conflict with accommodation, humility, and the expectation of goodness in mind. This article introduces and provides examples of these three Ignatian principles that can be employed in all challenging relationships, including both personal and professional as well as psychotherapeutic ones. They can be utilized in a secular or spiritually minded manner as well. Having more tools to improve relationships is especially needed now.

The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between the victim-perpetrator educational gap and the type of violence exerted within a sample of perpetrators, as well as to explore whether this relationship is mediated by distorted thoughts about women, attitudes toward the use of violence, and empathy. A total of 466 men convicted of an intimate partner violence-related crime were divided into two groups: Group EL < V (perpetrators with a lower educational level than the victim) and Group EL > V (perpetrators with a higher educational level than the victim). Mediation analyses were conducted using distorted thoughts about women, attitudes toward violence, and empathy as mediators. Perpetrators with a lower educational level than their partner exerted greater physical, psychological, and sexual violence compared to those with a higher educational level, but only when mediated by distorted thoughts about women and empathy. These findings have significant implications for both intervention programs and prevention strategies.

Objectives: A network analysis was used to examine the relationship between childhood abuse and Machiavellian traits in different genders. This has not been done before. Methods: The study recruited Chinese university students; 1,285 students completed questionnaires measuring childhood abuse and Machiavellianism. Network analysis was done using R Studio. Results: The results of the study indicate that 75.9% of participants abused met the criteria for one type of child abuse. Two examined constructs (i.e., childhood abuse and Machiavellianism) were interconnected in the females’ and males’ networks. The results showed negative relationships between physical neglect/ emotional neglect and desire for status (PN-Dst, EN-Dst), and a positive correlation between emotional abuse and desire for status (EA-Stt) in both genders. Unique to female networks is the link between emotional abuse and distrust (EA-Dst), while physical neglect was associated with distrust (PN-Dst) in females and with control (PN-Cnt) in males. Sexual/ physical abuse was related to control desire (SA-Cnt, PA-Cnt) in females only. The link between amorality and emotional abuse or neglect (EA-Amr, EN-Amr) was showed in females. In contrast, amorality in males is associated with physical abuse (PA-Amr). Conclusion: The results demonstrate the utility of a network approach in modeling the correlational structure of childhood abuse and Machiavellianism. It identifies key factors and communities within the network while also measuring the strength and direction of symptom ties, and provides novel insights into gender differences.

Despite long-standing concerns about the use of free reaction times (RTs) in cognitive psychology, they remain a prevalent measure of conflict resolution. This report presents the forced-response method as a fresh approach to examine speed–accuracy trade-off functions (SATs) in conflict tasks. The method involves fixing the overall response time, varying the onset of stimuli, and observing response expression. We applied this method to an arrow flanker task. By systematically varying the time between stimulus onset and response, we reveal a comprehensive time course of the flanker interference effect that is rarely observed in previous literature. We further show that influential manipulations observed in free-RT paradigms similarly affect accuracy within the forced-response technique, suggesting that the forced-response method retains the core cognitive processing characteristics of traditional free-RT conflict tasks. As a behavioral method that examines the time course of cognitive processing, the forced-response method provides a novel and more nuanced look into the dynamics of conflict resolution.

Eye tracking technology has become increasingly prevalent in scientific research, offering unique insights into oculomotor and cognitive processes. The present article explores the relationship between scientific theory, the research question, and the use of eye-tracking technology. It aims to guide readers in determining if eye tracking is suitable for their studies and how to formulate relevant research questions. Examples from research on oculomotor control, reading, scene perception, task execution, visual expertise, and instructional design are used to illustrate the connection between theory and eye-tracking data. These examples may serve as inspiration to researchers new to eye tracking. In summarizing the examples, three important considerations emerge: (1) whether the study focuses on describing eye movements or uses them as a proxy for e.g., perceptual, or cognitive processes, (2) the logical chain from theory to predictions, and (3) whether the study is of an observational or idea-testing nature. We provide a generic scheme and a set of specific questions that may help researchers formulate and explicate their research question using eye tracking.

The use of research-informed and evidence-based practices (RI/EBPs) in classroom and behavior management can help teachers mitigate challenging student behavior in their classrooms, while also improving the academic achievement for those students. However, research suggests teachers lack the knowledge and skills to implement these practices. The purpose of this study was to gain insight of one mid-Atlantic school districts (1) access, preparation, and training in the use of RI/EBPs in classroom and behavior management and (2) the experiences of their teachers with RI/EBPs in classroom and behavior management. Data were analyzed based on a cross-sectional survey design. Results indicated participants had limited access, preparation, and training in RI/EBPs in classroom and behavior management; however, some variation did occur. In addition, results were promising relative to our participants’ experiences with RI/EBPs in classroom and behavior management. Limitations, implications for future research, and implications for practice are discussed.

Autonomy-supportive parenting benefits adolescents’ psychosocial adjustment, but daily fluctuations in adolescent difficulties and parenting stress can reduce autonomy support and lead to more controlling practices. However, currently it is not yet well understood why some parents seem better able to deal with the daily upheavals characteristic of adolescence, while other parents may resort to controlling practices. To address this gap, the present studies examined the moderating role of parental reflective functioning (i.e., parents’ capacity to understand their adolescent’s behavior in terms of mental states) in the daily relationships between adolescent difficulties, parental stress, and autonomy-supportive or controlling parenting. Two 7-day diary studies were conducted, of which Study 1 involved 220 parents of early adolescents (Mage= 13.05 years,SD= 0.87, range 10–15, 66% female) and Study 2 involved 161 parents of middle adolescents (Mage= 15.56 years,SD= 1.14, range = 13–18, 61.5% female). Multilevel analyses indicated that daily perceived externalizing difficulties and parental stress were associated with less autonomy-supportive and more controlling parenting. Furthermore, prementalizing (i.e., attributing malevolent intentions to adolescents) predicted less autonomy support and more controlling parenting. Greater interest and curiosity about adolescents’ mental states buffered the associations between middle adolescents’ (internalizing and externalizing) difficulties and parent-reported controlling parenting. These findings highlight the role of both parent and adolescent characteristics in day-to-day parenting fluctuations and underscore the importance of parental reflective functioning in understanding variations in autonomy-supportive and controlling practices.

We explore the intricate associations among job insecurity, psychological contract breach (PCB), job stress, ethical leadership, and pro-environmental behavior at work (PEBW) within South Korean organizations. Using a 4-wave time-lagged design and data from 220 employees of South Korean companies, analyzed through structural equation modeling, the research investigates how job insecurity impacts PEBW via the sequential mediating role of PCB and job stress. Additionally, it examines the moderating role of ethical leadership within this context. The findings reveal that job insecurity significantly increases psychological contract breach, which subsequently elevates job stress and ultimately reduces PEBW. These results highlight the necessity of addressing job insecurity to prevent negative impacts on employee attitudes and behaviors. Moreover, the study demonstrates that ethical leadership effectively buffers the detrimental influences of unstable jobs on PCB, emphasizing the significance of ethical leadership in building a supportive and trusting environment. The study contributes to the theoretical discourse by integrating insights from Social Exchange Theory, Conservation of Resources theory, the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Equity Theory, and leadership theories, thereby providing a comprehensive perspective to understand the antecedents of PEBW. Practically, the results provide actionable perspectives for organizations aiming to enhance sustainability. By mitigating job insecurity, managing psychological contract breaches and job stress, and fostering ethical leadership, organizations can enhance employee engagement in pro-environmental behaviors. Overall, this research offers significant theoretical and practical contributions, providing a nuanced understanding of how job insecurity affects PEBW and informing strategies to cultivate a sustainable organizational environment.

At an early age, humans learn words to communicate their affective states and generalize their identification across differing external conditions. One might call this collection of effects emotion labeling. Previous research investigating analogous effects in nonverbal animal models has largely used drug-induced affective states or metacognitive states that are difficult to control. Some progress has been made by conceptualizing affect as a point within a two-dimensional space with pleasure on one axis and arousal on the other. Distinct affective states may thus serve as cues that control both human and non-human behavior. If conditions supporting responding produce distinct affect, labeling in one circumstance may transfer to novel conditions that elicit the same affective state. The present experiment examined the labeling of affective states induced in pigeons via outcomes of either the delivery of food or its omission. These outcomes followed responses (pecks) made in the presence of three visual stimuli (A,B, andC). OnAtrials, each outcome was followed by two labels; pecks to one of two labels, depending on whether food was delivered or omitted, were required to progress to the next trial. All pigeons labeled accurately. Consistent with human emotion labeling, pigeons learned to select a label associated with different core affect-inducing outcomes, transferred appropriately to novel conditions (i.e., trials withBandCin Test 1 and 2), and probably relied on more than just external cues (Test 3).

IntroductionResearch from sub-Saharan Africa has shown that women’s relationships and partners influence their contraceptive use. Most relevant studies focus on relationship status with few considering how the quality of a relationship might influence women’s use of contraceptives. This study is the first to examine how both positive and negative relationship dynamics are associated with young women’s modern contraceptive use among those who want to postpone pregnancy for at least 2 years or stop childbearing altogether.MethodsWe analyze survey data collected in 2010 and 2011 from 745 young women aged 16–26 in partnerships in southern Malawi. The data include positive relationship dynamics such as expressions of love, communication, and partner support (relationship unity) and negative dynamics including unequal power and intimate partner violence.ResultsLogistic regression models show that relationship unity is significantly and positively associated with modern contraceptive use whereas negative relationship dynamics are not associated with contraceptive use among the sample. When stratified by relationship status, model results show the effects are driven by unmarried women.ConclusionsResults suggest that positive relationship dynamics among unmarried couples can facilitate modern contraceptive use among those who want to avoid pregnancy.Policy ImplicationsEfforts to encourage partner communication and support surrounding the use of contraception, and expanding access to a variety of modern methods, may be beneficial for reducing unintended pregnancies and enhancing unmarried young women’s reproductive autonomy to meet their contraceptive and fertility desires.

This study applied intergroup contact theory to explore professional counselors’ attitudes toward diversity and the influence of intergroup interactions on their professional practice. Using a transcendental phenomenological approach, the qualitative analysis, consisting of interviews across eight participants, identified six key themes: personal growth, professional development, impact of intergroup contact, advocacy and social justice, influence of graduate training programs, and strategies for effective intergroup contact. The findings highlight the need for counselor education programs to integrate structured intergroup contact experiences to enhance multicultural competence among trainees. Recommendations for educators include incorporating diverse social interactions and experiential learning opportunities within training programs to foster positive attitudes toward diversity and improve counseling effectiveness.

Educational programs in which people are exposed to counter-stereotypical role models are often used for breaking gender stereotypes. Most gender role-model interventions focus on adolescents and emerging adults. Yet, middle childhood might be a highly effective period for changing gender stereotypes because children are still learning about gender and gender roles. Hence, in this mixed-methods study aformative evaluation was conducted on the usability and acceptability of a new educational program (Heroines!) with diverse counter-stereotypical female heroines that was developed for children aged 6–12 years. Ten Dutch teachers (90% women) who utilized the Heroines program in their classes completed the System Usability Scale and were interviewed (semi-structured) on several indicators of usability and acceptability. Overall, the usability and acceptability of the Heroines program was high according to teachers both in the survey and the interviews. Perceived effectiveness, users’ affective attitudes, perceived burden, and ethicality were evaluated most positively. Intervention coherence and teacher self-efficacy were evaluated somewhat lower. The program also elicited some resistance among boys because of its sole focus on women. To conclude, to increase intervention coherence and teacher’s self-efficacy for working with the intervention, it is recommended to create a clear link between the central character traits of the heroines and the traits that are practiced by children in the accompanying exercises. In order to increase acceptability of the program for boys teachers need to explain the importance of the focus on female role models.

ObjectivesThe positive relationship between dispositional mindfulness and pro-environmental behaviour has been often attributed to increased ecological concern and behavioural regulation. However, research on how mindfulness might influence pro-environmental behaviour via enhanced emotional regulation remains scarce, even though existing studies suggest that negative emotions can hinder adaptive responses to environmental crises, especially when such emotions disrupt daily functioning. The current study investigated the dynamics of the relationship between dispositional mindfulness, climate change anxiety, and pro-environmental behaviour, in the hypothesis that mindfulness may contribute to predict pro-environmental behaviour by encouraging a more adaptive coping strategy facing the threat of climate change.MethodTwo hundred and sixty-six adults participated in a correlational study and completed self-report measures assessing mindfulness, climate change anxiety, and pro-environmental behaviour, along with several control variables.ResultsThe results of our study revealed that mindfulness skills have a dual effect on the relationship between climate change anxiety and pro-environmental behaviour. At high levels, nonreacting weakened the positive relationship between the cognitive impairment dimension of climate change anxiety and pro-environmental behaviour. Meanwhile, both observing and nonreacting significantly moderated the relationship between the functional impairment dimension of climate change anxiety and pro-environmental behaviour, which became positive in presence of such mindfulness facets.ConclusionsThe outcomes of our investigation offer initial indications of the involvement of dispositional mindfulness in influencing the relationship between climate change anxiety and pro-environmental behaviour. However, this influence manifests in different ways. Whilst mindfulness enhances engagement in pro-environmental behaviour in case of more severe forms of climate change anxiety, it also reduces the motivational drive associated with milder forms of climate change anxiety.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.

Despite self-reported positive explicit attitudes toward mixed-sex couples with Down Syndrome (DS), impacts of socially desirable responding have been a concern for researchers. Thus, the current study investigated variations in implicit and explicit attitudes toward mixed-sex couples with and without DS, impacts of socially desirable responding, and how perceptions of personhood (i.e., the extent to which those with DS are just as ‘human’ as those without). accounted for variations in these attitudes. College students (N =261) were instructed to complete an Implicit Association Test (IAT) and measures of explicit attitudes, socially desirable responding, and personhood perception Results revealed a slight implicit preference toward those without DS over those with DS (DIAT= -0.20), and implicit measures depicted more bias than did explicit measures. Perceptions of personhood were positively correlated with both implicit and explicit attitudes, however, social desirability did not significantly moderate this relationship. Results from this study have important implications for personhood-centered interventions that could potentially reduce stigma and promote increased autonomy for anyone with DS in romantic relationship engagement.

According to Buffer Effect Model, social support is considered a coping strategy in the presence of a stressful situation. This study investigates the link between pregnant women's psychological well-being, cognitive emotion regulation strategies, and partner support, by using buffer effect model. There were 256 Turkish pregnant women in the sample. The Personal Information Form, Partner Support Scale (PSS), Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EDSD), Cognitive Emotion Regulation Scale (CERS), Beck Anxiety Scale (BAI), and Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWBS) used by study participants to collect sociodemographic and pregnancy-related data. Correlation analysis, t-test, anova and bootstrap methods were used. Pregnant women who are at risk of depression, according to the data, score higher on anxiety but lower on psychological well-being and spousal support (p< .05). Women with significant anxiety score higher on depression and have worse psychological well-being and spousal support ratings than women without anxiety (p< .05). Planning refocus and positive reappraisal strategies provide a significant mediating role in the relationship between psychological well-being and marital support. Significant impacts were reported when spousal support became a coping mechanism for pregnant women in several elements of their psychological well-being. The results acquired might aid in the creation of therapeutic and preventative intervention programs in the field of mental health.

Aside from some common movement regularities, significant inter-individual and inter-trial variation within the same individual exists in motor system output. However, there is still a lack of a robust and widely adopted solution for quantifying the degree of similarity between movements. We therefore developed an innovative approach based on the Procrustes transformation to compute 'motor distance' between pairs of kinematic data. As a proof of concept, we tested this on a dataset of reach-to-grasp movements performed by 16 participants while acting with the same confederate. Using the information of wrist velocity, acceleration, and jerk, the proposed technique was able to correctly estimate smaller distances between movements performed by the confederate compared with those of participants. Moreover, the reconstructed pattern of inter-subject distances was consistent when computed either on precision grip prehension or whole hand prehension, suggesting its suitability for the investigation of 'motor styles'. The definition of a solid approach to 'motor distance' computation, therefore, opens the way to new research lines in the field of movement kinematics.

Processing fluency, which describes the subjective sensation of ease with which information is processed by the sensory systems and the brain, has become one of the most popular explanations of aesthetic appreciation and beauty. Two metrics have recently been proposed to model fluency: the sparsity of neuronal activation, which describes the concentration of activity in a subset of neurons, and the statistical typicality of activations, which describes how well the encoding of a stimulus matches a reference representation of stimuli of the category to which it belongs. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a model for the human visual system, this study compares the ability of these metrics to explain variation in facial attractiveness. Our findings show that the sparsity of neuronal activations is a more robust predictor of facial attractiveness than statistical typicality. Refining the reference representation to a single ethnicity or gender does not increase the explanatory power of statistical typicality. However, statistical typicality and sparsity predict facial beauty based on different layers of the CNNs, suggesting that they describe different neural mechanisms underlying fluency.

We aimed to understand the long-term impact of negative life events  on epigenetic aging in 1783 adults from the Netherlands Twin Register, analyzing five epigenetic biomarkers (Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, GrimAge, DunedinPACE) and a series of negative life events, including victimization and economic hardship. In population-level analyses, associations between a higher number of negative life events (particularly financial adversities, sexual crimes, and job loss) were seen for the GrimAge biomarker. The association between the number of negative life events and financial problems and epigenetic age acceleration measured by the GrimAge biomarker persisted after adjusting for BMI, smoking, and white blood cell counts. In monozygotic twin pairs discordant for negative life events (263 pairs) the associations were diminished, indicating that the population associations may be confounded by shared familial (genetic and environmental) factors. These findings underscore the intricate link between environmental stressors and biological aging, stressing the need for comprehensive studies considering both genetic and environmental influences.

Perfectionism is widely associated with social anxiety, yet the relationship is rarely explored with consideration to the multidimensionality of perfectionism. This study investigates the potential mediating effects of the bivalent fear of evaluation (BFOE) model on the relationship between perfectionism dimensions and social anxiety, a construct that proposes the importance of both fear of negative evaluation and fear of positive evaluation in social anxiety. Our research involved 435 university students who completed a large battery of measures as part of a prior study. The results demonstrated that irrespective of valence, fear of evaluation partially mediated a positive relationship between perfectionistic concerns over mistakes and doubts about action and social anxiety, and parental pressures and social anxiety. Additionally, in line with the BFOE model, both valences of fear of evaluation partially mediated a negative indirect effect between perfectionistic order and social anxiety. In contrast, perfectionistic personal standards demonstrated a non-significant bivariate relationship with social anxiety. The study supports the BFOE model and contributes to a deeper understanding of the association between dimensions of perfectionism and social anxiety.

This methodological paper examines the assessment of interpersonal synchrony during a joint dancing task between mothers and their children (aged 4 to 5 years) using OpenPose. This pose estimation tool captures movement in naturalistic settings. The study analyzes 45 mother–child dyads, comparing two analytical methods for assessing synchrony, and examines their correlation with the Coding Interactive Behavior (CIB) measure of interaction quality. The first method employs cross-wavelet transform (CWT) coherence to assess synchrony based on vertical head movement. This straightforward and computationally efficient approach reveals a significant correlation between interpersonal synchrony and CIB scores, thus implying its potential as a reliable indicator of interaction quality and suggesting its potential as a measure of interaction quality. The second method, the generalized cross-wavelet transform (GCWT), analyzes synchrony across multiple body parts, offering a more complex and detailed analysis of interpersonal dynamics. However, it did not significantly correlate with the CIB scores. Our findings suggest that focusing on head movement using CWT can effectively capture critical elements of interpersonal synchrony linked to interaction quality. In contrast, despite its richness, the more complex GCWT approach may not align as closely with observed interactive behaviors as the CIB scores indicate. This study underscores the need to balance methodological complexity and ecological validity in research, offering insights into selecting analytical techniques based on research objectives and the nuances of interpersonal dynamics. Our results contribute to the field of interpersonal synchrony research, emphasizing the benefits of efficient methods in understanding mother–child interactions and interaction relationships in general.

Recent studies have examined the role and functionality of regulating emotions in academic settings. The main purpose of this study was to explore how various strategies can regulate students’ negative emotions in receiving feedback and challenges in argumentative writing. To formulate this line of research, we employed a multiple case design, using multiple sources of data including a semi-structured interview, narrative inquiry, and diaries to examine how Iranian EFL M.A students regulate their emotions in argumentative writing tasks. The holistic view of findings revealed that students experienced a large range of emotions while receiving feedback and challenges during argumentative writing. As the findings displayed, at the beginning of the course the participants had negative feelings such as shame, disappointment, low self-confidence, and stress which brought about using different strategies to regulate their emotions. These strategies were categorized into three themes: acceptance, cognitive reappraisal, and problem-solving. Besides, not only emotion regulation strategies (ERS) as an internal factor have a great influence on students’ mindsets, but also one external factor known as writing instructor was effective in regulating students’ emotions. The implications and recommendations for ERS are discussed.

This randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of an online autism training intervention in reducing stigma toward autistic individuals. Participants were 208 Korean undergraduate students who were blinded to group allocation, with 106 assigned to the autism training and 102 assigned to a control intervention. All participants completed an online Qualtrics survey that included a pre-test survey (perceived similarity to different minority groups), the training, and a post-test survey (perceived similarity, stigma toward autistic people, knowledge about autism, confidence in their knowledge, and open-responses question asking for descriptions of autism). We conducted independent samplettests and a mixed-effects model to examine group-level differences, and a reliable change index (RCI) analysis to examine individual changes in the perceived similarity score. The responses to the open-ended questions were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results revealed that the experimental group reported reduced stigma toward autistic individuals, increased perceived similarity with autistic individuals, and increased confidence in their autism knowledge and demonstrated increased knowledge about autism compared to the control group. At the individual level, the RCI analysis indicated that the training was effective for a notable subset of participants (25%). At post-test, the experimental group recognized the strengths of autistic people and described autistic individuals as “people like us,” while many in the control group mentioned misconceptions about autism. Future research should employ more robust intervention designs and tailor materials for diverse target populations, including administrators, to foster systemic destigmatization.

This study examined the psychometric properties of self-rated symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD). We analyzed symptom ratings from a clinical outpatient sample of 658 adolescents aged 11;0–17;11 years diagnosed with ODD/CD and/or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. In two steps, we examined the factor structure of ODD models and an additional CD symptom dimension using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM). Our preferred three-factor CFA and ESEM models (CFI = 0.937–0.975, TLI = 0.926–0.962, RMSEA = 0.049–0.068, SRMR = 0.045–0.070) demonstrated scalar measurement invariance across age groups (≥ 14;0 years) and metric measurement invariance across informants (parents, teachers). With exceptions, the self-rated symptom scales showed acceptable internal consistencies (α = 0.68–0.84). Convergent (r=.27–.65) and divergent validity (r=.13–.41) were supported using Achenbach’s Youth Self Report Form. Our results provide implications for using self-rated ODD/CD symptoms in clinical practice and research.

Anxiety sensitivity may be associated with both anxiety and eating disorder symptoms, which could contribute to the frequent comorbidity of both syndromes. This study examined the common (i.e., correlated) genetic and environmental contributions to anxiety sensitivity, cognitive symptoms of eating disorder severity, and anxiety symptoms to understand their co-occurrence in adolescence. This study analyzed data from the Twins Early Development Study. When twins were 16 years old (N = 5,111 pairs), they self-reported anxiety sensitivity via the Child Anxiety Sensitivity Index and cognitive symptoms of eating disorder severity via four items from the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale. Parents reported adolescent anxiety symptoms via the Anxiety Related Behaviour Questionnaire. Common genetic and non-shared environmental factors contributed to phenotypic correlations among cognitive symptoms of eating disorders. Genetic and nonshared environmental influences contributed to anxiety sensitivity and a latent variable of cognitive symptoms of eating disorder severity. Genetic, shared-, and nonshared- environmental influences contributed to anxiety symptoms. Common genetic and nonshared environmental influences contributed to anxiety sensitivity and anxiety symptoms, as well as anxiety sensitivity and cognitive symptoms of eating disorder severity. However, there was no evidence of common genetic or environmental contributions to anxiety symptoms and cognitive symptoms of eating disorder severity. This study implicates anxiety sensitivity as a potential cognitive process associated with both anxiety symptoms and cognitive symptoms of eating disorders.

As of 2021, 1.3 billion people globally live with disabilities, with 80% in low-and-middle-income countries and 12.8% in Africa. Women with disabilities often face gender-based discrimination and limited sexual autonomy, impacting their sexual health. Despite global progress, there is limited research on the sexuality of women with disabilities in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Nigeria. This study explores the sexual experiences of women with disabilities in Lagos, Nigeria. Using a qualitative approach, 24 women with disabilities, including blindness and mobility impairments, were interviewed to understand their experiences with sexual activity, autonomy, contraceptive use, risky behaviors, and sexual violence. The participants demographic shows that 67% of participants had physical disabilities, while 33% had visual impairments, with ages ranging from 20 to 45 and varying education and employment levels. Themes were generated around the experience of women with disabilities in sexual activities, modern contraceptive use, sexual autonomy, risky sexual behavior and sexual violence. Many participants did not see their disabilities as hindering sexual activity but faced challenges in relationships due to physical limitations and societal stigma. The study found mixed experiences with modern contraceptives, hindered by misconceptions and accessibility issues, and some women reported experiencing sexual violence and inadequate access to reproductive health resources and support. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, including improved access to contraceptives, public education to reduce stigma, and enhanced legal protections to support the sexual and reproductive health of women with disabilities in Lagos.

To systematically review the existing literature on the efficacy of psychological interventions aimed at improving the sexual health of stroke survivors. A database search was conducted at MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science, EBSCO (APA PsycINFO and APA PsycArticles), and The Cochrane Library. PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. Manuscripts were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I, Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias Tool, and the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies (JBI-CACS). From an initial 1053 publications identified, five studies were included in the present study. The study designs of the selected studies included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, a cross-sectional study, and a case study. The predominant intervention model used in most studies was the PLISSIT model. No studies using a digital-delivered format were identified. This research underscores the potential benefits of tailored interventions for promoting sexual health in stroke survivors and highlights areas for future research.

Investigating internet child exploitation cases poses unique stress for investigators routinely exposed to traumatic material. We posit that this stress arises not only from exposure but also from empathy for victims' suffering, which acts as a predominant job stressor. Drawing from the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, our study examines the relationship between empathy for suffering and burnout, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), among investigators in internet child exploitation cases. We further explore how social support from colleagues moderates these effects. In an online study of 168 investigators (90 women), our findings reveal that empathy for suffering is positively correlated with PTSD and burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion and cynicism), independent of exposure. While prolonged exposure to traumatic content contributes to PTSD, empathy significantly amplifies stress. Social support from colleagues partially moderates the relationship between stressors and adverse health outcomes, serving as a crucial job resource. Our results suggest that, while exposure to disturbing material is a job hazard, empathy for suffering emerges as the predominant stressor. These findings highlight the importance of addressing both exposure and empathy in risk assessment and health promotion strategies for internet child exploitation investigators, with a focus on enhancing social support within the workplace.

Family functioning is used to evaluate the functioning of a family system, which exerts a huge influence on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). However, little is known about how family functioning relates to NSSI among adolescents, and existing research mainly depends on cross-sectional design, which cannot capture dynamic changes between variables. Additionally, NSSI urge has been established as a robust predictor of NSSI engagement and is clinically important. Guided by the integrated model of NSSI, the current study investigated two potential mediators (emotion regulation and self-esteem) of the relations between family functioning and NSSI urges to address these gaps. Participants were 1298 Chinese adolescents (50.5% male;Mage at Wave 2 = 15.08 years) from a three-wave longitudinal study with data spanning ten months. The results supported the chain multiple mediation model. Specifically, valid family functioning prevented NSSI urges through three indirect paths: (a) higher level of self-esteem; (b) more cognitive reappraisal to higher self-esteem; (c) less expressive suppression to higher self-esteem. The prediction of family functioning on cognitive reappraisal was weaker among girls, while the prediction of self-esteem on NSSI urges was stronger. These findings indicate that high family functioning is a powerful protective factor of NSSI urges, and NSSI interventions should aim to improve adolescents’ family functioning, with attention to reinforcing emotion regulation and self-esteem, especially for girls.

PurposeThere is a dearth of information about patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual disability (ID) who seek emergency psychiatric care. Given this backdrop, this retrospective study aims to explore clinical, demographic, and disposition-related information about this patient population over a 10-year period.MethodsThis study includes individuals with ASD or ID (n= 1461) and had presented to a psychiatric emergency department between 2012 and 2021. Data were extracted using a structured chart review methodology, and included demographic, clinical and visit information. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were estimated to explore associations between key variables and dispositions of interest.ResultsSample was predominantly White (77.21%), adolescent (mean age ± SD = 15.5 ± 4.3) and male (72.76%). The most common reason for their presentation was aggression towards others (36.39%). 28.27% of patients were psychiatrically hospitalized but 30% of those who needed hospitalization were discharged due to lack of inpatient bed availability.ConclusionThis study adds to the limited literature about individuals with ASD or ID seeking emergency care. The results indicate a highly acute patient population with aggression, suicidal thoughts, and self-injurious behaviors who are frequently prescribed psychotropic medications and face barriers to accessing higher levels of care.

Emotional working memory (WM) involves retaining and processing emotionally charged information, integrating emotions into cognitive tasks like decision-making and attention management. While anxiety affects dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity, research on how different anxiety levels impact WM remains inconclusive. To investigate this, participants were divided into Mild and Moderate anxiety groups based on their Beck Anxiety Inventory scores. Their performance on 2-back emotional WM task was compared both behaviorally and neurologically. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure oxyhemoglobin levels in the dlPFC. The results showed that both groups had similar performance, with no significant differences in correct responses to the spatial location of emotional face stimuli. This suggests that emotional stimuli do not affect WM performance between groups. However, imaging data revealed hemisphere-specific differences in oxyhemoglobin changes, with no significant difference between hemispheres. The Moderate anxiety group exhibited reduced oxyhemoglobin levels in the right dlPFC compared to Mild anxiety group, while no significant difference was observed in the left dlPFC. These findings indicate that the degree of anxiety in healthy individuals affects WM processes in the right dlPFC, although this differs slightly from findings comparing high and low anxiety scores in healthy or diagnosed anxiety participants. Notably, these differences did not impair WM performance when participants provided non-verbal responses. This suggests that moderate anxiety may alter the neural mechanisms underlying WM without affecting the output of non-verbal tasks. Further research is needed to understand how WM, with or without emotional components, varies between individuals with mild and moderate anxiety levels.

Research suggests that majority racial group members in the USA (i.e., White people) sometimes respond to high levels of racial out-group representation with attitudinal concerns about anti-White discrimination, particularly among those who endorse more conservative (vs. more liberal) ideology and perceive economic threats to their in-group. However, research has not yet assessed whether these variables predict actual anti-White discrimination claiming behavior at work. These claims are potentially problematic because concerns about White racial victimization are often cited as a reason to scale back policies aimed at improving racial diversity and racial justice in organizations. We investigate the effects of racial out-group representation, political ideology, and in-group economic threat on the prevalence of anti-White discrimination claims in US counties. In doing so, we contribute to scholarship examining the relationship between workplace intergroup relations and the social contexts surrounding them. We use computational methods to combine (a) a geocoded dataset of discrimination claims filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with (b) county-level data on the representation of people of color, (c) White unemployment rates, and (d) political liberalism-conservatism. Results reveal a positive relationship between the proportional representation of people of color and the proportion of claims filed for anti-White discrimination and further show that this positive association is stronger in counties with higher conservatism (vs. liberalism). This study provides the first large-scale support for the hypothesis that racial out-group representation positively relates to majority group members’ claims of racial victimization, particularly amid strong preferences to conserve the status quo.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the widespread adoption of telehealth services, yet challenges persist in providing them to socially vulnerable communities. A comprehensive understanding of the implementation challenges of digital mental health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is lacking, particularly in Brazil, where high rates of mental health impact and significant socioeconomic disparities are prevalent. Mental health platforms were developed during the pandemic, emphasising partnerships to deliver telehealth for vulnerable populations. These platforms included an online self-knowledge journey offering personalised feedback through videos, audios, and texts. Telephone interviews with 357 residents from these communities were conducted to gain insights into their interests regarding digital services. While most participants (61.9%) acknowledged the usefulness of digital mental health services, only a few (n= 15) had utilised them before, underscoring the untapped potential of telehealth for vulnerable communities. Participants showed a keen interest in apps and videos, data that must be considered when implementing telehealth services for this population. Younger participants (18–39 years old) showed a greater inclination towards digital mental health services (p< 0.001), while older adults (60 +) tended to prefer face-to-face interventions. Recommendations include tailoring digital mental health solutions for younger demographics and addressing health access disparities (e.g., through digital health literacy and hybrid approaches) among various population subgroups to facilitate effective telehealth implementation. Different profiles have varying needs that should be considered when implementing digital services. Overcoming the barriers to the adoption of telehealth is imperative for successfully executing these initiatives, especially in LMICs.

Despite extensive research on the impact of individual and environmental factors on negative risk-taking behaviors, the understanding of these factors’ influence on positive risk-taking, and how it compares to negative risk taking, remains limited. This research employed machine-learning techniques to identify shared and unique predictors across individual, family, and peer domains. Participants (N= 1012; 44% girls;Mage = 14.60 years, SD = 1.16 years) were drawn from three public middle schools in a large city in southern China (with 49.2% in grade 7 and 50.8% in grade 11). The findings indicate that positive risk-taking is significantly associated with general risk propensity, self-control, and negative parenting by father, while negative risk-taking is correlated with self-control, deviant peer affiliations, and peer victimization. Paternal negative parenting triggered positive risk-taking in boys, whereas self-control had a greater impact on girls. For negative risk-taking, boys were more affected by peer victimization, while girls were more influenced by deviant peer affiliations. This study further demonstrates that as progress from junior to senior high school, peer influence grows more significant in predicting positive risk taking; deviant peer affiliations exert a persistent pivotal influence, future positive time perspective replaces life satisfaction, and paternal negative parenting becomes increasingly impactful in predicting negative risk taking.

Children with special educational needs (SEN) experience developmental trajectories that require close attention, especially as they are highly vulnerable to sexual violence. Ensuring their well-being requires systemic attention to their needs. However, literature on children with SEN has critical limitations including insufficient focus on their sexual health education (SHE), inattention to parents’ perspectives, and a dearth of multilevel approaches to understanding SHE, particularly in conservative contexts like Malaysia. Using Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory, this study explored parents’ perspectives on SHE for their children with SEN across different layers of the socio-ecological environment. We interviewed 14 Malaysian parents of school-going children with SEN aged 4 to 24 years and conducted thematic analysis. At the individual level (child characteristics), we found that children with SEN receive unstructured and inconsistent SHE and are perceived as unready for SHE. At the microsystem level (family and school), parents displayed a belief-action gap towards SHE, and feared for their children’s sexual safety. The mesosystem (interactions between microsystems) highlighted the lack of teacher-parent collaboration in SHE delivery. Within the exosystem (external policies), parents noted a deficiency in stringent policies, leading parents to rely on unverified resources for SHE delivery. Finally, at the macrosystem level (cultural and societal influences), Malaysia’s diverse religious and cultural beliefs shape SHE implementation. This study emphasizes the importance of socio-cultural factors in SHE for children with SEN and stresses prioritizing their needs in policymaking and practice. It also calls for developing parent-centered programs and culturally tailored resources to improve parental awareness and knowledge.

The present study introduces the Persian Sentence Reading (PSR) Corpus, aiming to expand empirical data for Persian, an under-investigated language in research on oculomotor control in reading. Reading research has largely focused on Latin script languages with a left-to-right reading direction. However, languages with different reading directions, such as right-to-left and top-to-bottom, and particularly Persian script-based languages like Farsi and Dari, have remained understudied. This study pioneers in providing an eye movement dataset for reading Persian sentences, enabling further exploration of the influences of unique Persian characteristics on eye movement patterns during sentence reading. The core objective of the study is to provide data about how word characteristics impact eye movement patterns. The research also investigates the characteristics of the interplay between neighboring words and eye movements on them. By broadening the scope of reading research beyond commonly studied languages, the study aims to contribute to an interdisciplinary approach to reading research, exemplifying investigations through various theoretical and methodological perspectives.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with altered brain activity. However, little is known about the integrated temporospatial variation of dynamic spontaneous brain activity in ASD. In the present study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed for 105 ASD and 102 demographically-matched typically developmental controls (TC) children obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange database. Using the sliding-window approach, temporal, spatial, and temporospatial variability of dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (tvALFF, svALFF, and tsvALFF) were calculated for each participant. Group-comparisons were further performed at global, network, and brain region levels to quantify differences between ASD and TC groups. The relationship between temporospatial dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation variation alterations and clinical symptoms of ASD was finally explored by a support vector regression model. Relative to TC, we found enhanced tvALFF in visual network (Vis), somatomotor network (SMT), and salience/ventral attention network (SVA) of ASD, and weakened tvALFF in dorsal attention network (DAN) of ASD. Besides, ASD showed decreased svALFF in Vis, SVA, and limbic network (Limbic), and increased svALFF in DAN and default mode network (DMN). Elevated tsvALFF was found in the Vis, SMT, and DMN of ASD. More importantly, the altered tsvALFF from the DMN can predict the symptom severity of ASD. These findings demonstrate altered temporospatial dynamics of the spontaneous brain activity in ASD and provide novel insights into the neural mechanism underlying ASD.

To examine the relationship between empathy and mental health in healthcare workers, the mediating role of social support, and the moderating role of academic qualifications. A sample of 513 healthcare workers completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Social Support Scale, and General Health Questionnaire. (1) Significant correlations were observed among empathy (cognitive empathy), social support (including intra-family support, friend support, and significant other support), and mental health (P< 0.01). (2) Social support was found to be a significant mediator in the relationship linking empathy to the mental health of healthcare workers (P< 0.001). (3) Educational qualifications were identified as a moderating factor in the relationship linking social support to mental health (P<0.01). Specifically, social support exhibited a stronger association with mental health among healthcare workers with lower educational levels (β= -0.516,t= -9.414,P< 0.001). Healthcare workers’ psychological well-being can be enhanced by nurturing their empathy and establishing a robust social support system.

This paper explores the evolving relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and human creativity through two distinct yet interconnected perspectives: contemporary insights on AI's cognitive capabilities and philosophical foundations of creativity. In the first part, it examines the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in replicating human thought and creativity, emphasizing the importance of embodied cognition, emotional depth, and ethical considerations surrounding AI-generated content. Key findings from neuroscience and studies on algorithm aversion highlight the necessity of maintaining human authenticity in creative practices. The second part draws on influential thinkers such as Rollo May, Judith Butler, Kimberlé Crenshaw, and bell hooks to underscore the deeply personal and relational dimensions of creativity that AI cannot replicate. It discusses concepts such as courage, performativity, intersectionality, and emotional intelligence, illuminating the complexities of human identity and expression. The paper concludes with recommendations aimed at fostering collaboration between AI and human creators, developing ethical guidelines, and enhancing critical literacy regarding AI technologies. By synthesizing these perspectives, the paper underscores the need to recognize and preserve the unique qualities of human creativity in an increasingly AI-influenced landscape, inviting thoughtful engagement with the intersection of human expression and technological innovation.

A positive caregiver-teacher relationship has the potential to promote student progress. Yet, little is understood about factors contributing to effective caregiver-teacher alliance and team building on behalf of students with autism. Data from randomized controlled trials of a home-school collaborative planning and teacher coaching intervention called COMPASS were used to determine whether caregivers’ perceptions of teacher alliance was associated with child goal attainment outcomes, and what caregiver and child factors were associated with alliance of the 75 caregivers, those who received COMPASS were more likely to report higher alliance compared to caregivers who did not receive COMPASS. Further, higher ratings of objective assessment of child goal attainment of social, communication, and learning skills were associated with higher alliance. For child variables, higher caregiver and teacher ratings of externalizing behavior were associated with lower ratings of alliance. Lastly, higher ratings of caregiving stress were associated with lower alliance. Autism severity, age, adaptive behavior, IQ and family income were not associated with alliance; however, caregiver stress was significantly associated. These findings demonstrate the association between alliance and child progress and how COMPASS improves alliance. Also, attention to caregivers of children with externalizing behaviors may be particularly warranted given the impact on caregiver-teacher alliance.

This paper introduces a new database of eye-tracking data on English derived words, DerLex. A total of 598 unique derived suffixed words were embedded in sentences and read by 357 participants representing both university convenience pools and community pools of non-college-bound adults. Besides the eye-movement record of reading derived suffixed words, the DerLex database provides the author recognition test (ART) scores for each participant, tapping into their reading proficiency, as well as multiple lexical variables reflecting distributional, orthographic, phonological, and semantic features of the words, their constituent morphemes, and morphological families. The paper additionally reports the main effects of select lexical variables and their interactions with the ART scores. It also produces estimates of statistical power and sample sizes required to reliably detect those lexical effects. While some effects are robust and can be readily detected even in a small-scale typical experiment, the over-powered DerLex database does not offer sufficient power to detect many other effects—including those of theoretical importance for existing accounts of morphological processing. We believe that both the availability of the new data resource and the limitations it provides for the planning and design of upcoming experiments are useful for future research on morphological complexity.

Past research suggests that pitch height can influence the perceived tempo of speech and music, such that higher-pitched signals seem faster than lower-pitched ones. However, previous studies have analyzed perceived tempo across a relatively limited range of fundamental frequencies. To investigate whether this higher-equals-faster illusion generalizes across the wider range of human hearing, we conducted a series of five experiments. We asked participants to compare the tempo of repeating tones from six different octaves and with 15 different interonset intervals to a metronomic standard tempo. In Experiments1–3, we observed an inverted U-shaped effect of pitch on perceived tempo, with the perceived tempo of piano tones peaking between A4 (440 Hz) and A5 (880 Hz) and decreasing at lower and higher frequencies. This bias was consistent across base tempos and was only slightly attenuated by synchronous tapping with the repeating tones. Experiment4tested synthetic complex tones to verify that this nonlinearity generalizes beyond the piano timbre and that it was not related to the presence of low-frequency mechanical noise present in our piano tones. Experiment5revealed that the decrease in perceived tempo at extremely high octaves can be abolished by exposing participants to only high-pitched tones. Together, our results suggest that perceived tempo depends more on the relative pitch within a context than on absolute pitch and that tempo biases may invert or taper off beyond a two-octave range. We relate this context-dependence to human vocal ranges and propose that illusory tempo effects are strongest within pitch ranges consistent with human vocalization.

Gender inequality is prevalent in patriarchal societies, influencing the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Despite their significant contributions, research focusing on women-related topics in behavior analysis has only recently garnered consistent attention in Brazil. This oversight suggests a historical silencing and invisibility of women and their interests in this domain. The current research conducted a bibliometric analysis of authorship distribution between men and women in scientific publications within Brazilian Behavior Analysis journals from 2010 to 2022. The findings reveal a consistent female presence in scholarly output, with the percentage of publications featuring female authors ranging from 63.7% to 88.8%, consistently remaining above 70% in the past five years analyzed. However, gender inequality was observed concerning women as leading authors, ranging from 38.46% to 75.3%. The study recommends potential research methodologies and approaches to identify gender inequalities in science. It also provides actionable suggestions for interventions to address the underrepresentation of women in Behavior Analysis.

Hope is a cognitive trait defined as the perceived capacity to identify strategies (pathways) and maintain motivation (agency) in the pursuit of goals. Hope is most commonly measured using the Adult Hope Scale (AHS). Past work has provided support for the factor structure and reliability of the AHS, but there is limited evidence of measurement invariance of the AHS. The present study examined measurement invariance across race/ethnicity and gender in a large and diverse (n= 3495; 76.9% Women, 32.9% Hispanic, 32.3% Asian/Pacific Islander, 22.1% White, and 12.7% Black/African American) sample of young adults in the United States. Results supported scalar measurement invariance across all race/ethnicity and gender groups and minimal differences in associations between the agency and pathways components of hope or mean levels of hope across groups with the exception of Asian adults reporting lower levels of hope than other groups. These results provide clear empirical support for the consistency of the factor structure and assessment of hope across race/ethnicity and gender and provide an important foundation for examining the potential benefits of hope across diverse populations.

Most current databases for bodily emotion expression are created in Western countries, resulting in culturally skewed representations. To address the obvious risk this bias poses to academic comprehension, we attempted to expand the current repertoire of human bodily emotions by recruiting Asian professional performers to wear whole-body suits with 57 retroreflective markers attached to major joints and body segments, and express seven basic emotions with whole-body movements in a motion-capture lab. For each emotion, actors performed three self-created scenarios that covered a broad range of real-life events to elicit the target emotion within 2–5 seconds. Subsequently, a separate group of participants was invited to judge the perceived emotional category from the extracted biological motions (point-light displays with 18 or 57 markers). The results demonstrated that the emotion discrimination accuracy was comparable to Western databases containing standardized performance scenarios. The results provide a significant step toward establishing a database using a novel emotional induction approach based on personalized scenarios. This database will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of emotional expression across diverse contexts.

The author discusses the idea that psychoanalysts could benefit from a common paradigm, not necessarily a single theory, but a general frame through which to view their work. Focusing on perception as a basic modality of psychic life, in combination with the system-environment approach, could provide this common baseline. The text explores how this approach relates to the work of Freud, Bion, and Winnicott, emphasizing the interconnectedness of systems and their environments, the role of perception, and the concept of a contact barrier. The notion of tangential interlocking is proposed as a way of illustrating how the system Freud called perception-consciousness is the contact-barrier common to all the psycho-somatic functions of interest to psychoanalysis.

The university years are when individuals evaluate their qualifications, make choices about their careers, and develop the adaptation process and skills they may need for the careers that they may choose. In this context, individuals’ competencies and abilities in various fields play an essential role. Four hundred nine university students (304 female, 105 male) participated in this study. This research explains the theoretical model that the variables of general self-efficacy, and career adaptability affect the hope through structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings of general self-efficacy and career adaptability explain hope by 85%. In addition, career adaptability has a mediating role in the relationship between general self-efficacy and hope. These results are thought to be essential for the guidance services to be implemented at the university level.

The objectives of the current study were to investigate the potential mediating role of alcohol consumption motives in the relationships between psychological distress and problematic alcohol consumption, and emotional dysregulation and problematic alcohol consumption. This study included 292 participants from Romania, with 82.5% female, ranging in age from 19 to 62 years (M = 28.71; SD = 9.34). The participants completed instruments assessing psychological distress, emotional dysregulation, drinking motives, problematic alcohol consumption, and socio-demographic data. Our findings indicate that psychological distress and emotional dysregulation predict problematic alcohol consumption. Additionally, social, conformity, and coping motives mediated the relationships between psychological distress and problematic alcohol consumption, as well as between emotional dysregulation and problematic alcohol consumption. Meanwhile, the enhancement motive did not mediate the aforementioned relationships. This may be attributed to its association with seeking positive experiences rather than managing negative emotions, making it less relevant for individuals experiencing psychological distress in the Romanian cultural context, where alcohol is often used for social engagement or conformity rather than enhancement. Our study contributes to advancing the knowledge from the literature regarding how people engage in problematic alcohol consumption, while highlighting the importance of consumption motives. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

We tested whether targets receiving high (vs. low) social support would be expected to experience less emotional and physical pain because higher social support is expected to work as a buffer against pain. Participants (n= 330) were assigned to one of six conditions (social support: high vs. low vs. control × target gender: male vs. female). Participants estimated the emotional (but not physical) pain of targets receiving high social support to be lower than that of those receiving low social support. A test of a serial mediation model (i.e., social support → target impression → expected buffering effect → pain estimation) revealed that participants rated high social support targets’ impression more positively, which predicted expectation of a larger emotional/physical buffering effect, which in turn was associated with estimation of lower emotional/physical pain.

Numerous studies have highlighted the links between involvement in extracurricular activities and positive outcomes for youth. Nevertheless, studies documenting those links have been conducted primarily in the global North. Little is known about the effect of participating in extracurricular activities for youth developing in extreme contexts (i.e. extreme poverty, refugee camps, conflicted areas, areas affected by climate changes, sexual exploitation or child soldiers). This research is testing if the participation in extracurricular activities of youth (N = 96; Mage= 15.07) developing in an extreme context had an effect over time on their psychological well-being as well as the satisfaction and frustration of their basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence and relatedness). Youth were recruited through a partnership with a local NGO in southern Madagascar, which offers art and sports activities. A control group was recruited in a neighboring public school. Participants had never participated in NGO’s extracurricular activities before entering the study. Four data collection sessions were carried out over a span of 16 months. 96 participants engaged throughout the four data collection sessions. Mixed factorial Analyses of Variance were employed to test the objective. Results show that participation in extracurricular activities for youth developing in an extreme context had positive effects on the satisfaction of the need for autonomy (p = .037) and on the frustration of the basic psychological needs overall (p = .019). Also, the study results show that there was a protective effect of participating in extracurricular activities against the decrease of the needs’ satisfaction as this reduction was observed in the control group (p = .038) and not in the youth involved in extracurricular activities. Participation in art, music and sport extracurricular activities seems to have positive outcomes for youth living in an extreme context of development.

Motivational drivers and emotions that students experience play an important role in the process of learning a new language (L2). This has been recognised by researchers and educators, and extensive research has been conducted in recent decades to examine the psychological and emotional factors involved in L2 learning. However, two ubiquitous epistemic emotions, namely, boredom and curiosity, remain underexplored in the L2 research literature. This study addresses this gap. It performed a series of statistical tests to examine the relationship between these two epistemic emotions and L2 motivation. Specifically, it assessed whether epistemic curiosity plays a mediating role in the nexus of L2 motivation, epistemic curiosity, and epistemic boredom. Data were collected from adolescent learners of English in China (N= 312). The findings from the correlation analysis indicated that epistemic boredom had statistically significant negative relationships with epistemic curiosity and L2 motivation, except for the ought-to L2 self variable, where the relationship was not statistically significant. Conversely, epistemic curiosity had a positive and statistically significant relationship with L2 motivation, except for the ought-to L2 self variable, where the relationship was not statistically significant. Next, the path analysis examined the influence of L2 motivation on epistemic boredom without considering the mediating effect of epistemic curiosity. Its findings indicated that epistemic boredom had a statistically significant negative relationship with the general motivation/attitude and general motivation/effort variables. The subsequent path analysis, which focused solely on two goal-oriented L2 motivation constructs from the Gardnerian framework, detected the mediating role of epistemic curiosity. Some pedagogical implications are drawn from these findings.

Bystander intervention programs have the potential to address domestic violence in college settings by providing students with specific ways to support friends and peers experiencing abuse. However, the majority of bystander intervention programs require in-person facilitators and hours of commitment. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a self-paced online program focusing on bystander intervention for domestic violence. TheStop the Silence Projectis a self-paced online program that can be utilized at no cost and in the absence of trained facilitators or scheduled training sessions. An experimental group of college students (n= 168) engaged with the program and completed theBystander Intervention for Domestic Violence Questionnaire. A control group (n= 30) completed the questionnaire without engaging with the program. First, an exploratory factor analysis was performed to validate theBystander Intervention for Domestic Violence Questionnaire. Results indicated that the questionnaire measures students’ willingness to offer support to peers, intentions to address domestic violence as a societal issue, and sense of responsibility to help one’s peers. Next, the two groups were compared on their responses to the questionnaire. College students who engaged with the program reported higher intentions to address domestic violence as a societal issue. This promising program offers one way to counter domestic violence when faced with limited resources in college and university settings.

A growing body of literature supports the use of echoic prompts toward conditioning other functional language skills. However, many individuals with autism spectrum disorder do not emit echoic behavior. Identifying the prerequisite skills of an echoic repertoire may be beneficial for intervention planning and clinical decision making. A chart review was conducted for 118 patients with autism who received early intensive behavioral intervention. We examined the Level 1 scores on theVerbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program(Sundberg,2014) for all patients. Using their scores on the echoic skills subtest as a dependent variable, we ran a binomial logistic regression in which the remaining eight domains, along with age and sex, served as independent variables. Our logistic regression model was statistically significant:X2(10) = 109.61,p< .001. The model explained 86.0% of the variance in echoic verbal behavior and correctly classified 95.8% of cases. Patients who demonstrated a mand repertoire were greater than 3.5 times more likely to also exhibit an echoic repertoire. Additionally, vocal play and motor imitation were associated with an increased ability to echo. Using binomial logistic regression, we identified three predictors influencing the echoic behavior of children with autism. Patients who demonstrated these three skills were statistically significantly more likely to echo the vocal verbal behavior of others. Additional research is now needed to confirm a functional relationship between each of these predictors and echoic control.

Mathematical and spatial abilities are positively related at both the behavioral and neural levels. Much of the evidence illuminating this relationship comes from classic laboratory-based experimental methods focused on cognitive performance despite most individuals also experiencing math and space in other contexts, such as in conversations or lectures. To broaden our understanding of math-space integration in these more commonplace situations, we used an auditory memory-encoding task with stimuli whose content evoked a range of educational and everyday settings related to math or spatial thinking. We used a multivariate approach to directly assess the extent of neural similarity between activity patterns elicited by these math and spatial stimuli. Results from whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed a highly specific positive relation between math and spatial activity patterns in bilateral anterior hippocampi. Examining individual variation in math-space similarity, we found that greater math-space similarity in bilateral anterior hippocampi was associated withpoorermath skills andhigheranxiety about math. Integration of neural responses to mathematical and spatial content may not always portend positive outcomes. We suggest that episodic simulation of quotidian contexts may link everyday experiences with math and spatial thinking—and the strength of this link is predictive of math in a manner that diverges from math-space associations derived from more lab-based tasks. On a methodological level, this work points to the value of considering a wider range of experimental paradigms, and of the value of combining multivariate fMRI analysis with behavioral data to better contextualize interpretations of brain data.

Students with high incidence disabilities in the public school system often perform multiple grade levels below their typically developing peers in mathematics achievement. These students exhibit lower levels of on-task behavior that limits their access to effective instruction, thus requiring instructional interventions that personalize learning, differentiate materials, and ultimately promote academic engagement. In recent years, the use of technology-mediated and computer-assisted instruction has shown to have positive results with students with disabilities. Blended learning, an intervention that combines face-to-face instruction with computer-based instruction, has been shown to improve the on-task behavior and achievement of students with disabilities. In this study, blended learning was implemented with three middle school students with emotional behavior disorders in a therapeutic setting in a large city in the southeastern United States. Using a multiple baseline across participants single case design, this study examined the relationship between blended learning eighth grade mathematics instruction and student on-task behavior, teacher engagement, and mathematics achievement. After exposure to the intervention through 21 sessions over 5 weeks, both student and teacher engagement increased with the use of station-rotation blended learning. Math achievement, measured through the AIMSweb curriculum-based math probes, improved for two of three student participants. Social validity questionnaires revealed that students and teacher enjoyed the blended learning intervention; however, continued use depended on properly functioning technology. Future research in the area of blended learning math instruction should strive to accurately measure on- and off-task behavior under the computer-based condition.

The nature of visual processes underlying scene perception remains a hotly debated topic. According to one view, scene and object perception rely on similar neural mechanisms, and their processing pathways are tightly interlinked. According to another, scene gist might follow a separate pathway, relying primarily on global image properties. Recently, this latter idea has been supported with a set of experiments using content priming as a probe into scene and object perception (Brady et al.Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance,43, 1160–1176,2017). The experiments have shown that preserving only structureless global ensemble texture information in the images of scenes could support rapid scene perception; however, preserving the same information in the images of objects failed to support object perception. We were intrigued by these results, since they are at odds with findings showing that scene content is primarily carried by the explicit encoding of scene structure as represented, for instance, by contours and their properties. In an attempt to reconcile these results, we attempted to replicate the experiments. In our replication experiment, we failed to find any evidence for a privileged use of texture information for scene as opposed to object primes. We conclude that there is no sufficient evidence for any fundamental differences in the processing pathways for object and scene perception: both rely on structural features that describe spatial relationships between constituent parts as well as texture information. To address this issue in the most rigorous manner possible, we here present the results of both a pilot experiment and a pre-registered replication attempt.

Quigley and colleagues (2024, Behavior Analysis in Practice,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40617-024-01001-4) described a treatment recommendation scenario within a multi-disciplinary team setting for an adult with a developmental disability. The authors presented the information in a standard format to share how the involved parties identified, evaluated, and responded to the recommendation based upon their understanding of ethical decision-making. In this response, the right to effective treatment is emphasized as a primary obligation of the treatment team. The review of the procedure reveals that the intended intervention is one that is both unproven to be effective and similar to an intervention known to be harmful. Multiple available resources support the need to avoid the use of this intervention. Implications and suggestions for decision-making in clinical contexts are highlighted.

The main goal of the present research was to explore the links between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism and fertility (number of children) due to its conceptual significance in estimating the adaptiveness of narcissism in an evolutionary sense. Furthermore, we aimed to explain these links via mating behavior (attachment in romantic relationships, short and long-term mating, and relationship satisfaction) and reproductive motivation (positive and negative childbearing motivations, and age of first reproduction) in participants from Serbia (N= 953). Correlation analysis showed similar associations between the two narcissism dimensions, mating and reproduction: negative associations are found between narcissism components and fertility, and long-term mating, followed by positive correlations with insecure attachment and negative childbearing motivations (although grandiose narcissism had positive associations with positive childbearing motives as well). Therefore, correlation analysis together with the structural model where narcissism is analyzed as a single trait showed that narcissism as a whole is associated with lower fitness. However, a structural model where two subdimensions are modeled separately revealed substantial differences between the two forms of narcissism in regard to mating and reproduction. The link between vulnerable narcissism and fertility was completely mediated by lower reproductive motivation (both types of motives), shorter duration of romantic relationships, and diminished relationship satisfaction. On the other hand, grandiose narcissism was positively associated with positive childbearing motives and relationship satisfaction; hence, it was positively indirectly associated with fertility via these links. The present findings may shed some light on differences between the narcissistic traits in their links with fertility—while both narcissistic dimensions seem to be largely maladaptive in an evolutionary sense, the distinctive features of grandiose narcissism may have some benefits for fertility.

The development of multimedia technology has given new life to the painting collection, forming a sharp contrast between the static collection and the dynamic exhibits. Studying the cognitive experience differences between static and dynamic exhibitions can better guide museum exhibit design and improve the quality of experience. In this paper, a combination of eye-tracking experiments and questionnaires will be used. A total of 40 volunteers were recruited to measure the presentation form and experience time in the museum exhibition, and to analyse the cognitive situation and perceptual experience of the visitors. It was found that (1) on the comparison of the presentation forms, it was found that at 5000 ms and 15,000 ms, the cognitive effect and stimulation experience of dynamic exhibitions are excellent, and the overall effectiveness is better. The emotional experience of dynamic exhibitions is significantly affected by the presentation time, and the experience of static exhibitions is significantly better at 25,000 ms and 35,000 ms. (2) On the comparison of experience time, it was found that the best feedback experience of subjects’ perceived information was observed in dynamic exhibitions at a presentation time of 15,000 ms, while the best feedback experience of subjects was observed in static exhibitions at a presentation time of 25,000 ms. The study can provide a certain scientific basis for this type of exhibition design.

Although there have been many studies on how regular physical exercise and reducing dependence on mobile phones can improve cervical dysfunction, there is currently a lack of model research to verify the interaction between the three. In addition, as a high-risk group for cervical spine dysfunction, college students' education level may have a moderating effect on this model, which will provide more targeted and effective suggestions for developing intervention strategies to improve cervical spine dysfunction in college students. From January 2023 to May 2023, an electronic questionnaire survey was conducted on 861 college students in the southwest region, with education levels including vocational, undergraduate, and graduate students, The survey content includes demographic information, the Physical Activity Rating Scale (PARS-3), the Mobile Phone Addiction Index (MAPI), and the Neck Disability Index (NDI). The PARS-3 of college students was negatively correlated with NDI (r = -0.142, p < 0.01), PARS-3 was negatively correlated with MAPI (r = -0.09, p < 0.01), MAPI was positively correlated with NDI (r = 0.353, p < 0.01), indicating that mobile phone dependency mediated the relationship between physical exercise and cervical spine dysfunction (P < 0.01); educational level could moderate the effect of physical exercise on cervical spine dysfunction (β = -0.06, p < 0.05). The physical exercise of college students in the southwestern region of China is negatively correlated with cervical spine dysfunction and mobile phone dependency; mobile phone dependency is positively correlated with cervical spine dysfunction; mobile phone dependency plays a mediating role between physical exercise and cervical spine dysfunction; the educational level of college students can to a certain extent moderate the impact of physical exercise on cervical spine dysfunction. Those with higher baseline education levels have a greater degree of improvement in NDI through physical exercise; On the contrary, people with lower levels of education have relatively less improvement in NDI through physical exercise.

Flexible Working Time (FWT) has traditionally been viewed as a workplace policy fostering family-friendly environments and enhancing employee productivity. However, the current comprehension of the impact of FWT on employees appears incomplete and fails to acknowledge the complex effects of FWT. According to the conservation of resources theory, this study examines the double-edged sword effects of FWT, and the moderating role of marital status, providing a more nuanced understanding of how FWT differently influences OCB towards organizations (OCBO) and individuals (OCBI). We tested our model using a three-wave time-lagged study with 267 employees in China. Results indicated that individual and relational energy play significant and opposing mediating roles in the relationship between FWT and OCBO/OCBI. Moreover, we found significant differences in these two paths for married and unmarried. This research contributes to scholarly discussions on FWT and offers novel insights for practitioners to implement FWT appropriately in their organizations.

The purpose of this design case is to narrate an iterative design story to develop a series of technology preparation curricula for teacher preparation contextualized in a Hispanic Serving Institution in the Southwest United States. In this initiative, we addressed the incorporation of two critical design elements including computational funds of identity and computational thinking as a problem-solving method in support of inclusive technology-integrated practice and social justice in K-12 learning environments. We reviewed our design phases to address how we framed our design procedure, performed problem analysis, and formulated our design solutions. We prototyped our curriculum to gain insights on teacher candidates’ perceptions of the two incorporated design elements drawing on nuanced learning dynamics. This also enabled us to further refine the balance between our design inquiry and the teacher candidates’ diverse needs. We believe this narrative opens a story of how to advance teacher candidates’ technology competencies and computational thinking in a manner that embraces cultural relevance in response to the rapid development of emerging learning technologies. This in turn contributes to the current instructional design discourse by addressing the interdisciplinary nature of computer science education, educational technology, and social justice for teacher education.

Process-based behavior therapy (PBBT®) is a recently developed therapeutic approach based almost entirely on the core behavioral process of arbitrarily applicable relational responding (AARR), as postulated by relational frame theory (RFT), and in particular on advances in the theory made in recent years. In particular, PBBT directs its attention towards the hyper-dimensional multi-level (HDML) framework for conceptualizing relational responding and the basic behavioral unit that emerged from that framework, called the ROE unit (i.e., the ongoing dynamic interaction of Relating, Orienting, and Evoking), for conceptualizing human psychological events. The current article seeks to outline and provide an introduction to PBBT as a contemporary behavioral therapeutic approach to psychological suffering and mental well-being. Toward this aim, the ROE unit and related RFT concepts will first be summarized followed by presentation of three key components of PBBT. Clinical examples are provided throughout to help illustrate the tight links between updated RFT and its clinical application in PBBT.

Determining an appropriate sample size in psychological experiments is a common challenge, requiring a balance between maximizing the chance of detecting a true effect (minimizing false negatives) and minimizing the risk of observing an effect where none exists (minimizing false positives). A recent study proposes using effect size stabilization, a form of optional stopping, to define sample size without increasing the risk of false positives. In effect size stabilization, researchers monitor the effect size of their samples throughout the sampling process and stop sampling when the effect no longer varies beyond predefined thresholds. This study aims to improve our understanding of effect size stabilization properties. Simulations involving effect size stabilization are presented, with parametric modulation of the true effect in the population and the strictness of the stabilization rule. As previously demonstrated, the results indicate that optional stopping based on effect-size stabilization consistently yields unbiased samples over the long run. However, simulations also reveal that effect size stabilization does not guarantee the detection of a true effect in the population. Consequently, researchers adopting effect size stabilization put themselves at risk of increasing type 2 error probability. Instead of using effect-size stabilization procedures for testing, researchers should use them to reach accurate parameter estimates.

Imageability, an important word characteristic in the psycholinguistic literature, is typically assessed by asking participants to estimate the ease with which a word can evoke a mental image. Our aim was to explore inter-rater disagreement in normative imageability ratings. We examined the predictors of variability around average imageability ratings for young, middle-aged and older adults (Study1) and assessed its impact on visual word recognition performance in young adults (Study2). Analyses of French age-related imageability ratings (Ballot et al.,Behavior Research Methods,54, 196–215,2022) revealed that inter-rater disagreement around the average imageability value was critically high for most words within the imageability norms, thus questioning the construct validity of the average rating for the most variable items. Variability in ratings changed between age groups (18-25, 26-40, 41-59, and over 60 years) and was associated with words that are longer, less frequent, learnt later in life and less emotional (Study1). To examine the consequences of elevated standard deviations around the average imageability rating on visual word recognition, we entered this factor in a hierarchical regression alongside classic lexico-semantic predictors. The effect of word-imageability on young adults’ lexical decision times (Ferrand et al.,Behavior Research Methods,50, 1285–1307,2018) remained significant after accounting for inter-rater disagreement in imageability ratings, even when considering the least consensual words (Study2). We conclude that imageability ratings reliably predict visual word recognition performance in young adults for large datasets, but might require caution for smaller ones. Given imageability rating differences across adulthood, further research investigating age-related differences in language processing is necessary.

Statistical learning is a mechanism for detecting associations among co-occurring elements in many domains and species. A key controversy is whether it leads to memory for discrete chunks composed of these associated elements, or merely to pairwise associations among elements. Critical evidence for the mere-association view comes from the “phantom-word” phenomenon, where learners recognize statistically coherent but unattested items better than actually presented items with weaker internal associations, suggesting that they prioritize pairwise associations over memories for discrete units. However, this phenomenon has only been demonstrated for sequentially presented stimuli, but not for simultaneously presented visual shapes, where learners might prioritize discrete units over pairwise associations. Here, I ask whether the phantom-word phenomenon can be observed with simultaneously presented visual shapes. Learners were familiarized with scenes combining two triplets of visual shapes (hereafter “words”). They were then tested on their recognition of these words vs. part-words (attested items with weaker internal associations), of phantom-words (unattested items with strong internal associations) vs. part-words, and of words vs. phantom-words. Learners preferred both words and phantom-words over part-words and showed no preference for words over phantom-words. This suggests that, as for sequentially input, statistical learning in simultaneously presented shapes leads primarily to pairwise associations rather than to memories for discrete chunks. However, as, in some analyses, the preference for words over part-words was slightly higher than for phantom-words over part-words, the results do not rule out that, for simultaneous presented items, learners might have some limited sensitivity to frequency of occurrence.

Social anxiety (SA) and depressive disorder usually coexist. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a protective factor against emotional disorders. The aim of this study is to examine the moderating role of EI in the relationship between SA and depression among Spanish and Portuguese adolescents. Information on these variables was collected through a cross-sectional study with 1456 students between 12 and 19 years of age. The software PROCESS was used to perform the analysis of conditional processes (model 1). The moderation model was conducted, including the covariate country, and showed significant differences between countries in the relationship between SA and Depression. The summary model explained that 42% of the Depression. The statistical analysis was repeated separately for Portuguese and Spanish adolescents, with EI as the moderating variable. The effect of SA on depression was significant for individuals with low or moderate EI, while for adolescents with high EI there was no statistically significant effect. To prevent these outcomes, early interventions, including the enhancement of Trait EI, with adolescents with SA could reduce the risk of developing SA disorder, as well as subsequent depressive disorders in adolescence and early adulthood. This is especially important because research indicates that depression caused by SA is strongly associated with a worse course of depression.

The main goal of the present research was to explore the links between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism and fertility (number of children) due to its conceptual significance in estimating the adaptiveness of narcissism in an evolutionary sense. Furthermore, we aimed to explain these links via mating behavior (attachment in romantic relationships, short and long-term mating, and relationship satisfaction) and reproductive motivation (positive and negative childbearing motivations, and age of first reproduction) in participants from Serbia (N= 953). Correlation analysis showed similar associations between the two narcissism dimensions, mating and reproduction: negative associations are found between narcissism components and fertility, and long-term mating, followed by positive correlations with insecure attachment and negative childbearing motivations (although grandiose narcissism had positive associations with positive childbearing motives as well). Therefore, correlation analysis together with the structural model where narcissism is analyzed as a single trait showed that narcissism as a whole is associated with lower fitness. However, a structural model where two subdimensions are modeled separately revealed substantial differences between the two forms of narcissism in regard to mating and reproduction. The link between vulnerable narcissism and fertility was completely mediated by lower reproductive motivation (both types of motives), shorter duration of romantic relationships, and diminished relationship satisfaction. On the other hand, grandiose narcissism was positively associated with positive childbearing motives and relationship satisfaction; hence, it was positively indirectly associated with fertility via these links. The present findings may shed some light on differences between the narcissistic traits in their links with fertility—while both narcissistic dimensions seem to be largely maladaptive in an evolutionary sense, the distinctive features of grandiose narcissism may have some benefits for fertility.

ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the role of state policies in the contexts of accessing parenthood for sexual minority individuals and same-sex couples.BackgroundThese are LGBTQ people who want to have children face significant barriers for achieving parenthood, notably depending on the policies regulating access to assisted reproductive technologies, foster care, and adoption.MethodsWe use a national probability sample of 1507 sexual minority adults living across US states and belonging to three age cohorts.ResultsAlthough the proportion of LGBQ parents did not vary across the country, the pathways to parenthood did. In states with more inclusive policies, LGBQ parents accessed parenthood through formal (ART/adoption) or alternative pathways (co-parenting or step-parenting), whereas different-sex pathways were dominant in states with less inclusive policies.ConclusionState policy context is not associated with whether sexual minority adults are parents, but rather how they become parents.Policy ImplicationsAdditional policies could be implemented in order to protect sexual minority prospective parents from experiencing discrimination when they try to access adoption, foster care, or ART. Additionally, professionals and families could receive training about gender and sexual minority families.

BackgroundNotwithstanding the documented short- and long-term weight loss and remission of physical and mental diseases following bariatric surgery, a significant proportion of patients fail to respond (fully) to treatment in terms of physical and mental health improvement. Mounting evidence links food-specific impulsivity, prefrontal cortex (PFC) hypoactivity and disrupted hormone secretion in bariatric surgery candidates to poorer post-surgical health outcomes. Neuromodulatory treatments like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) uniquely target these neurobehavioral impairments. We present a pilot study protocol offering tDCS combined with an inhibitory control training and a structured psychosocial intervention to patients after bariatric surgery.MethodsA total ofN= 20 patients are randomized to 6 sessions of verum or sham tDCS over the PFC, combined with an individualized food-specific inhibitory control training and a structured psychosocial intervention within 18 months after bariatric surgery (t0). Beyond acceptability, feasibility and satisfaction of the intervention, effects of verum versus sham tDCS on food-specific impulsivity and on secondary outcomes quality of life, general impulsivity and psychopathology, food-related cravings, eating disorder psychopathology, weight trajectory and endocrine markers are assessed 4 weeks (t1) and 3 months after the intervention (t2).DiscussionResults will provide information on the potential of combining tDCS with an inhibitory control training and a structured psychosocial intervention to enhance physical and mental outcomes after bariatric surgery. The present study may guide the development of future research with regard to tDCS as a brain-based intervention and of future post-surgical clinical programs, paving the way for randomized-controlled trials in larger samples.Trial registrationThe trial was prospectively registered on July 8, 2024, under the registration number DRKS00034620 in the German Clinical Trials Register (https://drks.de/search/de/trial/DRKS00034620).

Starting from Moreno’s reflections on and reservations toward what he calledpsychodrama a deux, this paper, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie (ZPS), presents three contemporary models of one-to-one psychodrama work: open scene dramatization, internal psychodrama and relationship psychotherapy. I will present the underlying theoretical concepts to these models, their practical application, the techniques used, and the adaptations made in comparison to classical group psychodrama. I will then compare these three models from the perspective of the five instruments of psychodrama (stage, protagonist, director, auxiliary egos and audience), and finally also share some reflections on the online use of each model.

Empathy plays a crucial role in children’s social-emotional development. There is an increasing trend in recent studies to recognize empathy as a multi-dimensional construct, consisting of three distinct hierarchical levels: emotion contagion, attention to others’ feelings and prosocial behaviors (Hoffman,Motiv Emot, 14(2), 151–172, 1990). The present study is amongst the first to use a longitudinal approach to examine the development trajectories of the distinct empathic levels, based on a sample of Chinese preschoolers aged 2 to 6 years, half of the sample being deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH). Our results showed that according to the parental observation, DHH preschoolers manifested similar extent of emotion contagion and attention to others’ feelings as their TH (typically hearing) peers over preschool years. Yet, DHH preschoolers showed fewer prosocial behaviors, compared to their TH peers. As for the longitudinal associations over time, emotion contagion contributed to more internalizing and externalizing behaviors in both groups; whilst attention to others’ feelings contributed to fewer internalizing behaviors in only DHH children. Prosocial behaviors contributed to better social competence, and fewer internalizing and externalizing behaviors in both DHH and TH children just as expected. These outcomes imply that the early intervention or special education may be useful to safeguard children’s empathic development, shrinking the gaps between DHH and TH children; but meanwhile, cultural factors might cause latent effects on children’s understandings of empathy and impact on how empathy “regulates” children’s social-emotional functioning, in a Chinese cultural context.

ObjectivesAppreciative joy, one of the four immeasurables in Buddhism, has been widely incorporated into mindfulness literature. However, current measurements of appreciative joy have various limitations, including the inability to capture the concept of appreciative joy, strong correlations between dimensions, and a lack of sensitivity to short-term changes. This study aimed to address these limitations by developing a Short-Term Appreciative Joy Scale (SAJS) to measure appreciative joy over 2 weeks.MethodIn Study 1, exploratory factor analysis (n= 325) and confirmatory factor analysis (n= 210) were used to validate the factor structure of the SAJS. Study 2 (n= 273) used correlation analysis to test the criterion validity and incremental validity of the SAJS. Study 3 (n= 499) further used a randomized controlled trial to investigate the application of the SAJS in a loving-kindness and compassion meditation intervention.ResultsStudy 1 identified a 15-item SAJS with three factors: appreciation, joy, and non-envy. Study 2 revealed that scores on the non-envy dimension were negatively related to negative emotions, negative attitudes toward others, and envy, even after controlling for trait appreciative joy. Study 3 further revealed that scores on the appreciation and joy dimensions improved significantly after the intervention and mediated the changes in positive emotions and prosocial attitudes.ConclusionThe SAJS is a reliable and valid measure of appreciative joy, and its sensitivity to short-term change makes it useful for intervention.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.

Parents of children with autism often experience a wide range of emotions in their daily lives. However, previous research has primarily focused on average levels of emotional challenges, neglecting the significance of daily emotion dynamics that may underlie parental psychological functioning. This study adopted a dynamic network approach to examine the strength of temporal connections within and between various emotions—referred to as emotion network density—and further explore its impacts on parental psychological distress. Participants included 76 Chinese parents (M= 36.36 years,SD= 3.95 years; 58 mothers) of children with autism. Parents reported their psychological distress at baseline and then completed measures of daily emotions over a 14-day period. The densities of overall, positive, and negative emotion networks were estimated using the Multilevel Vector Auto-Regression model. The results indicated that higher densities of the overall and negative emotion networks were associated with increased stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in parents. Further analysis of network components showed that the in-strength of fear and guilt (i.e., their likelihood of being affected by other emotions) and the out-strength of anger and guilt (i.e., their capacity to influence other emotions) were positively related to parental psychological distress. However, neither the overall density of the positive emotion network nor its specific components showed a significant relationship with parental psychological distress. These findings highlight the importance of considering the daily dynamics of emotions, particularly negative emotions, from a network perspective to better understand the development of psychological distress in parents of children with autism.

The purpose of this study was to inspect the psychometric properties of a newly developed measure, the General Inventory of Behaviours, Symptoms, and Opinions (GIBSO), and its efficacy in capturing underreporting. Students (N= 169) were randomly allocated to five conditions, (1) honest control (n= 35), and four groups of concealers: (2) psychological symptoms (n= 36), (3) antisocial behaviour (n= 33), (4) somatic complaints (n= 29), and (5) sexual deviance (n= 36). All participants received instructions corresponding to their group allocation and then received symptom inventories of all tested domains, the Supernormality Scale (SS), and GIBSO. Overall, honest participants obtained significantly higher scores on all symptom inventories and exhibited significantly lower underreporting measured by SS and GIBSO than the concealing groups. Further, using GIBSO’s cut-off point of > 20, the classification accuracy was satisfactory, with both sensitivity and specificity at .80 (AUC= .86). Our findings suggest that the GIBSO is a promising measure of symptom and behaviour concealment. However, further investigation involving both general and forensic samples is essential to confirm its efficacy.

The social support paradox describes mixed findings on the effects of social support on well-being. An application of the person-environment fit perspective can address the paradox by reasoning that similar quantities of social support needs and social support supplies should result in optimal well-being outcomes. We integrate a person-environment fit perspective with self-determination theory in an examination of the relationship between workplace instrumental support and emotional exhaustion through a two-week experience sampling method study. Fifty-nine participants responded to questions about desired quantities of work-related help from their colleagues (coworkers and supervisors) and their perceived quantities of work-related help after work and before bed. Participants responded to questions about their emotional exhaustion levels before bed. We utilized polynomial regression and response surface analyses to examine within-person. Within-person results indicate astressor effect,such that daily unmet support needs are associated with daily higher emotional exhaustion.

Neuroscientists in decision science have advanced an affect-integration-motivation (AIM) framework, demonstrating that neural activity associated with positive affect or value integration can predict individual and aggregate choice. Given that individuals with higher interoceptive sensibility (IS) have tendency to engage their bodily sensations and thus exhibit a more coherent pattern between their neural, affective, and behavioral measures, we investigated how IS may interact with the affective/integrative components for predicting individual and aggregate choice. Thus, we 1) explored neural underpinnings of individual choice, affective ratings, aggregate outcomes, 2) examined how the above-mentioned measures predict individual and aggregate choices on mobile games, and 3) tested the moderation effect of IS by comparing the differences in how these measures perform in prediction models between subgroups of IS. Neuroimaging results showed that individual choice associated with NAcc activity, aggregate download rate tracked by regions in salience network, and revenue additionally tracked by regions in motor tendency and attention regulation. Affective ratings and AIns activity predicted individual download choice; mPFC activity forecasted aggregate download rate, and positive arousal forecasted aggregate revenue. As hypothesized, the high IS group displayed coherent correlations between affective ratings, individual choice, and neural measures. More importantly, at the aggregate level, mPFC activity (integrative component), forecasted aggregate download rate above and beyond ratings and individual choice in the high IS group, with this prediction significantly stronger compared with the low IS group. These findings extend the AIM framework by shedding light on the influence of interoceptive sensibility on the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying human decision-making.

Although not typically within their primary duties, training, or educational background, police frequently encounter individuals with mental disorders or severe mental crises. These encounters are often characterized by uncertainty among police officers in assessing individuals' behavior and potential danger, and they do not always proceed free of conflict. Consequently, people with mental illnesses are more frequently subjected to police coercive measures or even police violence. Given the limited research on the perspectives of individuals with mental illnesses in police interactions, this study aimed to explore the subjective perceptions of people with mental illness (PMI) regarding conflictual encounters with police and to analyze de-escalating and escalating police behavior from their perspective. Another aim was to receive recommendations from the participants on how police should behave in such situations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 PMI who had resisted police actions or attacked police officers during encounters. Findings revealed a lack of understanding among participants regarding police actions and a feeling of being overwhelmed by the use of force. A calm and empathetic initial approach, coupled with clear communication and explanation, was identified as critical for de-escalation. Results underscore the importance of perceived procedural justice in reducing resistance among PMI. Enhancing police training with a focus on mental health awareness, communication skills, and empathy could potentially improve interactions and outcomes between police and PMI.

BackgroundA large proportion of individuals experience functional impairment in everyday life due to climate worry. However, the current understanding of this functional impairment is limited by the use of suboptimal measures. Furthermore, it is not known whether functional impairment due to climate worry affects pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) or whether individuals who experience such impairment perceive a need for support. The aims of the current study were (1) to extend previous research using an established measure of functional impairment (the Work and Social Adjustment Scale, WSAS), (2) to explore the associations between climate worry, functional impairment, and PEBs, and (3) to describe the characteristics and the perceived need for support of individuals with functional impairment due to climate worry.MethodsA cross-sectional survey targeting adult individuals who experience climate worry. Participants were recruited nationally in Sweden between September and October 2022. The survey included measures of climate worry severity, climate worry frequency, functional impairment, PEBs, depressive symptoms, sleep problems, and questions related to perceived need for support.ResultsA total of 1221 adults (75% women, mean age 46.3 years) were included in the analyses. Multivariate structural equation modeling revealed that climate worry severity and frequency were significantly associated with PEBs (β = 0.34 and β = 0.45, respectively). Climate worry frequency was associated with functional impairment (β = 0.41). Functional impairment was only marginally associated with PEBs (β = 0.05). Approximately 40% of the sample (n= 484) reported a high frequency and high severity of climate worry. Among these, one-third (n= 153) scored above the cutoff for significant impairment on the WSAS. Individuals in this group (high severity and frequency of climate worry as well as significant functional impairment) were more likely to experience depressed mood and sleep problems and were more interested in receiving support, specifically concerning strategies for worry management and sustainable behavior change.ConclusionsUsing an established measure of functional impairment, we found an association of climate worry with functional impairment and PEBs. Importantly, as there is a perceived need for support in individuals with impairment due to climate worry, interventions targeting this specific subgroup should be developed.

Breastfeeding is hypothesised to benefit child health and cognitive functioning by providing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are essential for brain development. In 2007, Caspi et al.found evidence in two cohorts for an interaction between genetic variation in theFADS2gene (a gene involved in fatty acid metabolism) and breastfeeding on IQ. However, subsequent studies have provided mixed evidence for the existence of an interaction. We investigated the relationship between genetic variation in theFADS2region, breastfeeding, and their interaction in up to 335,650 individuals from the UK Biobank. We tested for the interaction over a range of cognitive functioning tests, as well as educational attainment and other traits thought to be influenced by breastfeeding, including cardiometabolic traits, number of offspring, and atopic allergy.FADS2alleles associated with an increase in docosahexaenoic acid in blood serum (the C allele of rs174575) were associated with decreased verbal-numerical reasoning (\(p=2.28\times {10}^{-5}\)) and triglycerides (\(p=1.40\times {10}^{-41}\)), increased number of offspring (\(p=3.40\times {10}^{-5}\)), total cholesterol (\(p=5.28\times {10}^{-36}\)), HDL (\(p=1.42\times {10}^{-51}\)), and LDL cholesterol (\(p=1.46\times {10}^{-21}\)). We observed no evidence of an interaction in any of the traits, regardless of the modelling strategy on any cognitive or non-cognitive traits. We postulate that the previous positive findings are likely to be spurious, perhaps due to lack of appropriate control for latent population structure.

Time-out is an empirically supported component of parenting interventions for child conduct problems; however, it is receiving increasing criticism among parents and some practitioners. This study aimed to investigate practitioners’ use and acceptability of time-out for child conduct problems; examine whether perceived effectiveness and knowledge of evidence-based parameters of time-out implementation influence use and acceptability of time-out; and explore practitioners’ perceptions about alternatives to time-out. One hundred and ten Australian and New Zealand practitioners who have worked with children and families completed an online survey investigating their use and acceptability of time-out for children with conduct problems. Results showed that 55.5% of the sample have used timeout, with 38.0% considered current TO users. Acceptability of the strategy varied, with some practitioners critical of time-out. Increased knowledge of evidence-based parameters of time-out implementation was associated with increased frequency of time-out use and acceptability, while perceived effectiveness was associated with increased acceptability only. Practitioners perceived a number of other parenting strategies as effective alternatives to time-out. These findings have important implications for improving practitioners’ implementation of time-out with parents of children with conduct problems.

This article, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie (ZPS), underlines the theory of mentalizing as a multidisciplinary point of reference for all psychotherapy methods. It helps to explain the therapeutic effects of Psychodrama and Katathym Imaginative Psychotherapy (KIP) on the basis of an inherently systematic theory. The authors point out similarities and differences between the two methods and ask two questions to KIP therapists at the end.

This article, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziomterie (ZPS), describes applications of one-to-one psychodrama in a particularly interesting individual supervision. A professional conflict between the supervisee and her superior (manager) turned out to be profound. The key to the solution lay in uncovering transgenerational traces in the client’s family history, which had their roots in the complex structure of a socialist society. The use of the psychodramatic interview technique as well as knowledge about the ‘creative circle’, empty chair work, role reversal, doubling and the use of soft toys were helpful. The work revealed parts of a ‘post-socialist personality’. It is particularly difficult for them to experience themselves as independent in a conflict, to show themselves and to assert themselves. Instead, aggressive impulses tend to be expressed in a submissive or paradoxical manner. In addition to describing the use of specific psychodramatic techniques, a link is made to Fonagy’s concept of ‘mentalisation’, which sheds light on the underlying effectiveness of the use of one-to-one psychodrama in supervision.

ObjectivesResearch suggests that self-compassion, characterized by an open and caring attitude toward oneself during challenging situations, can serve as a protective factor against mental health challenges. In research and clinical practice, self-compassion is typically assessed using the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). Although the short form of the SCS (SCS-SF) has been studied in Sweden, the full SCS remains relatively unexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Swedish translation of the SCS in a university student population.MethodWe assessed internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and factor structure using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM). Additionally, we assessed the concurrent validity of the SCS by correlating it with perceived stress and alcohol consumption.ResultsThe results of the CFA and ESEM analyses indicated adequate fit for the 6-factor model, whereas the 1-factor and 2-factor models showed inadequate fit. The 1-bifactor and 2-bifactor ESEM analyses also indicated adequate fit, but the corresponding CFA analyses did not converge. As expected, self-compassion correlated negatively with perceived stress and alcohol consumption.ConclusionOur findings support the reliability of the Swedish version of the SCS. These psychometric properties are comparable to those of the original version. This validation is essential for its use in Swedish research and clinical contexts.PreregistrationThis study was not preregistered.

There is evidence that children with autism/autistic traits have higher risks of incontinence and constipation, but no studies have examined this in a large community-based cohort. Aim/Research question: are autistic traits and diagnosed autism prospectively associated with increased odds of incontinence and constipation in children and adolescents? This was a population-based cohort study based on data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n = 4233–4490 at age 9 years; n = 3403–3697 at age 14). We used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations of parent-reported autistic traits (sociability, repetitive behaviours, social-communication, coherence) (at ages 3–9 years) and autism with incontinence (bedwetting, daytime-wetting, soiling) and constipation (parent-reported at age 9, self-reported at age 14). We adjusted for parity, maternal age at delivery, child’s sex and developmental level, maternal depression, and anxiety (antenatal and postnatal), and indicators of family socioeconomic status. Social-communication and speech coherence difficulties showed the strongest associations with incontinence, e.g., adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between social-communication difficulties and daytime-wetting was 2.21 (1.47–3.32) and for coherence was 2.34 (1.60–3.43). The odds of soiling were also higher in children with social-communication (OR: 1.88, 95% CI 1.28–2.75) and coherence difficulties (OR: 2.04, 95% CI 1.43–2.93). Diagnosed autism was only associated with an increase in the odds of daytime-wetting (OR: 3.18, 95% CI 1.44–7.02). At 14 years, there was less evidence of associations between autistic traits and incontinence but there was evidence of associations between autistic traits and constipation: social-communication (OR: 1.68, 95% CI 1.13–2.49), coherence difficulties (OR: 1.64, 95% CI 1.11–2.41). Early assessment and treatment of incontinence/constipation should be considered for children with autistic traits.

The impact of career adaptability on turnover intention has been inconsistent and inadequately explained. Drawing on career construction theory, this study hypothesizes that career adaptability influences turnover intention indirectly through job dissatisfaction, exhibiting a U-shaped relationship. Specifically, moderate levels of career adaptability are hypothesized to reduce turnover intention by decreasing job dissatisfaction. Furthermore, this study proposes that age may serve as a significant moderator, impacting the relationships among career adaptability, job dissatisfaction, and turnover intention. To validate these hypotheses, a three-wave time-lagged study involving 349 employees from Chinese firms demonstrated that career adaptability exerts a curvilinear effect on job dissatisfaction, which in turn nonlinearly mediated the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intention. Additionally, age moderated these relationships. The data supported these hypotheses. This paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

Childhood emotional maltreatment is a crucial risk factor for gratitude in adolescents. However, previous research has not investigated the effects of two types of emotional maltreatment (i.e., emotional abuse and emotional neglect) on gratitude, and explored the underlying mechanisms. To address existing research gaps, this study investigated how childhood emotional maltreatment affected adolescent gratitude, as well as the potential role of parent-child attachment in the Chinese context. A total of 491 Chinese adolescents from a public high school (Mage= 16.19 years,SD= 0.50; 60.5% female) participated in this 10-month, three-wave longitudinal study. The path analysis revealed that cumulative childhood emotional maltreatment and childhood emotional neglect at T1 predicted lower levels of gratitude at T3, while childhood emotional abuse did not. Additionally, parent-child attachment at T2 mediated the relationship between cumulative childhood emotional maltreatment at T1 and gratitude at T3. These findings underscore the enduring negative impact of childhood emotional maltreatment on adolescent gratitude and highlight the crucial role of parent-child attachment in this relationship.

Maltreated adolescents placed in the out-of-home care (OHC) system often experience multiple adversities, which are associated with many deleterious outcomes. The present study investigated the longitudinal effects of cumulative adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on internalizing and externalizing problems among adolescents in OHC, as well as the extent to which emotion dysregulation can explain the links between exposure to multiple adversities and problematic behavioral outcomes over time. One hundred and sixty-two adolescents (Mage= 13.11 years, 90 females) who were placed in OHC in Singapore self-reported on their adversities experienced and symptoms of emotion dysregulation at baseline, as well as internalizing and externalizing problems in two consecutive waves. Path analyses indicated that cumulative ACEs were positively associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems at Wave 1, which in turn were positively related to internalizing and externalizing problems at Wave 2. Emotion dysregulation at Wave 1 partially explained the paths. These findings highlight the importance of addressing emotion dysregulation and the associated internalizing and externalizing problems in early interventions for adolescents in OHC to mitigate the risks of deteriorating mental health and promote positive outcomes.

The escalating prevalence of shift work among female intern nurses in China necessitates a nuanced exploration of its impact on fatigue and insomnia symptoms. While prior studies acknowledge the coexistence of these distresses in shift workers, a detailed understanding of their inter-connectedness at the symptom level is lacking. This study delves into the network dynamics of fatigue and insomnia symptoms, aiming to unravel the changes before and after the initial shift work transition among female intern nurses. Through three waves of surveys conducted at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months post-transition, we employed the 11-item Chalder Fatigue Scales for fatigue assessment and three items aligned with the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for insomnia evaluation. Network analysis was conducted to estimate centrality and bridge centrality, comparing network properties before and after the shift work transition. Notably, "Difficulty starting things," "Difficulty maintaining sleep," and "Sleepy or drowsy" emerged as central symptoms with higher centrality indices post-transition, exhibiting significant differences compared to the pre-shift work period. The gradual strengthening of the global fatigue-insomnia network further underscores the evolving dynamics following the transition to shift work. This study accentuates the pivotal role of these three symptoms in activating or being activated within the fatigue-insomnia network among female intern nurses post-shift work transition. Consequently, we propose the development of targeted prevention and intervention strategies to alleviate fatigue and insomnia symptoms in female intern nurses navigating their first-time shift work experience from a network perspective.

ObjectivesIn this qualitative study, we explored Dutch secondary vocational schoolteachers’ prior expectations of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training. We report on their short- and long-term experiences regarding mental health outcomes and personal or mindfulness/prosocial competencies.MethodBetween September 2016 and June 2020, we interviewed 32 teachers participating in a cluster randomised controlled trial prior to partaking in a MBSR training (T0); 27, immediately after the training (T1); and 16, 9 months after finishing the training (T3). No interviews were held on T2, 3 months after finishing the training. Qualitative data was analysed using directed content analysis.ResultsAnalysis of the data at T0resulted in five themes regarding the participants’ prior expectations related to the MBSR training. Data analysis at T1and T3resulted in 10 themes regarding their experiences, four of which were the same as at T0: one mental health outcome (i.e. stress and unpleasant feelings) and three personal competencies (i.e. being in the present, taking distance, and recognising and changing dysfunctional patterns). The fifth "other" theme at T0was knowledge of mindfulness and of mindfulness skills. Six additional themes emerged related to a new mental health outcome (i.e. inner calmness and pleasant feelings) and five personal competencies (i.e. being aware, concentration, acceptance and non-judgment, communicating, and showing compassion towards yourself and others).ConclusionOur results suggest that MBSR can reduce teachers’ stress, increase inner calmness, and foster mindfulness and prosocial competencies.PreregistrationThe trial was registered with the Dutch Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl): NL5581 (July 2016).

Under high-pressure situations, complex cognition and behavior frequently exhibit performance decrements, commonly known as choking under pressure. Complex cognition and behavior are primarily composed of three core components: behavior execution, inhibition, and switching. However, choking does not stem from decreases in all behavior components but primarily from failures in inhibition and switching. This study aims to further investigate whether performance pressure reduces performance in inhibition and switching and whether cue priming can alleviate choking on these two behaviors. Participants were assigned at random to the pressure group or the control group. Subsequently, they completed a modified version of the behavior variation task, during which they were instructed to make executive, inhibitory, or switching responses to forthcoming stimuli based on prior cues. The previous cues were categorized into three types: positive cues correctly indicating subsequent target behavior, negative cues incorrectly indicating subsequent behavior, and no cues. Results showed that performance pressure did not decrease performance in behavior execution, but had a negative impact on inhibition and switching. Importantly, positive cues were found to mitigate performance decrements in inhibition and switching, while negative cues or no cues did not affect choking in either behavior. Our results offer support for the distraction theory. These findings offer new perspectives on understanding the causes of choking and developing successful intervention approaches.

Shame and guilt are universal emotions meant to elicit socially approved behaviors and inhibit antisocial behavior. Excessive feelings of shame and guilt—shame especially—are linked to various destructive behaviors, difficulties in emotion regulation, maladaptive personality traits, psychological difficulties, and negative impacts on treatment outcomes. These make it especially important to have a valid instrument to evaluate the mechanisms related to these emotions. No validated self-report instrument measuring generalized shame and guilt was available in Norwegian. The Personal Feelings Questionnaire (PFQ-2) is designed to measure the level of generalized shame and guilt. This project’s aim was to translate the PFQ-2 into Norwegian and evaluate the clinical utility and psychometric properties of a Norwegian version of the PFQ-2. Data were collected from students at a local university college in Norway (N= 320, age:M= 25.4,SD= 8) and patients at a local outpatient psychiatric hospital (N= 53, age:M= 31.4,SD= 10.43). To be able to evaluate the factor structure of the Norwegian version of the PFQ-2, the dataset was divided in two by random selection with a 50/50 split. First an Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on one half of the sample (N= 180) and then a Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the other half (N= 193). According to the EFA the factor structure was similar to the original factor structure, with the exception of one item (item 6). Confirmatory factor analysis showed a good goodness of fit for the two factors measuring shame and guilt. The internal consistency was high in both subscales (shame, α = 0.818, and guilt, α = 0.834). The instrument showed further adequate construct validity, where the clinical sample experienced greater shame than the community sample (M= 17,SD= 6.887 vs.M= 13,SD= 5.311) and stronger guilt (M= 18,SD= 5.248 vs.M= 14,SD= 15.210). The subscales correlated with other constructs, as expected. The PFQ-2—with the suggested adjustment of moving one item (item 6) from the shame scale to the guilt scale—can be used to evaluate the levels of feelings of shame and guilt among adults in Norway.

I conducted a qualitative study to explore the unknown resistance experience and gender equality truth of transgenders in Punjab, Pakistan, considering rulings on transgender laws made by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2018. The literacy rate in the transgender community is meager, so data was gathered through extensive interviews to document the study participants’ subjective evaluation using the purposive sampling method. The thematic analysis demonstrates how society has compromised on mental health and gender equality of transgenders, but why transgenders are living their lives with hope? Findings revealed that individual resilience, religious beliefs, cruel optimism, and psychological resilience are the major factors that contribute positively to transgenders’ lives at the social and psychological levels. The research goal is to compile and emphasize research findings that would guide practical interventions to enhance the resilience of transgenders and mitigate mental health vulnerabilities. The study will also contribute progressively to transgender literature and develop real-world solutions and policies that may be used at the communal level across Pakistan.

A growing number of families in the US are caring for children with identified disabilities. As demonstrated in previous studies, there is reason to be concerned about the economic well-being of children with disabilities and their families. However, much of the existing evidence is drawn from older data that do not reflect recent increases in disability diagnoses or relevant economic and policy changes. Using recent nationally representative data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we offer updated evidence on the economic well-being of households of children with disabilities. Our regression models suggest that families with a child with a disability are more likely to experience food insecurity, and, on average, have lower income-to-poverty ratios than other households with children. We discuss implications for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers.

COVID-19 arrived in Spain during times of great political turmoil. General elections held in November 2019 resulted in a weak left-leaning coalition government and a highly polarized two-bloc party system; this set the stage for daily political confrontation on how to “best” manage the COVID-19 crisis. This study sought experimental evidence on the factors accounting for political polarization regarding the government’s implementation of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Participants (147 leftists, 162 rightists) were randomly assigned to a control or two experimental conditions, wherein they were induced to believe that individuals holdingfavorableorunfavorableattitudes towards NPIs were generally more analytical and open-minded. The extent to which participants believed the information presented in the experimental manipulation was thought to depend on motivated reasoning, on whether such information was congenial to their political ideology and related stance on NPIs. The results revealed that, (1) compared to leftists, rightists held stronger conspiracy beliefs regarding vaccines and COVID-19, religious beliefs, and psychological reactance towards NPIs, and less beliefs in science and open-minded thinking about evidence; (2) leftists and rightists were equally motivated to view individuals of opposite political ideology as less analytical and open-minded, (3) rightists reported less favorable attitudes towards NPIs and lower trust in the government than leftists; (4) motivated reasoning partly accounted for political polarization, widening the gap on attitudes towards NPIs and trust in government between leftists and rightists in the experimental (not control) conditions.

As a set of fundamental beliefs that underlie social attitudes and behaviors, social axioms (i.e., social cynicism, fate control, reward for application, religiosity, and social complexity) play a central role in how individuals maintain self-esteem and life satisfaction when encountering challenges and adversities in the social world. Existing knowledge regarding the impact of social axioms on psychological well-being is inconclusive, and there is a lack of longitudinal research to investigate whether social axioms are associated with psychological well-being over time. Most previous studies focused on the influence of social axioms on cognitive aspects of well-being (e.g., life purpose and self-esteem), but the affective aspects (i.e., positive and negative feelings) have been seldom investigated. To address this research gap, we conducted a two-wave survey among 333 Chinese university students and found that the baseline social axioms predicted the follow-up psychological well-being. Social cynicism was negatively related to flourishing and positive feelings, and positively related to negative feelings. Fate control was positively related to flourishing and positive feelings. Gender played a moderating role between social cynicism and flourishing. The findings gain our understanding of how social axioms affect psychological well-being over time and inspire new ideas for emotion regulation and well-being promotion.

Mindfulness-based interventions are increasingly utilized not only to enhance health and wellness in the face of disease and disorder but also to manage stress, anxiety, and daily worries. However, their application has been limited among diverse populations. A Special Section ofMindfulnesshighlights emerging research focused on inclusivity, diversity, equity, and accessibility in mindfulness-based interventions, as well as studies on child, parent, and family well-being. These studies provide valuable insights into theoretical issues, the need for culturally tailored mindfulness interventions for specific groups, and how such programs can be developed organically and collaboratively among researchers, participants, and community partners. The emerging field of mindfulness research within the context of diversity can advance further if research decisions are guided by established scientific principles.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, some psychological changes have been tracked and reported across the world. Post-COVID-19 freshman university students can be classified as generation Z. The aim of this study was to examine changes in moral and moral-related variables among Iranian Freshman University students in generation Z compared with generation Y, in the post-COVID-19 era. Variables, including prosocial behaviors, types of prosocial moral reasoning, dimensions of moral identity and religiosity, identity styles, empathy, and social desirability, were assessed among 212 freshman students at Salman Farsi University of Kazerun in 2014. However, another assessment of those variables by the same measures and methods was performed among 114 similar students in 2022. Social desirability and lie/nonsense responses were statistically controlled by multiple analysis of covariance and partial correlation methods. Among the post-COVID group, there was less total prosocial moral reasoning, hedonistic, approval-oriented and internalized prosocial moral reasoning, normative identity, symbolization of moral identity, public prosocial behavior, and total, ideological and experimental religiosity; additionally, there was more needs-oriented and stereotypic prosocial moral reasoning, informational identity, altruistic prosocial behaviors, consequential and ritualistic religiosity and empathy. There were different correlations among the two groups, whereas religiosity and its dimensions were positively correlated with many moral variables in the 2014 group, the correlations were negative in the 2022 group. The findings indicate that in this Iranian post-COVID-19 generation Z, sentimental aspects (e.g., empathy and altruism) of morality increased and that rational (e.g., prosocial moral reasoning) or traditional (e.g., religiosity) aspects decreased.

PurposeEarthquakes have serious psychosocial and emotional effects on children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their parents. The limited number of studies investigating the earthquake experience of children with ASD and their parents indicates a need to improve existing research in this area. The aim of this study was to assess parents’ experiences with their children after the earthquake and their reactions to the earthquake.MethodsThis study was subjected to analysis via both phenomenological and thematic analysis methods on the basis of the results of semistructured interviews with the parents of 21 children with ASD who were receiving their education in special education and rehabilitation centers.ResultsTwo principal themes were discerned: the first theme, entitled Post-Eartquake Responses in Children and the second, entitled Parents’ Earthquake Experiences and Coping Strategies, were identified. Earthquakes had a significant effect on children’s bodily, behavioural and emotional responses. In addition, parents were compelled to devise a range of coping strategies to manage their emotional responses to the earthquake and to facilitate their children’s access to constrained educational opportunities and adapt to evolving social dynamics.ConclusionIn disaster situations, access to multidisciplinary support programs for children diagnosed with ASD and their families is highly important. These programs, designed through collaboration across various fields of expertise, can offer comprehensive solutions to the emotional, social, and physical challenges faced by children and their families.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on people’s life, affecting social and economic conditions, population dynamics, politics, and cultural activities. This study investigates how COVID-19 affects married people’s fertility preferences. It also analyzes the preferences of married persons in Bangladesh with and without COVID-19. The study hypothesizes that persons afflicted with the pandemic choose to have more children than uninfected ones. A survey questionnaire and in-depth interview questions were used to gather pertinent data via snowball sampling from 200 infected and uninfected individuals residing in Sylhet City Corporation, Bangladesh, who were between the ages of 15 and 50. The study employed a mixed method strategy, including quantitative analysis (binary logistic regression), ANOVA testing, Chi-Square testing, and thematic analysis of qualitative data to examine the association between COVID-19 and fertility decisions. The results of the study show that the pandemic significantly affects people’s reproductive preferences, in particular their desire to have or not to have children in the future. In addition, compared with people who are not infected with COVID-19, people who have been infected are more likely to want to have children in the future. The study also shows that people - married couples in particular - may think twice before choosing to have children if they suffer the adverse consequences of an unforeseen shock such as a pandemic in the future. By examining the socioeconomic and cultural context of Bangladesh, this study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced fertility preferences. By addressing demographic shifts during and after the pandemic, it offers important insights for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals. Additionally, this study will advance knowledge of how pandemics alter reproductive desires globally and make results available for future cross-regional comparisons.

This study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the Quiet Quitting Scale (QQS) among healthcare workers. After completing the language validation, the psychometric properties of the QQS were tested on a sample of 542 healthcare workers from two hospitals in Turkey. Convergent validity was examined using the Burnout Measure-Short Version (BMS). The reliability of the scale was evaluated through internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and split-half reliability. Factor analysis confirmed the one-dimensional structure of the QQS with its seven items. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.81, the intraclass correlation coefficient for the total score was 0.91, and the Spearman-Brown coefficient for split-half reliability was 0.80. Additionally, the test-retest reliability was found to be high. A correlation coefficient of 0.79 between the QQS and BMS confirmed the scale’s convergent validity. These results suggest that the Turkish version of the QQS is a valid and reliable tool for measuring quiet quitting behavior in healthcare workers. Further research with different sample groups is recommended.

The importance of data sharing in organizational science is well-acknowledged, yet the field faces hurdles that prevent this, including concerns around privacy, proprietary information, and data integrity. We propose that synthetic data generated using machine learning (ML) could offer one promising solution to surmount at least some of these hurdles. Although this technology has been widely researched in the field of computer science, most organizational scientists are not familiar with it. To address the lack of available information for organizational scientists, we propose a systematic framework for the generation and evaluation of synthetic data. This framework is designed to guide researchers and practitioners through the intricacies of applying ML technologies to create robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data. Additionally, we present two empirical demonstrations using the ML method of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to illustrate the practical application and potential of synthetic data in organizational science. Through this exploration, we aim to furnish the community with a foundational understanding of synthetic data generation and encourage further investigation and adoption of these methodologies. By doing so, we hope to foster scientific advancement by enhancing data-sharing initiatives within the field.

This study explores the interplay between Fantastic Reality Ability (FRA), assessed using the FRAME scale, and playfulness, measured with the OLIW-S, in relation to cognitive emotion regulation strategies among 298 Israeli adults. Participants completed self-report measures evaluating FRA, playfulness, and emotion regulation processes. Results revealed robust positive associations between FRA and various facets of playfulness, and specific connections to adaptive emotion regulation. Particularly, higher levels of FRA coping and lighthearted playfulness emerged as significant predictors of adaptive emotion regulation, while maladaptive regulation showed associations with lower FRA control and distinct playfulness facets. These findings highlight the potential of cultivating imaginative capabilities and embracing playful approaches to bolster emotional resilience and adaptive coping strategies during challenging circumstances and crises. Practical implications for interventions aimed at enhancing psychological well-being are discussed, emphasizing the integration of FRA and playfulness in developing effective coping strategies.

BackgroundPositive marital relations are crucial for healthy family functioning, whereas conflict-ridden marital relations are linked to children’s adjustment problems. According to the Emotional Security Theory, destructive interparental conflict leads to children’s emotional insecurity, impacting their adjustment.ObjectiveThis three-wave longitudinal study examined the temporal associations between preschool children’s reactions to interparental conflict, interparental conflict and children’s behavioral problems in Japan.MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal three-wave study with Japanese parents of children at three time points: aged 3 (Time 1), 4 (Time 2), and 5 (Time 3). Children’s reactions to interparental conflict at Time 2 were assessed using the Security in the Marital Subsystem-Parent Report, which includes subscales for overt emotional reactivity, behavioral dysregulation, overt avoidance, and overt involvement.ResultsOur findings revealed a positive association between behavioral dysregulation at Time 2 and internalizing problems at Time 3. However, no significant association was found between behavioral dysregulation and externalizing problems. Emotional reactivity was not associated with behavioral problems or interparental conflict. Differences in age ranges across studies may account for the variance in findings.ConclusionsThis longitudinal study highlights the importance of focusing on behavioral dysregulation in preschool children as a factor associated with the relationship between interparental conflict and internalizing problems over time. Emotional reactivity may not serve as a reliable indicator of behavioral problems or interparental conflict in Japanese contexts. These findings underscore the need for culturally sensitive approaches in assessing children’s responses to interparental conflict and their potential associations with child development over time.

Research on alphabetic reading presents conflicting findings concerning the timing of orthographic and meaning processes in reading morphologically complex words. Chinese characters offer distinct visual cues for morphemes, enabling straightforward manipulations to examine orthographic and meaning processes. Guided by the Character-Word Dual Function model, we report four priming experiments that test how a reader’s lexical quality impacts the emergence of orthographic and semantic priming effects in reading Chinese compounds. We conducted comparisons between native Chinese speakers and Chinese L2 learners, who vary in their quality of lexical representations. By manipulating the semantic transparency of prime-target pairs, we distinguished meaning from orthographic effects. The emergence of these effects was revealed by varying prime exposure durations. Orthographic effects emerged at shorter exposures for both L1 and L2 readers. However, meaning effects appeared at longer exposure durations only for L1 readers. These results confirm the generality of the orthography-first emergence of morphological effect in reading Chinese and suggest that readers’ access to morphological meaning relations increases with experience.

This article explores the integration of Jessica Benjamin’s concepts of ‘mutual recognition’ and ‘the third’ into child-parent psychotherapy (CPP), a relationship-based trauma-informed dyadic intervention model rooted in attachment theory. Despite the significance of caregiver-child relationships in trauma response, Benjamin’s work remains underutilized in the CPP literature. This article uses a case illustration to demonstrate how incorporating Benjamin’s concepts enriches CPP interventions that address the relational impact of trauma on young children. Three strategies are outlined to cultivate thirdness within CPP, drawing from clinical material: exploring trauma and complementarity, distinguishing play from reality, and working with the clinician’s subjectivity. The article illustrates how the utilization of Benjamin’s concepts can complement CPP and how emphasizing the intersubjective dynamic between parent and child, enhancing parental subjectivity, and prioritizing the repair of recognition breakdowns can support clinicians in advancing the therapeutic goals of CPP.

Psychological research on mindfulness has often focused on the effects of mindfulness training, such as clinical application, rather than on the meaning of mindfulness itself as taught in various spiritual, philosophical, and medical traditions. Mindfulness is often seen as a general training in attentional awareness. From a Buddhist perspective, this approach does not allow for the effective solution of deep-rooted problems arising from a deluded state of mind, which requires insight into the nature of mind. In order to apply the practice of mindfulness as a soteriological path, a precise understanding of the full range of functions of mindfulness and the judgmental mind is essential. To this end, this study explores the relevant definitions and levels of this practice in the context of Buddhist models of mind. This paper provides a profound analysis of early Indian Buddhist sources such as theFour Foundations of Mindfulnessand later Tibetan Buddhist presentations, in particular those of the Kagyu lineage, such as theDistinction between Consciousness and Wisdomby the 3rd Karmapa Rangjung Dorje (1284–1339). Buddhist epistemology and meditation instructions offer various mind maps and discuss the steps in the process of perception, based on the application of mindfulness, to overcome deluded states of mind and develop highest wisdom. The theoretical and practical findings are intended to be helpful in integrating traditional Buddhist models of mindfulness and the judging mind, including issues of health and happiness, with our modern understanding of cognitive processes as described in applied psychology.

A growing body of research suggests that the development of preschoolers’ self-control in intergenerational coparenting families is related to the parent-grandparent coparenting relationship. However, little is known about their bidirectional association and the mechanism. This study aimed at investigating the longitudinal interrelationship between mother-grandmother coparenting relationship and preschoolers’ self-control, and exploring the role of mother-child attachment. A total of 280 Chinese intergenerational coparenting families involved in this study with a one-year cross-lagged design. Mother-grandmother coparenting relationship, preschoolers’ self-control, and mother-child attachment were measured at each stage of the year (T1, T2, and T3). Results indicated that mother-grandmother coparenting relationship positively predicted mother-child attachment, and mother-child attachment positively predicted preschoolers’ self-control. Although we did not find the direct association between mother-grandmother coparenting relationship and preschoolers’ self-control, our findings indicated that mother-grandmother coparenting relationship was indirectly related to preschoolers’ self-control through mother-child attachment. Additionally, we found a longitudinally bidirectional relationship between mother-child attachment and preschoolers’ self-control. This study extends our understanding of the relationship between intergenerational coparenting relationship and child development and provides implications for improving the parenting quality in intergenerational coparenting families.

Existing literature primarily concentrates on the early stages of mobile device adoption, neglecting the investigation of how differentiated characteristics of mobile social media influence users’ perceived values and outcomes after acceptance. Consequently, the principal objective of this research is to empirically examine the associations among the fundamental characteristics of mobile social media (i.e., interactive characteristic, informational characteristic, and personalized characteristic), perceived values (i.e., functional value and experiential value), and final consequences, especially user loyalty and positive WOM. Using uses and gratifications theory as a foundation, the current research proposes a conceptual model that investigates the key factors that determine individuals’ loyalty and positive WOM on mobile social media by incorporating two perceived value variables. The research employed a quantitative methodology, which consisted of conducting a survey with a total of 826 participants in mainland China. The data was processed and analyzed using structural equation modeling 25.0 software and Amos 25.0 software. Obtained results of this research demonstrated that informational characteristic and personalized characteristic significantly influence mobile social media users’ perceived functional value and experiential value. This study also indicated that experiential value influence user loyalty and positive WOM. However, interactive characteristic exhibits insignificant impacts on functional value. This article provides an essential contribution to the existing body of literature on mobile applications by presenting a comprehensive theoretical underpinning and practical implications that illuminate the ongoing utilization of mobile devices.

Mattering and purpose-in-life are key aspects of individuals’ perception of who they are and their relationships with others. However, their associations with personality, as well as sex differences within these associations, remain relatively unexplored. Three studies investigated, respectively, the correlation between mattering and purpose-in-life across sexes (N1= 906), their measurement invariance by sex and associations with the Big-Five (N2= 400), and with antagonistic traits (N3= 178), including potential sex differences in these associations. Study 1 found lower purpose-in-life in women compared to men, but no difference in mattering. Additionally, a positive and moderate correlation between mattering and purpose-in-life was observed, but no sex differences. Study 2 found higher factor covariance in men than women. Moreover, it showed that conscientiousness positively predicts mattering and purpose-in-life, neuroticism negatively predicts both, and agreeableness positively predicts purpose-in-life. Study 3 showed that primary and secondary psychopathy negatively predict mattering, grandiose narcissism positively predicts mattering and purpose-in-life, and secondary psychopathy negatively predicts purpose-in-life, in all cases showing no sex differences. These results highlight the importance of mattering and purpose-in-life in personality research and intervention, offering insights for personality development by addressing dysfunctional perceptions and fostering personal and professional growth across various applied settings. For instance, in counseling, leveraging mattering and purpose-in-life could help clients strengthen their resilience and coping skills. In educational settings, mattering and purpose-in-life could support learners’ self-efficacy and improve educational outcomes. In organizational settings, they could drive change by enhancing individuals’ confidence, productivity, and leadership.

Recent evidence has suggested that valuing happiness to an extreme degree has a potential downside in Western but not in East Asian countries. We tested how valuing happiness relates to well-being in mainland China (N= 721) and Western countries (UK, US, and Canada) (N= 349) in two online survey studies. We predicted that pursuing happiness in a socially engaged yet flexible (i.e., feasible and achievable) way underlies a positive association between valuing happiness and well-being. Indeed, in study 1, a socially engaged definition of happiness mediated the relationship between valuing happiness and well-being in a Chinese sample. Specifically, increased valuing happiness was associated with a higher socially engaged definition of happiness, which in turn was related to higher well-being. Demonstrating the role of flexibility in pursuing happiness, Chinese participants reported more items overall and more feasible items to achieve happiness, though not more social items than participants in the Western sample). In study 2, we repeated the study during the Covid-19 lockdown in Chinese (N= 308) and Western (N= 185) samples and also tested if participants were able to adopt a mindset of flexibly pursuing happiness by adding a survey with social actions that were still feasible (e.g., a call instead of meeting in-person). We found the association holds in times of emotional stress and social restrictions in both samples, suggesting that people flexibly pursue social activities that relate to happiness. We propose that a socially engaged but also feasible and flexible way to pursue happiness is associated with higher well-being.

The present study qualitatively examined the experiences of caregivers of primary school children with and without SEN in relation to their socioemotional wellbeing and how they coped during the COVID-19 pandemic in England. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 22 London-based mothers of 5–12-year-old children, half of whom had children with Special Educational Needs (SEN). The interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, allowing for a comparative exploration of the experiences of mothers with children with SEN and those without. The analysis generated four themes:(1)opportunities(2)challenges(3)post-pandemic considerations(4)coping strategies. Findings showed that caregivers of both SEN and non-SEN children experienced several opportunities or challenges after the initial lockdown in 2020. Both groups of caregivers reported similar long-term experiences in terms of opportunities. However, almost all caregivers in SEN group reported distinctive challenges about support services and mental health decline. In terms of coping strategies, SEN mothers placed a greater emphasis on the importance of adapting to change and establishing new routines. They also used more mental health services for themselves and their children during lockdowns compared to non-SEN mothers. Regarding the post-pandemic considerations, almost all caregivers, regardless of their children’s SEN status, expressed significant concerns about future uncertainties. This study highlights the unique challenges and opportunities experienced by caregivers, particularly emphasizing the nuanced needs of SEN families. The findings underscore the necessity for robust mental health support frameworks and tailored support strategies to address these needs. Implications for future research include further exploration of long-term support mechanisms for SEN families and a broader investigation into the diverse coping strategies across different caregiver populations.

According to the schema model of self-control, repetitive self-control efforts falter due to the activation of a reduced vitality schema, resulting in increased motivation to conserve energy and reduced cognitive efforts. Building on these assumptions, we conducted two randomized controlled studies to examine the mental associations individuals form between subjective vitality, motivation to conserve energy, and motivation for cognitive effort. In both studies, the participants were presented with vignettes featuring fictitious characters described as either vital or non-vital. In Study 1 (N= 487), participants attributed higher motivation to conserve energy and lower cognitive motivation to the character described as having low subjective vitality. This finding indicates that participants seem to hold a vitality schema, in which perceived levels of vitality influence how cognitive resources are allocated. Furthermore, the motivation to conserve energy was found to partially mediate the relationship between subjective vitality and cognitive motivation, aligning with the schema model’s predictions. Study 2 (N= 449) successfully replicated the findings of Study 1 using different measures. Overall, the empirical evaluation of this sub-component of the schema model adds a crucial piece to the postulated causal chain, emphasizing the importance of schema-based approaches in self-control research and opening new perspectives for investigating the mechanisms of cognitive resource allocation. Our results provide a promising foundation for future studies to investigate the schema model at a behavioral level, as mental representations can be viewed as precursors that prompt individuals to translate their cognitive concepts into corresponding actions.

Despite abundant evidence that trait hope and trait gratitude predict higher well-being, there remained little research on whether these dispositions predict mental health among people living with financial challenges in real-life. Focusing on mothers (N= 462) in low-income families in Singapore, this study examined three questions. First, what hope-gratitude clusters would characterize the mother participants? Second, would the mothers’ trait hope and gratitude predict their depression and anxiety? Third, how might these dispositions moderate the relationships between economic hardship and depression and anxiety? Cluster analysis identified four naturally occurring clusters comprising high and low levels of both dispositions. Both dispositions negatively predicted depression and anxiety as expected. It was only among participants in clusters characterized by higher levels of trait hope - regardless of the level of trait gratitude - that the negative relationship between economic hardship and depression was non-significant. The relationships between economic hardships and both depression and anxiety were negative and significant in clusters with lower levels of trait hope regardless of trait gratitude. The results suggest that while trait hope and gratitude correlated negatively with depression and anxiety, trait gratitude does not appear to mitigate the negative relationships between economic hardship and both mental health outcomes and trait hope appears to reduce only the relationship between economic hardship and depression.

This study explores veiling from an adaptive perspective, examining how the practice may serve women’s interests. The mate-guarding theory of veiling proposes that veiling functions as a cultural adaptation, reducing women’s attractiveness to prevent mate poaching and control female sexuality. Using data from the World Values Survey across ten Muslim-majority countries, this study explores the relationship between the importance of veiling and marital status as well as the number of children, hypothesizing that married women and those with a higher number of children are more in need of paternal investment. The results indicate that veiling is more important for married women and those with more children, suggesting that veiling functions as an adaptive strategy to conform to male mate preferences and thereby potentially secure paternal investment. Higher religiosity was also positively associated with veiling, while higher education levels were negatively associated. The study contributes to the understanding of veiling as a complex adaptive behavior shaped by both social and reproductive factors.

ObjectivesRegulation of the heart by the brain is a vital function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and healthy ANS function has been linked to a wide range of well-being measures. Although there is evidence of mindfulness-meditation-related changes to brain functioning and heart functioning independently, few studies have examined the interaction between brain and heart functions in experienced meditators.MethodThis study compared measures of the brain–heart relationship between 37 experienced meditators and 35 non-meditators (healthy controls) using three different analysis methods: (1) the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP; thought to reflect neural sensitivity to interoceptive feedback); (2) the relationship between fronto-midline theta neural oscillations (fm-theta) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) in electrocardiogram activity (an estimate of vagally mediated heart rate variability); and (3) the correlation between heart rate wavelet entropy and electroencephalographic wavelet entropy—a measure of signal complexity.ResultsThe HEP analysis indicated that meditators showed a more central-posterior distribution of neural activity time-locked to the heartbeat (p< 0.001, partialη2= 0.06) than controls. A significant positive relationship was also found between fm-theta and RMSSD in meditators (F(2,34) = 4.18,p= 0.02,R2= 0.20) but not controls. No significant relationship was found between EEG entropy and ECG entropy in either group.ConclusionsThe altered distribution of evoked neural activity, and the correlation between brain and heart biomarkers of vagal activity suggests greater neural regulation and perhaps greater sensitivity to interoceptive signals in experienced meditators.

The practice of retrieval has been shown to be highly beneficial for memory retention, but it has seldom been compared with learning strategies other than repeated study. Here, we compared the benefits of retrieval practice (without feedback) with the benefits of two elaborative encoding tasks for word pair learning. Specifically, after studying series of randomly combined word pairs, participants performed an interactive-imagery (Experiments1–2) or sentence-generation task (Experiments3–5), retrieval practice, and a letter-counting or a rereading task. In Experiments1–4, the word pairs were shown after a 24-h interval for testing in its original form or with the second word replaced by the second word from another pair, and participants performed recognition (old/new) followed by associative memory tests (intact/rearranged). In Experiment5, memory was tested in a final cued-recall task administered shortly after initial learning. The interactive-imagery task was as beneficial as retrieval practice for recognition, but consistently more beneficial than retrieval for performance at the associative task. Sentence generation, on the other hand, produced greater performances than retrieval practice in recognition, associative memory, and cued-recall tests. These findings reveal that simple elaborative encoding tasks, such as imagining scenes or generating sentences, can be more beneficial for memory retention than retrieval practice without feedback.

Approximately 23% of adults in the USA do not engage in the recommended guidelines for physical activity, thus increasing their risk for developing various health-related diseases. Despite the importance of physical activity, previous research has primarily focused on increasing step count. A combination of interventions has been evaluated to increase physical activity such as self-monitoring, goal setting, feedback, and contingency management. However, research is needed to evaluate the effects of these interventions on increasing exercise. Thus, the current study aimed to increase the frequency of exercise sessions in three University students through the use of a treatment package consisting of choice, self-monitoring, goal setting, feedback, and contingency management plus a deposit contract. A nonconcurrent multiple baseline design across participants was used to assess the effectiveness of the treatment package. The results from this study demonstrated increases in minutes of aerobic activity per week during the intervention in comparison with baseline. The results add to the current body of the literature demonstrating that a treatment package consisting of choice, self-monitoring, goal setting, feedback, and contingency management plus a deposit contract may be successful in increasing aerobic physical activity. Future research may evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment package with other physical activity related behaviors and with various populations.

Associations between arithmetic and reading skills suggest that these important abilities may rely, at least in part, on shared neurocognitive processes. It has been argued that retrieval of arithmetic facts may rely on phonological processing; however, very few studies have explored this association using neural indices and whether it manifests similarly in children and adults. Here we examined event related potentials (ERPs) as an indirect neural correlate of arithmetic fact retrieval, and whether variability in ERP modulation is associated with individual differences in phonological processing (verbal working memory, rate of access, and phonological awareness). Arithmetic processing was examined in two samples with different levels of arithmetic expertise: (1) young adults (n= 24;Mage= 21.8 years); and (2) children (n= 25;Mage= 11.2 years). Participants were presented with simple multiplication equations that were correct or incorrect. Significant modulations of the ERPs by correctness were found at posterior electrodes in both samples, however, in different components. In adults a modulation of the P300 was observed, while for children the N400 response was modulated. For both children and adults, the size of the ERP modulation in posterior electrodes was associated with individual differences in verbal working memory. These results highlight an important distinction between behavioral outcomes and their underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. Additionally, they provide insight into how arithmetic processing evolves over the course of development.

This study aimed to a) discuss the neurobiological mechanisms of depersonalization as arising from activation at the brainstem level and b) assess the effectiveness of deep brain reorienting psychotherapy (DBR) with a patient presenting with depersonalization-derealization disorder (DDD). In the first part of the paper, we discuss verbal abuse as a severe form of relational trauma and how it can be connected to depersonalization. It is argued that suddenly aversive experiences engage the brainstem locus coeruleus in widespread noradrenergic activation of the thalamus and cortex such that the balance of functioning within the cortex becomes disturbed and a subjective experience of chronic depersonalization results. In the second part, the single-case study aims to provide initial evidence of how the patient experienced and responded to DBR therapy. Pre- and post-treatment measures consisted of instruments to measure depersonalization, social anxiety symptoms and quality of life. After 43 DBR sessions, the participant's depersonalization and comorbid symptoms decreased significantly. Patients with DDD may benefit from DBR. Future research is required to address generalizability to a larger population.

Previous research has shown that parental psychological aggression may change with children’s age, and individual differences existed in the developmental trajectories of parental psychological aggression within different families. However, most studies on the heterogeneous psychological aggression trajectories have focused solely on mothers or combined mothers’ and fathers’ data, with few studies separately exploring the unique trajectories of fathers and mothers and their predictors and outcomes within Chinese societies. Therefore, this study investigated the heterogeneous trajectories of paternal and maternal psychological aggression from middle childhood to early adolescence and their associations with child- and family-level predictors and outcomes in China. A total of 1137 Chinese families with children in grades 1–3 (Mage= 7.17;SDage= 0.95 at Time 1; 52.35% boys, 47.65% girls) participated in assessments at five time points, using 1-year internals in between. Latent class growth models were used to estimate the heterogeneous trajectories of paternal and maternal psychological aggression from ages 7 to 11 years. Logistic regression analyses were used to understand the child- and family-level predictors of these trajectories, and analysis of covariance was used to examine the outcomes of these trajectories. The findings revealed that three trajectories of paternal psychological aggression were identified: low-persistent (88.95%), high-decreasing (7.93%), and high-increasing-decreasing (3.12%) trajectories. Four trajectories of maternal psychological aggression were identified: low-persistent (86.17%), high-decreasing (5.94%), high-increasing-decreasing (4.08%), and low-increasing (3.81%) trajectories. Lower marital satisfaction, more psychological aggression experiences during childhood, and being a parent of a boy were risk factors for both paternal and maternal trajectories, while higher negative affectivity in children was a risk factor of maternal but not paternal trajectories. In addition, the high-increasing-decreasing trajectory for both fathers and mothers as well as the low-increasing trajectory for mothers predicted children’s more internalizing and externalizing problems. These findings highlight the importance of considering heterogeneity in understanding the developmental patterns of parental psychological aggression, their predictors, and cumulative effects on child development.

Exploring the driving mechanism of college students’ innovative behavior plays an important role in accelerating the current cultivation of talents in colleges and social development. Based on the results of in-depth qualitative interviews with 22 Chinese college students, this study adopts the procedural grounded coding method to summarize the pyramid model of college students’ innovative behavior in the three dimensions of innovative motivation, innovative cognition, and innovative behavior, and found that the factors driving college students’ innovative behavior are mainly autonomy and material factors, with motivational and mandatory factors supplementing them, while college students’ innovative behavior satisfy the needs for autonomy, competence, and belongingness. The results broaden the current theoretical research related to college students’ innovation and are of great practical significance in guiding the cultivation of innovative talents in colleges and universities.

In today’s competitive corporate climate, strategic human resource management (SHRM) requires a thorough grasp of employee perceptions of human resource practices (EPHRP) since EPHRP can significantly impact individual and organizational outcomes. However, research challenges remain in the operationalization and theorization of EPHRP, especially regarding the employment of different types of EPHRP measures, which prevents the understanding of EPHRP and the effectiveness of SHRM. Therefore, this study aims to review up-to-date EPHRP-related studies and understand how it has been operationalized and theorized in quantitative research. The current review employed Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Protocol 2020 to find English-written studies published before May 2024 that have investigated EPHRP. One hundred ten studies were synthesized and analyzed regarding the general characteristics of EPHRP research, the operationalization and theorization of the EPHRP construct. The results demonstrate an increasing interest and diversified approaches in studying EPHRP. However, results also reveal the ambiguity in EPHRP conceptualization, concerns in its operationalization and applications, as well as the lack of sufficient investigation of descriptive EPHRP and the predictors of EPHRP. Focusing on the operationalization and theorization of EPHRP, the study conducted a comprehensive review and provided insights into the issues of EPHRP measurement. Such investigations advance the understanding of EPHRP, offering valuable implications for both SHRM researchers and practitioners.

Despite the liberation and progressions of women all around the world in the twenty-first century, women keep on being under-addressed in administration positions. Women in independent India have changed all through history, but the post-industrial revolution and its positive effects were only made obvious to them in the last 35 years. Despite the ratio of women in India’s police forces rising, they still make up slightly more than 7% of the department’s all-around workforce. The job of women as chiefs included even those areas of work, which were prior viewed as unequivocally man’s spaces like the police association. The target of the review was to recognize the obstacles and hindrances common all around the world at variable degrees for female police and furthermore talk about the change in perspective in the impression of the overall population toward women as police. Current data reveal that most women in the police are concentrated in the lower ranks reflecting the dearth of females in key operational positions. The strategy of the review was a subjective evaluation of various examinations led in a few nations. The job of women staff in the police is very important. Though generally it was very limited but now with time, it has expanded and gained appreciation. The government additionally perceived the job that women police personnel played. The reason for this reality is that women police are proficient. For all kinds of people, women police personnel is vital. Men police can see just men’s wrongdoing; however, women can see all people both (crime) legally and typically both. At the point when women take part in law enforcement, at all levels and in all jobs, policing is more receptive to, and intelligent of, the local area it serves. The significant cooperation of women in policing activity viability improves local area trust and diminishes corruption.

Optimism and resilience may differ in their ability to predict various types of student stress, but they have yet to be directly compared within the U.S. higher education landscape. In this study, we directly compared the two traits to see which one would be a stronger predictor of academic stress. First-year college students (N= 355) completed an online study that measured their perceived academic stress, dispositional optimism, and dispositional resilience. Bivariate correlations showed that resilience and optimism were both negatively correlated with all four types of academic stress. Multiple regression showed that resilience was a stronger predictor than optimism for stress related to academic self-perceptions, whereas optimism was a better predictor than resilience for stress related to pressure to perform and time restraints, even when controlling for demographic and personality factors. These findings increase knowledge about the relationships between academic stress, resilience, and optimism and may be informative for future intervention research.

Artificial selection yielded four replicate high runner (HR) lines of mice that reached apparent selection limits (~ threefold increase in wheel revolutions per day vs. four control lines), despite maintenance of additive genetic variance. After 68 generations, we used animal models to test for changes in additive-genetic variances and covariance of the two measured components (average speed and duration) of running distance. We also attempted to break the selection limit by crossing two HR lines, then continuing directional selection on this hybrid line and on the two parental lines for nine generations. The genetic correlation between speed and duration was positive in the base population, but evolved to be negative in the two parental HR lines. Although heritability for both speed and duration (but not distance) increased in the hybrid line, their genetic correlation remained negative. Hybrid F1mice from generation 68 parents showed heterosis for running distance, which was lost in subsequent generations, and the hybrid line did not exceed the limit. Both male and female hybrids ran faster than parental lines for most generations, but running duration was intermediate or reduced, reflecting their negative genetic correlation. The evolved genetic trade-off between speed and duration may explain the inability for the hybrid line to break the selection limit for distance run, despite renewed additive genetic variance for at least one of its component traits.

In the era of the sharing economy, the issue of employee well-being is often overlooked, although it is a key measure of job satisfaction and organizational commitment. The human resource management of the platform is facing major changes in the external environment and internal structure, and the sharing employee management practices (SEMPs) arise at the historic moment. This study aims to explore the mediating role of organizational commitment and moderating role of job autonomy in the association between each dimension of SEMPs, that is platform support (SEMP1), platform incentive (SEMP2), platform constraint (SEMP3) on work well-being (WWB) in the context of platform organization. This study employed quantitative methods, focusing on designated drivers as the participants of the survey, and collected data from 218 questionnaires. The results show that, the three dimensions of SEMPs can positively affect the WWB of sharing employees through organizational commitment. Job autonomy actively moderates the relationship between platform support/ platform incentive and organizational commitment, and positively moderates the mediating role of organizational commitment in the relationship between platform support/ platform incentive and the WWB of sharing employees. These findings can help to expand the theoretical research related to human resource management in the context of the sharing economy, at the same time, it also provides practical guidance for platform enterprises to improve the WWB of sharing employees by optimizing management strategies.

BackgroundPrevious studies showed that lay people see modernization as a threat to social fabric because it will make people less warm and moral. The purpose of this paper is to describe lay people’s understanding of the effects of different types of modernization. Specifically, we checked how social, economic, technological and conventional development are expected to influence communion, agency and well-being in the future society.MethodsWe conducted three cross-sectional studies using online surveys. Prolific participant pool users over 18 years of age that held Canadian citizenship and resided in Canada were eligible to take part in the study in exchange for financial compensation. T-tests and linear regression analyses were conducted using SPSS statistical package.ResultsParticipants expected that people in future society will have lower well-being than today. Technological modernization was expected to decrease communion and well-being but increase agency in the future, while social modernization was expected to strengthen societal communion, agency and well-being.ConclusionLay people believe that different types of modernization will have different effects on society. Whereas technological progress is viewed ambivalently, social development is seen as uniformly positive for well-being of society. In order to counter pessimism about the future, policy makers should focus on social development while striving to mitigate negative social aspects of technological advancements.

Parents and children often engage in joint play—a domain where mothers and fathers are thought to exhibit disparate behaviors and impact child development via distinct mechanisms. However, little is known about the neural substrates of mother-child and father-child play. In this fMRI study, we sampled the brain activation of parents of preschoolers (N= 88) during a novel event-related adaptation of the virtual ball-tossing game “Cyberball.” Mothers (N= 40) and fathers (N= 48) played “Cyberball” ostensibly with their own and an unrelated child, who consecutively included, excluded, and reincluded parents. We found that overall, exclusion yielded comparable neural activations in mothers and fathers associated with mentalizing, saliency, and emotion processing. We also observed a parent gender effect in several brain areas. While mothers exhibited increased reward- and attention-related activity during inclusion, fathers displayed increased mentalizing-related activity during exclusion. Furthermore, we tested parents’ response to reinclusion, which revealed a selective decrease in reward-related activity. Finally, exploratory analyses showed that parental involvement was positively correlated with parental brain activity within attention- and mentalizing-related areas during inclusion, as opposed to other game phases, and that an anxious parenting style was associated with increased neural sensitivity for game events involving their own child. Overall, our study elucidates the common and distinct neural networks that mothers and fathers engage during play interactions with their children, supporting theories that postulate only a partial differentiation of paternal and maternal parenting systems.

Children exposed to family violence (i.e. child abuse and neglect and intimate partner violence) are often emotionally insecure in their relationship with their parents, and develop psychosocial problems. Emotional insecurity increases the likelihood of psychosocial problems, and may affect adjustment in other contexts (e.g., school). Among children exposed to family violence, emotional insecurity may indirectly affect psychosocial problems through well-being at school (school connectedness, well-being with teachers, and well-being with classmates), or well-being at school may moderate the association between emotional insecurity and psychosocial problems. Participants were 317 Dutch children aged 8–17 years (53.3% girls, mean age 12.7 years) and their parents, recruited through child protection services. Participants completed questionnaires on family violence, emotional insecurity, well-being at school, and psychosocial problems between June 2021 and August 2022. Analyses were conducted using Structural Equation Modeling. More emotional insecurity and less well-being at school were both related to more psychosocial problems, but emotional insecurity was not related to well-being at school. Emotional insecurity did not indirectly affect psychosocial problems through well-being at school (β = 0.01,p= .76) nor did well-being at school moderate (β = − .08,p= .14) the association between emotional insecurity and psychosocial problems in children exposed to family violence. This suggests that emotional insecurity and well-being at school each contribute independently to psychosocial problems. A longitudinal study should be conducted to fully understand how these aspects develop and relate in children exposed to family violence. Clinical support may focus on children’s emotional insecurity and well-being at school, in addition to reducing the violence.

It is hypothesized that cognitions influence the development of affective disorders. Depression and anxiety are prevalent in both adults and youth. The Children’s Automatic Thoughts Scale (CATS) assesses internalizing and externalizing negative automatic thoughts in children and adolescents. This study examined the psychometric properties– including factor structure, internal consistency and convergent validity– of the Slovenian version of CATS in a normative school sample (N= 754) of Slovenian adolescents aged 10 to 18. Additionally, the short-term stability of negative automatic thoughts over a three-month period was assessed in a subsample of 117 participants. Confirmatory factor analysis showed the best fit for the bifactor model, with one general and four specific factors (CFI = 0.963, TLI = 0.958, RMSEA = 0.045). Cronbach’s α and McDonald’s ω ranged from 0.81 to 0.96 for the total scale and subscales. The total score and subscales correlated significantly with the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale. The Slovenian version of CATS shows good psychometric properties in the school sample.

Narcissism is a well-established personality trait characterized by a tripartite structure that includes privilege/antagonism as the central feature, grandiosity/agentic extraversion, and vulnerability/neuroticism as phenotypic features. The relationship between narcissism and prosocial behavior (PsB) has been inconsistent in previous studies. To clarify the relationship between narcissism and PsB, we conducted a meta-analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that met the appropriate inclusion criteria. Given the distinct connotations and structures of the two primary types of narcissism: grandiose narcissism (GN) and vulnerable narcissism (VN), we performed separate meta-analyses for each, drawing from the relevant literature on PsB. For the analysis of VN-PsB, we included a total of 19 studies, 32 effect sizes, and a sample size of 6,536 individuals. The results indicated no significant negative correlation between PsB and VN (r= -0.08, 95% CI [-0.20, 0.05]). And the relationship between VN and PsB was moderated by methods of measuring PsB. In the analysis of GN-PsB, we included 59 studies, 198 effect sizes, and a sample size of 42,919 individuals. The results revealed a significant positive correlation between PsB and GN (r= 0.07, 95% CI [0.02, 0.12]). This positive association between GN and PsB remains robust across different ages, methods of measuring PsB, and cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, the relationship between GN and PsB was moderated by the types of GN; communal narcissism exhibited a significant positive correlation with PsB, and the strength of this correlation was notably greater than that between agentic narcissism and PsB.

BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic, declared by the World Health Organization in early 2020, rapidly escalated from a global health crisis to a significant public health issue worldwide. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive global overview of suicidal behavior and associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsAdhering to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, literature searches were conducted across five databases: Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Academic Search Complete. The review encompassed studies published from January 1, 2019, to November 29, 2023. A total of 286 studies met the inclusion criteria, offering a broad perspective on suicidal behaviors during the pandemic. The studies underwent quality assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal for Checklist for Prevalence Studies Scale (CACPSS).ResultsThe highest rates of suicidal behavior were observed in the Americas, Europe, and the Western Pacific Region, with China and the United States reporting significant cases. Key risk factors included demographic characteristics, mental health conditions, and social support factors. Suicidal ideation prevalence rates ranged significantly, with the highest in some regions exceeding 50%. Suicide attempts and completed suicides also showed considerable variation across different countries and regions.ConclusionThe findings emphasize the need for targeted mental health interventions and policies to reduce suicide risk, highlighting the multifaceted nature of suicidal behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comprehensive, multidisciplinary approaches are necessary to address this pressing concern, and understanding the interplay among diverse risk factors is crucial for developing effective prevention and intervention strategies.

From shopping to financial investment and life planning, intertemporal choice is everywhere in daily life. The psychological power theory based on the concept of luck has explored the influence of luck perception on an individual’s intertemporal choice. Study results show that compared to individuals feeling unlucky, Individuals feel lucky and choose larger & later option. Luck perception can affect the intertemporal choice through the working mechanism of positive illusion. Compared with individuals who perceive unlucky, individuals who perceive lucky will develop a positive illusion, with which they are more willing to choose larger & later option. In addition, the uncertainty tolerance of individuals can moderate the influence of luck perception on intertemporal choice. For individual with a low tolerance for uncertainty, the perception of luck will make them inclined to choose larger & later option, while the perception of unluck will make them inclined to choose smaller & sooner option. However, individuals with a high tolerance for uncertainty exhibit a weakened preference effect of luck perception on intertemporal choice.

The study investigates the mediating role of mindfulness in the relation between marriage role expectations, forgiveness and marital adjustment in a sample of 461 people that are at least 1 year married and leave in Turkey (67.5% female; age range: 18–50).Personal Information Formprepared by the researcher,Marriage Role Expectations Inventory (MREI),Forgiveness Scale,Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS-R)and The Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) were used for data collection. Descriptive statistics methods, Pearson correlation analysis, Independent Sample T-Test and Hayes Process mediation analysis were used for analysis. The findings show that equalitarian expectations are positively related to marital adjustment and mindfulness. Traditional expectations were found have a negative significant relationship with mindfulness. There is a significant positive relationship between forgiveness and marital adjustment. Traditional expectations had a positive relationship only with the unresponsiveness to internal experiences. Mindfulness mediates the relation between equalitarian expectations and marital adjustment in a positive direction. There are no studies on these variables in the literature. With the study, the need for a study examining the relations between these three variables was tried to be eliminated. This research fills a gap in the literature by providing an in-depth look at the role of mindfulness in marital adjustment. It reveals the importance of mindfulness and marriage role expectations. Mindfulness-based targeted interventions are necessary to enhance marital adjustment in married couples. By understanding individuals’ levels of mindfulness and marital role expectations, policymakers can develop actionable solutions to increase couples’ levels of mindfulness and improve marital adjustment.

The spatial numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect demonstrates that people respond faster to small numbers with their left hand and faster to large numbers with their right hand. The size congruity effect (SCE) refers to the fact that congruent trials between numerical values and physical sizes are faster than incongruent trials. Previous studies have found that the SNARC effect and SCE are independent when magnitudes or sizes are processed explicitly. This study aimed to explore whether number, size, and space are common and distinct mechanisms using an implicit parity judgment task. The results showed that the SNARC effect, SCE, and SNARC-like effect all co-existed. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between the SNARC effect and SCE, in which the SNARC effect in the SCE-congruent condition was larger than in the SCE-incongruent condition, whereas SCE merely emerged in the SNARC-compatible trials. However, participants responded to small numbers in large size faster than to large numbers in small size with the left hand in SCE-incongruent trials, which reflected that number-space mapping (SNARC effect) was stronger than size-space mapping (SNARC-like effect). These findings provide new evidence for A Theory of Magnitude (ATOM), which suggests that number, size, and space are associated with a common generalized magnitude system through distinct mechanisms.

The refugee experience is a known risk factor for psychological stress, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and somatic pain. However, the prevalence and comorbidity of these health outcomes in asylum seekers is not elucidated. Here we performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study in which the forensic medical evaluations of 453 globally representative US asylum seekers were analyzed. Outcomes included the prevalence of symptoms of psychological stress, CVD, somatic pain and their comorbidity. Symptoms of psychological stress, CVD and somatic pain were documented in 94%, 47% and 50% of participants, respectively; 46% reported both CVD and stress symptoms, and 31% reported all three. Palpitations, presyncope/syncope, stroke symptoms and chest pain were reported in 33%, 25%, 20% and 16% of individuals with CVD symptoms, respectively. Furthermore, both stress symptoms and pain symptoms were each strongly predictive of comorbid CVD symptoms. These findings indicate that asylum seekers experience a high burden of comorbid and interrelated psychological stress, CVD and somatic pain.

Drawing on Team Regulation Theory, we discuss how and when inclusive leadership impacts team innovation. Data were collected from 545 full-time employees in 119 teams using a 4-phase time-lag method. Path analysis and Bootstrapping simulation analyses were used to test the hypotheses. The results showed that inclusive leadership positively influenced team innovation, and team diversity climate and team reflexivity play a chain mediating role in the relationship between the two. Additionally, team career calling moderated the relationship between team diversity climate and team reflexivity, and the positive relationship between the two was stronger when team career calling was higher. These findings and their implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Word identification accuracy is modulated by many factors including linguistic characteristics of words (frequent vs. infrequent), listening environment (noisy vs. quiet), and listener-related differences (older vs. younger). Nearly, all studies investigating these factors use high-familiarity words and noise signals that are either energetic maskers (e.g., white noise) or informational maskers composed of competing talkers (e.g., multitalker babble). Here, we expand on these findings by examining younger and older listeners’ speech-in-noise perception for words varying in both frequency and familiarity within a simulated hospital noise that has important non-speech information. The method was inspired by the real-world challenges aging patients can face in understanding less familiar medical terminology used by healthcare professionals in noisy hospital environments. Word familiarity data from older and young adults were collected for 800 medically related terms. Familiarity ratings were highly correlated between the two age groups. Older adults’ transcription accuracy for sentences with medical terminology that vary in their familiarity and frequency was assessed across four listening conditions: hospital noise, speech-shaped noise, amplitude-modulated speech-shaped noise, and quiet. Listeners were less accurate in noise conditions than in a quiet condition and were more impacted by hospital noise than either speech-shaped noise. Sentences with low-familiarity and low-frequency medical words combined with hospital noise were particularly detrimental for older adults compared to younger adults. The results impact our theoretical understanding of speech perception in noise and highlight real-world consequences of older adults’ difficulties with speech-in-noise and specifically noise containing competing, non-speech information.

Firing across populations of neurons in many regions of the mammalian brain maintains a temporal memory, a neural timeline of the recent past. Behavioral results demonstrate that people can both remember the past and anticipate the future over an analogous internal timeline. This paper presents a mathematical framework for building this timeline of the future. We assume that the input to the system is a time series of symbols—sparse tokenized representations of the present—in continuous time. The goal is to record pairwise temporal relationships between symbols over a wide range of time scales. We assume that the brain has access to a temporal memory in the form of the real Laplace transform. Hebbian associations with a diversity of synaptic time scales are formed between the past timeline and the present symbol. The associative memory stores the convolution between the past and the present. Knowing the temporal relationship between the past and the present allows one to infer relationships between the present and the future. With appropriate normalization, this Hebbian associative matrix can store a Laplace successor representation and a Laplace predecessor representation from which measures of temporal contingency can be evaluated. The diversity of synaptic time constants allows for the learning of non-stationary statistics as well as joint statistics between triplets of symbols. This framework synthesizes a number of recent neuroscientific findings including results from dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic forebrain.

Leadership research has been developed to apply to different context but never explored service episodes and a customer’s leading power. In this study, a new concept, customer leadership, was developed to capture customers' behavioral impact on service encounters through interactions with service providers. We collected first-hand qualitative data in the form of field notes by observing 377 service encounters at a hair salon in Japan, and we coded 30 items of leadership-related customer behavior. The qualitative study was followed by a questionnaire survey of 773 hair salon customers, and the purpose was to build a validated new construct supported by the survey data. Results showed that the construct of customer leadership consists of three factors, delegation, guidance, and relationship-building, and 11 items. Additionally, our hypothesis on the significant effects of customer leadership on service quality and customer satisfaction was partly supported. Both studies jointly contribute to bridging the literature on leadership with service marketing, providing a new leadership construct and specific perspective of applying leadership theories to service studies. The application of this construct measure can also serve as a management tool for customer relationships.

In this article, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziomterie (ZPS), it will be underlined that one of the most effective roles is that of a Present and Embodied Coach. Explaining role theory as ‘putting on the most appropriate clothes to suit the occasion’ has emerged as a simple way to explain that clients not only have agency around the roles they play in their lives, they also can have greater control over encounters with others as consciousness of their own state develops. Deploying sociodramatic tools such as the Cultural Atom and Role Reversal as well as presence techniques from the world of coaching, this paper shares case studies and practical tips that serve both coach and client.

Although there is evidence that cognitive training enhances logical reasoning among the elderly, it remains unclear whether cognitive leisure activities (LA), which are inherently enjoyable and more accessible to older adults than cognitive training, can also improve their reasoning performance. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of cognitive LA on reasoning performance among the elderly and further explored the potential mechanism underlying this relationship. 107 elder participants from the community university for the elderly were randomized into two intervention groups (mahjong groupN= 34, chess groupsN= 33) and the control group (N= 40). Subjects in the intervention groups received activity sessions three times a week for 6 weeks, while those in the control group received regular physical and mental health care sessions. Need for cognition (NFC) was evaluated using the NFC scale before the study and then after intervention administration. Additionally, all participants were tasked to completing a syllogistic reasoning task after the intervention to evaluating their reasoning performances. Results showed that the intervention groups performed better than the control group in the syllogistic reasoning task. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the scores of NFC between the intervention groups and control group in the pretest, while the scores of NFC of the intervention groups were significantly higher than those of the control group in the posttest. Mediation analysis revealed that NFC mediated the effect of cognitive LA on reasoning performances among the elderly. We concluded that participating in cognitive LA represent a potential avenue for enhancing reasoning performances among older adults by boosting their cognitive motivation.

Religious mass gatherings are well explored in psychology, however, much research focuses on Hindu and Islamic traditions. The present study investigated how participation in theTraslaciónof the Black Nazarene,a religious mass gathering, mediated the relationship between religious identity and well-being among Catholic devotees in the Philippines. First, we predicted that religious identity influences the participation of devotees in theTraslación—a religious mass gathering in the Philippines in honor of the Black Nazarene. Second, we predicted that by attending theTraslación, participants' collective effervescence and hope would increase. A survey questionnaire was administered among devotees who participated in theTraslación(N= 331). Results indicate that religious identity was associated with participation in the religious mass gathering, which in turn increased the participants' collective effervescence and hope. Moreover, the findings highlight the importance of religious identity in predicting indicators of well-being outcomes via religious mass gatherings. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

Analog behavior observations are an important component of an evidence-based approach to assessing parent–child interactions. One threat to the external validity of these observations is reactivity and its purported influence on parent and child behaviors. The effects of reactivity on caregiver-child observations are relatively unknown, and to date, there are no known published attempts to document reactivity using a parent report measure. We examined the psychometrics of the Observation Reactivity Questionnaire (ORQ), a 29-item parent report measure of reactivity, operationalized here as a composite including parent report for whether a clinic-based observation represents home behavior (perceived unrepresentativeness), whether a clinic-based observation represents typical parent and child behavior (perceived unrepresentative parent and child behavior), perceived difficulty of the observation task, and perceived discomfort with the observation task. A community sample of 55 parent–child dyads (parents aged 23–56, children aged 2–10) completed a manualized, analog behavior observation prior to completing the ORQ. We investigated psychometric properties of the ORQ quantitative items and compiled qualitative data wherein parents described their reasoning for their responses. Internal consistency of the ORQ was adequate, although discriminative validity evidence was mixed. On average, parents were significantly more likely to report higher levels of reactivity in themselves compared to their children. We concluded that the ORQ shows promise as a new measure of reactivity during observations of parent–child interactions. By quantifying and accounting for reactivity during analog behavior observations, researchers and clinicians can decrease external validity threat concerns in the contexts of research and parent training interventions.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most prevalent nutrient deficiency in the world, with a growing literature documenting the negative effects of ID on perception, attention, and memory. Animal models of ID suggest that dysregulation of dopamine is responsible for the deficits in memory. However, evidence that ID affects dopamine in humans is extremely limited. We report the results of a study involving college-aged women with and without ID learning two different category structures – a rule-based and an information-integration structure – selected based on the putative differential role of dopamine in learning these two structures. ID non-anemic (IDNA) and iron-sufficient (IS) women completed 1200 learning trials for each structure. EEG was collected to assess the effects of ID on features affected by dopaminergic state: error-related negativity (ERN) and positivity (Pe), feedback-related negativity (FRN), and task-related blink rate. In addition, we examined the EEG data for dynamics distinguishing IDNA from IS women, including a measure of neural efficiency. Both groups of women were able to learn both structures. However, IDNA women were initially slower and less accurate than IS women, specifically for the rule-based structure. There were large and persistent group differences in brain dynamics and neural efficiency measures. The results are discussed with respect to the selective impact of ID on initial rule-based learning and the persistent effect of ID on dopamine signaling and energetic efficiency.

Stroop-like interference effects are smaller in blocks of mostly incongruent (MI) trials than in blocks of mostly congruent (MC) trials. It is unclear, though, how control processes trigger this list-wide proportion congruency effect (LWPCE). The attentional shift account posits that a memory of experiencing conflict more frequently in MI blocks than in MC blocks leads control processes to shift attention toward the target in MI blocks. The response modulation account posits that a memory of block-wide congruency statistics (e.g., mostly incongruent) leads control processes to form expectations about upcoming trial congruency independent of conflict and modulate distractor-related response activation to prepare an expected congruent response (in MC blocks) or incongruent response (in MI blocks) to the target. This modulation occurs, however, only if the system translates the distractor into a response before the target. We conducted two experiments with the prime-probe task (N= 120) to investigate the response modulation account’s prediction that giving the distractor a “head start” in stimulus–response translation increases the LWPCE independent of conflict. Confirming this prediction, the LWPCE was larger when the distractor appeared before – versus simultaneously with – the target, even though the overall congruency (i.e., conflict) effect was equivalent in these conditions (Experiment 1) or smaller when the distractor appeared before the target (Experiment 2). We also observed a negative congruency effect in the MI blocks of Experiment 2, which is inconsistent with a shift of attention toward the target. We conclude that a modulation of response activation contributes to the LWPCE.

BackgroundEven though robust evidence suggests the high prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) in China, EDs in China are characterized by low diagnosis rates, delayed treatment-seeking, and ineffective treatments. Given that listening to patients’ perspectives and lived experiences is crucial to improving our understanding of EDs in the Chinese context, an investigation of the perceived causes of EDs in Chinese individuals with EDs represents a key step in improving the prevention and treatment of EDs in China.AimsTo explore the perceived causes of EDs based on data from a sample of Chinese social media users with self-reported EDs, with a particular focus on the Zhihu platform.MethodsWe extracted and analyzed data through content analysis. Eight specific causes that could be classified into two groups were coded, including individual factors (e.g., “body image and eating”) and sociocultural factors (e.g., “media and cultural ideals”).ResultsA total of 2079 entries regarding self-reported EDs were retained for content analysis (14.7% were anorexia nervosa, 37.6% were bulimia nervosa, and 47.7% were binge-eating disorder). More than 90% of users with self-reported EDs claimed causes belonging to individual factors, while 35–51% of users claimed sociocultural factors. “Body image and eating” (68–87%) and “psychological and emotional problems” (65–67%) were the most commonly claimed specific causes, while “traumatic life events” (13–14%), “genetics and biology” (7–13%), and “sports and health” (9–12%) were the least claimed. Chi-square independent tests showed that users with different self-reported EDs disproportionately claimed certain causes.ConclusionsUsing large-scale social media data, findings provide a deeper understanding of the perceived causes of EDs in the Chinese context from individuals with self-reported EDs and highlight the variations in perceived causes across different self-reported ED types.

This research investigates how despotic leadership influences follower creativity within the hospitality context. Grounded in social exchange theory (SET), the research delves into the mediating role of psychological safety in the link between despotic leadership and follower creativity. Additionally, it explores how power distance moderates this relationship, potentially alleviating the adverse implications of despotic leadership. By analyzing data collected from 447 employees in China, our findings reveal that despotic leadership behaviors diminish follower creativity. The results emphasize the crucial role of psychological safety as a mediating factor in this relationship. Furthermore, the study uses moderated path analysis to reveal that high power distance intensifies the negative impact of despotic leadership on psychological safety, further reducing employees’ creativity. The research concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for both theoretical and practical applications.

The social media platform Instagram popularises a “healthy eating” movement, but some of its trends may be harmful. We assessed the risk of viewing #cleaneating and #whatieatinaday content on eating behaviours using adapted items from a short version of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and body satisfaction using the Body Image States Scale (BISS). A total of 403 women aged 18–78 years recruited through snowball and opportunity sampling were randomised into three study groups: #cleaneating (n= 140), #whatieatinaday (n= 141) and #nature (n= 122) as control. Participants completed online EDE-Q (lower score indicated more disordered eating behaviour) and BISS scales before and after viewing the content of their assigned hashtag. Post-exposure EDE-Q or BISS scores below pre-exposure (baseline) scores were defined as deficit scores. Logistic regression, adjusted for age and BMI, and presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), was used to compare deficit scores between study groups. The overall baseline mean (SD) age was 26.7 years (11.7), BMI 23.3 kg/m2(3.6), EDE-Q 2.7 (1.0) and BISS scores 5.6 (0.8), which were similar between study groups. Compared to control (#nature), EDE-Q scores were reduced after exposure to #cleaneating and #whatieatinaday (ANOVA:P< 0.001), and there was an increased risk for having deficit EDE-Q scores after exposure to #cleaneating: OR = 2.86 (95% CI = 1.68–4.90), and to #whatieatinaday: OR = 2.58 (95% CI = 1.52–4.39). The corresponding ORs were higher in younger age (18–21 years) but similar in different BMI categories. Exposure to #cleaneating or #whatieatinaday did not change BISS scores. A single exposure to #cleaneating and #whatieatinaday content on Instagram may encourage disordered eating behaviours, especially in younger women. Future research should examine the effects of this type of diet advice media on all genders, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic, educational and marital status, as well as LGBTQ + identity, over the longer term and after exposure to video-based content.

People with branched attractions may experience sexual and romantic attractions to different genders; for example, they may be sexually attracted to one gender and romantically attracted to another gender. Because branched attractions may violate folk theories about sexuality, we expected individuals with these attractions to face unique stereotypes. Across three preregistered experiments (totalN= 1041), and using predominantly White, non-Latiné, and straight samples, we asked if White (Studies 1 and 2) and East Asian (Study 3) targets with branched attractions are seen as: (1) confused, dishonest, and non-monogamous (bi stereotypes), (2) uncertain about and in denial of their sexuality (instability stereotypes), and (3) desired as sexual objects (fetishized), compared to targets with aligned (same-gender, other-gender, bisexual) attractions. We also assessed warmth toward targets, and explored perceivers’ need for cognition as a moderator. As expected, White and East Asian women and men with branched attractions faced heightened bi and instability stereotypes, whereas findings with warmth, fetishization, and need for cognition were mixed. Discussion considers the implications of these findings for sexually and racially minoritized individuals.

Understanding the neurocognitive mechanisms that govern the coordination of habitual and goal-directed behaviors is important, because impaired coordination will cause various behavioral disorders. However, inducing habitual responses in human beings through repetitive stimuli-response training in a laboratory setting is a challenge. Well-trained sports athletes, who have automatic perception–action associations toward expertise-related stimuli, provide a natural sample to address this critical knowledge gap. We recorded electroencephalograms (EEG) of well-trained sports athletes while they performed a Simon task with expertise-related stimuli. By manipulating the congruency between the location of expertise-related stimuli and the response hand, we dissociated automatic habitual response and goal-directed inhibition control. We observed a stronger behavioral congruency effect on expertise-related stimuli than neutral stimuli in sports athletes but not healthy controls. Furthermore, sports athletes exhibited larger response-locked lateralized readiness potentials and stronger frontocentral beta band (15–25 Hz) activity in the congruent condition than the incongruent condition, which indicate an enhanced response tendency toward expertise-related stimuli. In contrast, prominent mid-frontal theta (3–7 Hz) activity observed in the incongruent condition signaled the involvement of response inhibition. Additionally, lateralized readiness potentials amplitude and theta power showed significant correlation with performance efficiency. Taken together, these results suggest that sports athletes exhibit an enhanced coordination for expertise-related stimuli, involving automatic response preparation and proficient response inhibition through extensive training.

Since the learning and developmental processes of adults have rarely been studied in the context of coparenting, this study seeks to deepen our understanding of early coparenting development by examining longitudinal qualitative multimethod data. The data of Finnish 30 opposite-sex two-parent families were collected during three different phases: the third trimester of pregnancy with individual interviews, 4–6 months postnatal by a survey and diary method, and 18 months postnatal through individual interviews. The longitudinal analysis combined initial cross-sectional thematic analysis and longitudinal analysis. The results showed that early coparenting develops among new parental couples through the merging of simultaneous individual and interrelational processes. Early coparenting involves several adult learning processes and turning points. Four developmental pathways illustrating the couples’ journeys were identified: (a) equal and supportive coparenting, (b) from differential adaptation to smooth coparenting, (c) from the mother’s primacy to a communicating team, and (d) a challenging coparenting rollercoaster. These pathways vary from a smooth and linear growth curve to a variable and tense process that takes time and patience. In all, the results indicate that first-time parents (either as couples or partners) can be at different points in adapting to a new life stage and growing into parenthood, which may complicate the development of coparenting.

Mobbing is characterized by systematic offensive and reprehensible behaviors perpetrated by one or more individuals toward an individual worker and often has a negative impact on both the victim and the organization. There is a paucity of research examining this issue at a regional level (rural areas) in Portugal; therefore, this study aims to characterize mobbing in a sample of Portuguese workers and explore its relationships with sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, having children, length of service, rotational shift, extra training, level of education, leadership role, and activity sector). A total of455 workers (57.4% female) from São Miguel island (Azores) participated in this study, with ages between 18 and 71 years old (M= 37.8,SD= 12.4). A sociodemographic questionnaire and the Portuguese Mobbing Scale (Vaz-Serra et al., 2005) were used. Results revealed that 19.1% of the sample was a victim of mobbing at least once a week. The higher percentages of mobbing in São Miguel island were found for the following dimensions: demands that affect health (8%), life situation offenses (6.9%) and professional quality offenses (3.4%). The male gender, younger age (i.e., 18-37), not having children, lower length of service (i.e., 1-11), rotational shift were associated with higher levels of mobbing victimization. There were no differences regarding extra training, level of education, leadership role, nor activity sector. These results highlight that some demographic groups are at increased risk for mobbing victimization. Thus, organizational leaders and psychologists that work in these contexts should pay particular attention to these groups and promote a positive work environment, including healthy relationships and job satisfaction.

ObjectivesMuslims represent a significant portion of the global population, and there is an increasing interest in mindfulness within this community. Many Muslims are adopting mindfulness practices to enhance their spiritual and emotional well-being. In response to Wang's "Christian Mindfulness and Global Public Health: A Commentary and Agenda," this study aimed to examine the concept of Islamic mindfulness, its integration within Muslim practices, and its implications for public health outcomes among Muslims.MethodsThis study explored the historical and religious foundations of mindfulness in the Islamic tradition, as well as contemporary psychological perspectives on its practice. The integration of mindfulness with Muslim theistic and cultural frameworks was analyzed, with particular attention to specific forms of mindfulness embedded in daily Islamic rituals and practices.ResultsMindfulness has been a core element of Islamic spirituality for centuries, deeply rooted in Islamic teachings. It serves as a tool for fostering inner peace and tranquility, aligning with principles of present-moment awareness and non-judgmental acceptance of thoughts and emotions. These practices are evident in various aspects of daily life, such as prayer, reflection, and other devotional acts.ConclusionsThe findings of this study highlight the potential of Islamic mindfulness as a means to promote public health and enhance overall well-being among Muslims. By integrating mindfulness practices into everyday life, individuals may achieve improved mental health outcomes and greater emotional resilience, underscoring its relevance as a public health intervention.

The sudden shift to emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic left higher education institutions unprepared to address the diverse needs of international students. While much of the existing research has broadly identified the challenges international students faced, there has been limited focus on in-depth exploration of the impacts on their well-being and stress-coping, particularly for those studying remotely from their home countries. This qualitative study examines the emergency remote learning experiences of fifteen Chinese international doctoral students enrolled in U.S. institutions while living in China during the pandemic. Drawing on semi-structured interviews and social media posts, the study explores the impact of various stressors from cross-border learning contexts on students’ physical, emotional, social, and academic well-being. In response to these challenges, Chinese international doctoral students developed a range of coping strategies, from self-regulation to seeking social-emotional support. However, many also engaged in negative coping due to inadequate support from institutions and instructors. This study contributes to a deeper theoretical understanding of how contextual factors, particularly social and geopolitical influences, shape the learning experiences and stress-coping mechanisms of international doctoral students in remote settings. Additionally, it provides practical recommendations for higher education institutions to incorporate a more humanizing and empathetic approach in future remote learning programs and emergency responses.

The daily report card (DRC) is a commonly used behavioral intervention in which teachers rate child performance on target goals and parents provide home rewards based on the child’s performance. The current study investigated associations between child externalizing problems, empathy, and specific components of the DRC: (1) types of DRC goals that are chosen, (2) teacher and parent adherence to the DRC, and (3) child performance on the DRC. These aims were examined in a sample of 71 children (ages 7–11) who were enrolled in a school-home intervention designed for children with significant inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors. Teachers and parents completed separate baseline measures of inattention (IA), hyperactivity/impulsivity (H/I), conduct problems (CP), and empathy. Outcomes included type of DRC goals (i.e., academic, behavioral, and social-emotional), teacher and parent adherence to the DRC during the initial four-week intervention period, and child DRC performance during the same period. First, IA predicted more academic goals but fewer social-emotional goals, H/I predicted fewer academic goals but more behavioral goals, and CP predicted more social-emotional goals. Second, H/I predicted better parental adherence such that parents rewarded their child’s DRC more frequently. Third, baseline empathy predicted better overall DRC performance; externalizing problems did not negatively impact DRC performance. Results suggest that the DRC is a robust behavioral modification tool that can be tailored to fit each child’s needs and severity of externalizing problems. Empathy may serve as an important factor when designing treatment protocols to improve overall child behavior.

Sexual well-being has long been an area of societal exclusion for disabled people. This exclusion includes control over bodies and relationships, access to representations and public spaces, and autonomy regarding identity choices, lifestyles, and experiences. Innovative and anti-ableist approaches are needed to support sexual well-being among young disabled people. This phenomenological study aimed to explore how social workers can support journeys to achieve sexual well-being from the perspectives of young disabled people. A total of 24 semi-structured interviews were carried out with individuals between the ages of 17 and 24 in Ontario, Canada, who identify themselves as disabled and have had prior interactions with a social worker. The participants had a range of disabilities, including developmental, physical, and mental health. The majority of participants reported having more than one disability. Participants reflected on practice approaches they appreciated when social workers supported them with areas related sexual well-being. More so, they envisioned and recommended various aspects to improve the care and support from social workers. Their suggestions for social workers included increased time and space to develop a therapeutic relationship, unlearning ableism and practicing sex-positivity, accounting for the diverse lived experiences of disabled people, increasing disability representation in social work, and providing and brokering accessible and holistic practice approaches services. This study highlights the importance of holistic and comprehensive social work practice, including sex-positive approaches and multidisciplinary care.

This study aimed to test the psychometric properties of the revised Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of Personality Questionnaire (RST-PQ) using factor analyses, as well as relationships with well-established factors of personality – including the mediating role of personality traits between Fight-Flight- Freeze system (FFFS), Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS), and Behavioral Approach System (BAS) subscales. The study recruited 1,813 Libyan participants across three subsamples, ranging in age from 18 to 66, through convenience and snowball sampling methods via online platforms. In three different subsamples, findings revealed a robust RST-PQ six-factor structure, distinguishing FFFS and BIS, alongside four distinct BAS subscales. Discriminant validity was assessed, indicting Moderate/strong correlations between BIS and Negative Emotionality, and BAS subscales and Extraversion. Moreover, associations with psychological symptoms highlighted BIS’s correlation with anxiety, depression, and stress, and correlations between BAS subscales and personality traits supported their construct validity. Fit indices for the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were χ² = 30,944, df = 1,378, χ²/df = 22.01, CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.92, and RMSEA = 0.04, indicating an acceptable model fit. Gender differences showed females scoring higher in FFFS, BIS, Reward Reactivity, Impulsivity, and Panic responses. Furthermore, structural equation model revealed that personality traits mediated associations between FFFS and BIS, with BAS subscales showing differential predictive patterns. Additionally, separate scales of Defensive Fight and Panic were validated. This research provides the first validation of the RST-PQ in Arabic and highlights the mediating role of personality traits between FFFS, BIS and BAS subscales. Future studies should focus on cultural comparisons and further investigate the predictive validity of RST-PQ scales across different domains (e.g., clinical and occupational).

Recovery is a critical factor in athletic performance, and accelerating this process is essential to enable athletes to perform more effectively in both training load and competitive performance. After exercise, immediate recovery is potentially helpful for investigating autonomic activity levels, as they are definable with heart rate variability (HRV). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of ten sessions of HRV-Biofeedback (HRV-BF) training on recovery process parameters after the aerobic performance. In this study, twenty-four soccer players aged 18–24 volunteered to participate. The athletes who met the research criteria were divided into an experimental group (n= 12) and a control group (n= 12). Each participant’s height, weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and aerobic capacity were measured before and after the 10-session intervention. The experimental group participated in a 10-session HRV-BF training and soccer training program, while the control group only participated in a 10-session soccer training program. Aerobic capacity tests were then applied again to experimental and control group participants. The effect of biofeedback on the three HRV parameters during the 5-minute acute recovery period after the test was investigated. The results showed that regularly applied HRV-BF training can significantly shorten the HRV recovery parameter after exercise. Specifically, the athletes who performed HRV-BF training demonstrated faster cardiovascular recovery after aerobic exercise. This suggests that implementing HRV-BF training for athletes can significantly accelerate their recovery processes during and after competitions. Given recent technological advancements, it is promising to consider adding HRV-BF training to stress management interventions, particularly in relation to physiological stress indicators.

Recent trends in biblical scholarship that have generated new interest in the book of Psalms and in the voice of lamentation may in turn present new opportunities for the liturgical use of psalms of lament. Drawing on the SIFT approach to biblical hermeneutics, the present study tested the ways in which feeling types and thinking types may evaluate Psalm 74 differently. The data demonstrated that feeling types and thinking types approach a psalm of lament in quite different ways. For thinking types, this is a satisfying intellectual exercise. They are caught up by the theological questions raised and fascinated by the capacity of the human mind to challenge God to keep God’s side of the covenantal agreement with the people. For feeling types, this is a journey of the heart as they identify with the protagonists rehearsing the source and cause of their pain. Preachers and liturgists need to be aware of this contrast.

The assessment of color vision is crucial in both fundamental visual research and clinical diagnosis. However, existing tools for color vision assessment are limited by various factors. This study introduces a novel, efficient method for color vision assessment, which is based on a continuous motion tracking task and a Kalman filter model. The effectiveness of this new method was evaluated by assessing the color vision of both color-deficient observers and normal controls. The results from both a small sample (N= 29, Experiment1) and a large sample (N= 171, Experiment2) showed that color-deficient observers could be perfectly identified within 20 s using the tracking performance. We also compared the new method with a traditional psychophysical detection task to examine the consistency of perceptual noise estimation between the two methods, and the results showed a moderate correlation (Pearson'sr= .59 ~ .64). The results also demonstrated that the new method could measure individuals’ contrast response functions of both red–green and blue–yellow colors (e.g., the L–M and S–(L + M) axes in DKL color space) in just a few minutes, showing much higher efficiency than traditional methods. All the findings from this study indicate that the continuous motion tracking method is a promising tool for both rapid screening of color vision deficiencies and fundamental research on color vision.

Accurate eye tracking is crucial for gaze-dependent research, but calibrating eye trackers in subjects who cannot follow instructions, such as human infants and nonhuman primates, presents a challenge. Traditional calibration methods rely on verbal instructions, which are ineffective for these populations. To address this, researchers often use attention-grabbing stimuli in known locations; however, existing software for video-based calibration is often proprietary and inflexible. We introduce an extension to the open-source toolbox Titta—a software package integrating desktop Tobii eye trackers with PsychToolbox experiments—to facilitate custom video-based calibration. This toolbox extension offers a flexible platform for attracting attention, calibrating using flexible point selection, and validating the calibration. The toolbox has been refined through extensive use with chimpanzees, baboons, and macaques, demonstrating its effectiveness across species. Our adaptive calibration and validation procedures provide a standardized method for achieving more accurate gaze tracking, enhancing gaze accuracy across diverse species.

Quigley and colleagues (2024, Behavior Analysis in Practice,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40617-024-01001-4) described a treatment recommendation scenario within a multidisciplinary team setting for an adult with a developmental disability. The authors presented the information in a standard format to share how the involved parties identified, evaluated, and responded to the recommendation based upon their understanding of ethical decision-making. The core ethical principles mandated by behavioral ethics were described precisely, with the required recommendation crystal clear and unwavering. The recipient of such advise would know exactly what to think and how to react to such a treatment recommendation should they be in a similar situation in their respective clinical setting.

In all phases of life, people face decisions with important consequences. Weighing options involves using cognitive resources to assess valence, delay, and risk to achieve a desired outcome. Value-based decision-making changes over the lifespan, but studies disagree on the extent, domains, and mechanisms of this change. We assessed delay discounting, risk aversion for probabilistic gains, risk seeking for probabilistic losses, loss aversion as well as cognitive abilities, and processing noise in 86 young (25–38 years) and 93 older (63–76 years) adults. We tested whether decision-making differed between age groups and whether differences were mediated by cognitive abilities or processing noise as measured by reaction time variability and decision inconsistency. Older adults showed steeper delay discounting (p= .003) and trended towards more risk aversion for gains (p= .071). Age groups did not differ in risk seeking for losses or loss aversion. Lower decision consistency and better spatial working memory mediated older adults’ steeper delay discounting. The relationship between delay discounting and age persisted when controlling for both mediators, suggesting robust age differences in delay discounting. This persistent age difference implies mechanisms beyond noise or cognitive parameters, such as changing life circumstances or limited future perspective.

Contemporary schema theories state that schema formation relies on early maladaptive experiences regarding the frustration of core emotional needs in childhood and adolescence. However, within a broad schema perspective on human emotion and cognition, it is plausible to assume that individuals may also develop adaptive schemas based on adaptive relational experiences. Despite recent studies addressing positive schemas, a clear theoretical articulation between maladaptive and adaptive core schemas is lacking. In this sense, the present paper introduces the notion of the Dialectical Core Schemas, based on empirical data. One hundred and seventy-four participants (Mage= 22.6,SD= 9.4) fulfilled self-report questionnaires in a cross-sectional design. Correlational data showed that adaptive core self and other schemas were positively correlated with wellbeing, while maladaptive core self and other schemas were negatively correlated with wellbeing and positively correlated with symptomatology. Adaptive and maladaptive core self-schemas mediated the relationship between psychological well-being and symptomatology. Results partially support theoretical claims showing that individuals may hold simultaneously adaptive and maladaptive core schemas about the self and others. Oppositional schemas may be framed in dialectical poles suggesting that schema activation may be dimensional rather than categorical. Implications regarding developmental perspectives, case conceptualization, and clinical decision-making are discussed.

BackgroundTo date, over 1.3 billion videos with the hashtag #bodyneutrality have been viewed on TikTok. Despite this, little existing literature has unpacked how body neutrality is conceptualised on TikTok. We examined how TikTok creators construct meaning and generate discourse surrounding #bodyneutrality.MethodsExtending on previous works in the body neutrality space, we conducted a hybrid content/thematic analysis of TikTok videos in three different languages (English, Spanish, and Italian). Initially, 300 videos displaying “#bodyneutrality” were identified on TikTok. The first 178 TikTok videos were analysed, following the principles of data saturation and feasibility.ResultsWe developed three themes: (1) The normalisation of diverse bodies, (2) The rejection of appearance as fundamentally important, and (3) Body neutrality is (better than) body positivity.ConclusionsIn line with conceptualisations of body neutrality in existing literature, some content emphasised the importance of devaluing physical appearance. Building on existing definitions, most creators also framed body neutrality as speaking to the fundamental humanness of owning a body and attempted to normalise various body shapes/sizes. Conversely, some content employed #bodyneutrality to promote or examine body positivity principles or to condemn appearance-based stigmatisation. Our study is one of the first to examine how body neutrality is understood and employed by people in the real world.

Although there is a link between peer victimization, emotional symptoms, and disability or chronic condition in adolescence, less is known about the role of stable, individual differences compared to developmental processes. The current study addressed this gap by examining developmental relations between peer victimization, emotional symptoms, and disability or chronic condition. Three waves of self-report panel data on Swedish adolescents at ages 13, 15, and 17 years (n= 734; 51.6% girls) were used. Data were analyzed using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models with invariance tests by sex, disability/chronic condition, and family affluence. Girls and adolescents with a disability or chronic condition showed more heterogeneity in the co-development of peer victimization and emotional symptoms, with girls being more prone than boys to developing emotional symptoms following peer victimization, and particularly in early adolescence. Girls and adolescents with a disability or chronic condition had elevated within-person levels of both peer victimization and emotional symptoms throughout adolescence. Theory and practice may need to pay additional attention to the role of sex, disability, and their intersection, as well as age, regarding the development of peer victimization and emotional symptoms.

IntroductionThe study aimed to investigate the impact of an information-based preparation program on the psychological safety of adolescents admitted to pediatric wards, emphasizing the importance of enhancing patient safety.MethodsThis quasi-experimental study was conducted among 98 adolescents admitted to pediatric wards at Namazi Hospital, managed by Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, in 2021. The participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group using an electronic randomization table. The intervention group received an information-based preparation program, while the control group followed routine care. Adolescents completed the Psychological Safety Questionnaire after admission and at discharge. Data were analyzed using SPSS (Version 22), with a significance level of 0.05.ResultsThe mean psychological safety scores before the intervention were 136.73 ± 17.30 in the control group and 141.03 ± 16.34 in the intervention group, with no significant difference between the two groups (p= 0.20). After the intervention, the mean scores were 136.65 ± 19.01 in the control group and 145.50 ± 14.05 in the intervention group. A comparison of the mean psychological safety scores showed a significant difference between the two groups after the intervention (p= 0.01).ConclusionsThe findings of this study indicate that the information-based preparation program positively affected the psychological safety of hospitalized adolescents. Therefore, it is recommended that nurses incorporate this method into therapeutic programs for hospitalized adolescents to enhance their psychological safety effectively.

IntroductionThe incidence of PCOS is notably elevated in Iran, making it crucial to examine the quality of life among these individuals. This study aimed to thoroughly evaluate the psychometric properties of the Iranian adaptations of the PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42 questionnaires. The application of these tools is significant as they could enhance further research in in communities with similar social norms concerning marriage and sexuality.MethodsThis study employed a cross-sectional design. Following the linguistic validation of the Iranian adaptation of the PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42, a panel of experts reviewed the items through an evaluation of the content validity index (CVI) and content validity ratio (CVR). Subsequently, a semi-structured interview was carried out to evaluate face validity. Consequently, discriminant validity was assessed using the known groups comparison. Convergent validity was evaluated by assessing the correlation between similar content on the PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42, SF-12 and body image questionnaire. Responsiveness was assessed by comparing two scales scoring in baseline and eight-week follow-up data of prescription contraceptive Daine-35. In addition, reliability analyses including internal consistency and test–retest analysis were carried out.ResultsThe CVR in this study for the total scale was 0.98 for two scales, indicating a satisfactory result. The CVI for the scale was found to be 0.98 and 0.99 for PCOSQoL-42 and PCOSQoL-47, respectively suggesting that it had a good content validity. Known groups comparison revealed that the two scales effectively distinguished between sub-groups of women with varying symptoms specific to PCOS, thereby supporting their discriminant validity. Additionally, convergent validity was evaluated and, as anticipated, a strong positive correlation was observed between corresponding subscales of the two instruments. The paired t-test showed significant changes in PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42 scores (p< 0.001) indicating as a responsive outcome measure to detect significant changes over time before and after treatment. Additional analyses indicated satisfactory results of PCOSQoL-42 for internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.72 to 0.78) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ranging 0.67 to 0.92;P< 0.05). regarding PCOSQoL-47, Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.80 to 0.82 and intraclass correlation coefficients (ranging 0.61 to 0.73;P< 0.05).ConclusionThe PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42 have undergone thorough testing in Iran and may be utilized as outcome measures in forthcoming studies within this demographic.

According to recent polling, many individuals perceive that universities may limit the freedom of speech of students who hold certain political views. Whereas research has shown that university members who perceive political hostility are more likely to self-censor, few studies have examined how perceived political discrimination affects students’ self-censorship. Thus, this study explored whether perceived political discrimination felt by college students predicts self-censorship in university settings. In Study 1 (N = 163), we found that students who perceived more frequent discrimination reported more self-censorship, regardless of political orientation. In Study 2 (N = 169), we found that Republican students, but not Democrat or Independent students, who believed that they were political minorities at their university were more likely to self-censor if they perceived political discrimination. These findings provide insights into the ongoing discussions about academic freedom and freedom of speech.

For many children with significant behavioral health needs, the inability to obtain funding for adequate behavioral health care through private means results in parents “voluntarily” placing their child in the state’s child welfare system. This study investigated the association between states’ use of 1915(c) Medicaid waivers for children with behavioral health needs and state rates of voluntary foster care placements. This study used data from the Children’s Bureau Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS), from 2010 to 2019. Multilevel, linear regression models with state-year fixed-effects assessed the relationship between states’ use of a 1915(c) waiver and their total new entry voluntary foster care placement rates for children with behavioral or developmental health care needs, controlling for a variety of state-level policy and demographic characteristics. States’ use of 1915(c) waivers is significantly associated with lower total voluntary placement rates, both in total (β= -1.51 [-2.82, -0.21]) and proportionally (β=-1.03 [-2.07, 0.02]). HCBS Medicaid waivers targeting children with complex behavioral health needs may reduce state rates of voluntary foster care placements.

Research has shown that parental involvement is regarded as a fundamental contributor to children’s school success but there are currently only a few measures available to assess the degree of parental involvement in children’s learning experiences. The Parent and Family Involvement in Education Survey (PFIES) was created to assess parent and family involvement in children’s educational activities and was administered in 2007 as part of the National Household Education Survey (NHES). Although the items from the PFIES were assumed to be meaningful descriptions of parent involvement in children’s educational activities, the utility of these items as a measure of parental involvement was never assessed. This study used items from the PFIES and examined them as a new measure called the Parent Involvement Survey (PIS). Specifically, the study examined the underlying factor structure, the internal consistency, and convergent validity of the emerging measure. The same population of parents were utilized for two samples (n= 315 andn= 316). The results provided support for a 29-item measure with an oblique six-factor solution. The new instrument shows promise as a parsimonious measure for assessing the level of parental involvement in young children’s learning and educational activities. With more accurate information about parental involvement, better management and intervention solutions can be created, which subsequently leads to improved child educational outcomes.

Experimenters often ask subjects to rate displays in terms of high-level visual properties, such as animacy. When do such studies measure subjects’ visual impressions, and when do they merely reflect their judgments that certain featuresshouldindicate animacy? Here we introduce the ‘Blindfold Test’ for helping to evaluate the evidence for whether an effect reflects perception or judgment. If the same effect can be obtained not only with visual displays but also by simplydescribingthose displays, then subjects’ responses may reflect higher-level reasoning rather than visual processing—and so other evidence is needed in order to support a ‘perceptual’ interpretation. We applied the Blindfold Test to three past studies in which observers made subjective reports about what they were seeing. In the first two examples, subjects rated stimuli in terms of high-level properties: animacy and physical forces. In both cases, the key findings replicated even when the visual stimuli were replaced with (mere) descriptions, and we conclude that these studies cannot by themselves license conclusions about perception. In contrast, a third example (involving motion-induced blindness) passed the test: subjects produced very different responses when given descriptions of the displays, compared to the visual stimuli themselves—providing compelling evidence that the original responses did not merely reflect such higher-level reasoning. The Blindfold Test may thus help to constrain interpretations of the mental processes underlying certain experimental results—especially for studies of properties that can be apprehended by both seeing and thinking.

Studies suggest that mid-level features could underlie object animacy perception. In the current research, we tested whether ensemble animacy perception is based on high- or mid-level features. We used five types of images of animals and inanimate objects: color, grayscale, silhouettes, texforms – unrecognizable images that preserve mid-level texture and shape information – and scrambled images. In the series of Experiments 1, we asked participants to evaluate the animacy of single images and sets of eight images using a 10-point scale. In the series of Experiments 2, participants were shown two sets of eight images and had to choose a more animate one in the two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task. We found that in both paradigms, observers could report the mean animacy of the set of texform images without direct access to information about high-level features. Thus, ensemble animacy could be extracted only based on mid-level features such as shape and texture without access to more high-level information.

Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) encounter difficulties in acquiring various language structures. Early identification and intervention are crucial to prevent negative long-term outcomes impacting the academic, social, and emotional development of children. The study aims to develop an automated method for the identification of DLD using artificial intelligence, specifically a neural network machine learning algorithm. This protocol is applied for the first time in a Cypriot Greek child population with DLD. The neural network model was trained using perceptual and production data elicited from 15 children with DLD and 15 healthy controls in the age range of 7;10–10;4. Thek-fold technique was used to cross-validate the algorithm. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve/AUC to assess its ability to make accurate predictions on a set of unseen data. The results demonstrated high classification values for all metrics, indicating the high accuracy of the neural model in classifying children with DLD. Furthermore, a variable importance analysis revealed that the language production skills of children had a more significant impact on the performance of the model compared to perception skills. Machine learning paradigms provide effective discrimination between children with DLD and those with TD, with the potential to enhance clinical assessment and facilitate earlier and more efficient detection of the disorder.

CBT-i Coach is a free, publicly available mobile health application (app) that provides users with the core intervention components of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i). By making these components directly accessible to users, CBT-i Coach potentially circumvents barriers to accessing CBT-i, such as a scarcity of and lack of referral to trained providers. It may also serve a preventative function by helping address sleep disruption before it reaches clinical levels. However, no study to date has investigated the potential effectiveness of CBT-i Coach for either of these two purposes in public, naturalistic use. This study observed public CBT-i Coach use over an 18-month period to investigate whether users reporting either clinical or subclinical insomnia symptoms (N= 1618) showed improvement in insomnia symptoms, sleep efficiency, and sleep quality while using the app and whether clinically meaningful engagement with the app was associated with improvements. Users’ insomnia symptoms, sleep efficiency, and sleep quality improved while using CBT-i Coach (d= 0.57, 0.41, and 0.24, respectively). Regarding clinically meaningful engagement, greater engagement with the My Sleep (b= − 0.004) and Tools (b= − 0.050) sections were associated with lower final insomnia symptoms, and greater engagement with the My Sleep section (b= 0.012) was associated with higher final sleep quality. CBT-i Coach therefore appears to be a valuable public health tool to improve sleep. It may also provide a preventative service by addressing sleep disruption among those with subclinical symptom levels who otherwise might not have access to CBT-i.

Self-compassion is an individual’s ability to exercise mindfulness and self-kindness toward their own suffering, and it has been well-established as a protective factor for psychological well-being. Parents’ self-compassion may be especially important for emotion-related parenting practices, as parents’ own emotions may impact how they respond to their children’s emotions. Parent emotion socialization has implications for youth emotion regulation and psychosocial adjustment. The present study examined the effects of parent self-compassion on parent emotion socialization and its indirect effect on adolescent emotion dysregulation, using the PROCESS macro. Adolescents (n= 141;M= 14.56 years; 65% cisgender male) and their parents completed questionnaires via the Qualtrics platform in the United States. Parent self-compassion directly related to less unsupportive emotion socialization responses and adolescent emotion dysregulation, but it was unrelated to supportive emotion socialization. Parent self-compassion indirectly related to lower adolescent emotion dysregulation through unsupportive parent emotion socialization, but not supportive parent emotion socialization. Parents’ self-compassion mitigated unsupportive emotion socialization behaviors in a manner that corresponded to less adolescent emotion dysregulation. These findings represent an important addition to existing theoretical models of parent characteristics relevant for parent emotion socialization. Bolstering parent self-compassion is a possible avenue to support adaptive emotion-related parenting practices and adolescent psychosocial adjustment.

The zero-COVID-19 policy was proven to be effective in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 but has had significant impacts on people’s emotions, time perspectives, and decision-making. The current study performed five rounds of data collection (N= 1095) to investigate the time perspectives, emotions, and wisdom experiences of individuals under the zero-COVID-19 policy implementation. Hierarchical linear modeling and generalized linear hypothesis testing revealed that a balanced time perspective is the most powerful time perspective predictor of wisdom and that emotional diversity is the most powerful emotional predictor of wisdom. Moreover, emotional diversity exhibits distinct boundary effects. More precisely, among emotional indicators, “non-pessimism” is the most reliable predictor of wisdom. The moderation effect analysis showed that heightened emotional diversity amplifies the beneficial effect of a balanced time perspective on wisdom. All these effects are consistent across the zero-COVID period. This finding suggests that maintaining a balanced time perspective during a major public crisis might contribute to wise decision-making.

IntroductionDuring the summer of 2022, monkeypox (mpox) became a public health emergency primarily affecting members of sexual and gender minority (SGM) communities. Understanding how SGM social media users perceived mpox could inform community-based public health prevention strategies for future disease outbreaks. However, social media platform selection could substantially affect the insights drawn about mpox.MethodsThe present study used topic modeling and tested differences in psycholinguistic attributes using 8,605 mpox-related Reddit posts and 1,819 mpox-related tweets collected from 01 May 2022 to 13 October 2022.ResultsResults showed substantial differences in mpox communication themes between the two groups. The SGM-specific Reddit sample primarily discussed concerns with how mpox predominately affects gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, desires to find and share information about mpox vaccination, and motives to understand how mpox spreads among the community. The non-SGM-specific Twitter sample primarily discussed news reports about mpox cases provided by U.S. agencies, mpox from an international perspective, and concerns about mpox in the context of COVID-19. Group differences in psycholinguistic attributes were also evident.ConclusionsOur findings underscore the importance of community-centered public health surveillance because mpox communication differed significantly between SGM-specific Reddit communities vs. non-SGM-specific Twitter users. Public health surveillance using social media must account for these communication differences, as conclusions about a population’s reaction to disease can differ substantially based on the platform surveyed.Policy ImplicationsPublic health officials can use these findings to design community- and platform-tailored prevention messaging for future outbreaks of mpox and other infectious diseases.

BackgroundPsychotherapeutic competencies encompass a variety of skills that influence the work and therapeutic success of psychotherapists. In particular, interpersonal skills and the associated ability to react appropriately in complex therapy situations have already shown significant correlations with later therapeutic success. Strengthening interpersonal skills should therefore be a central aim of psychotherapy training. However, previous studies have shown that not only content learning is decisive for later learning success and skill development, but also the didactic method has a significant effect. Deliberate Practice and Structured Feedback have shown to be promising didactic tools. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Deliberate Practice and Structured Feedback as well as their combination in the context of psychotherapy training in comparison to classic didactic training. The trainees’ learning progress of interpersonal skills and its influence on subsequent outpatient therapies will be examined. Secondary, the study aims to identify further determinants of trainees’ therapeutic skills and to investigate the effects of ruptures on the course of therapy.MethodsThe underlying study, a randomized-control-trial with three intervention groups (Deliberate Practice, Structured Feedback, combination of both) and an active control group, will be conducted on a sample ofN= 240 trainees and their patients (N= 1000). All trainees will each attend three consecutive workshops on “Strengthening therapeutic skills in challenging therapy situations”, which will be carried out using the corresponding didactic tool. Scientific assessments will take place online for the trainees (pre, in-between, post, follow-up) and for the patients (after each therapy session for 24 weeks, follow-up). Primary outcomes will be constituted by the trainees’ Facilitative Interpersonal Skills and the patients’ symptoms. Multilevel as well as structural equation modelling will be used to analyze the data.DiscussionThe study investigates the efficacy of different didactic tools regarding the strengthening of trainee’s interpersonal competencies as well as their effects on subsequent therapies. Results of this study address a research gap concerning the improvement of psychotherapy training as well as the quality assurance of future therapies.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trial Register (DRKS) – DRKS00034279; retrospectively registered.

Psychological flexibility provides the ability to react upon and adapt to challenges across the lifespan, including thoughts, feelings or events, in a way that is consistent with personal values, thereby enhancing or sustaining wellbeing. The aim of this study is to improve our understanding of age-graded differences in psychological flexibility, by examining the relationship between (subcomponents of) psychological flexibility and age in a Dutch general population sample (N = 1770; Mage (SD) = 55.77 (14.31); 36.3% men and 63.7% women). The results show that the relationship between age and psychological flexibility was not significant when accounting for demographical variables, positive and negative affect. However, there was a significant relationship between age and five of the six subcomponents. Demographic variables (education, marital status, employment), as well as positive and negative affect, played a significant role, underscoring the importance of incorporating affective factors in future research on psychological flexibility. Additionally, the results have implication for future research, particularly in assessing interindividual trajectories through sequential longitudinal designs, and practical implication, especially valuable in our modern society with current challenges.

ObjectiveGrandparental care has become a common phenomenon, yet there is still limited research on the long-term psychological effects on children raised by their grandparents. This study aims to explore the impact of early grandparental care experiences on university students’ social networking sites addiction, social anxiety, and loneliness.MethodsA random cluster sampling method was employed to select college students from a medical school in Jiangxi for a questionnaire survey. The study measured social networking sites addiction, social anxiety, and loneliness using the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS), Interaction Anxiety Scale (IAS), and Loneliness Scale (ULS-6) respectively. Additionally, grandparental care was assessed through individual questions. Data analysis was conducted using mediated effects modeling.ResultsIn total, 4318 participants were recruited. 45.2% of participants were male and 54.8% were female. The study found a significant positive association between grandparental care experience and social networking sites addiction, social anxiety, and loneliness. The study revealed that social anxiety mediated 20.0% of the effect between grandparental care experiences and social networking sites addiction, while loneliness mediated 16.0% of this effect. Moreover, social anxiety and loneliness together mediated 12.0% of the chained effects between grandparental care experiences and social networking sites addiction.ConclusionGrandparental care has no direct impact on social networking sites addiction in adulthood. Social anxiety and loneliness play a mediating role between grandparental care and social networking sites addiction. Therefore, schools and families should prioritize efforts to enhance the physical and mental well-being of individuals receiving grandparental care. This can be achieved through targeted health promotion initiatives.

BackgroundThe Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess cognitive flexibility. Despite its widespread use, its psychometric properties have yet to be evaluated in the Italian context. Furthermore, while cognitive flexibility has emerged as a central correlate in Feeding and Eating Disorders, only a limited number of studies have investigated its association with Orthorexia Nervosa (ON), a clinical condition characterized by a pathological fixation with healthy eating. The present study aimed to fill these two knowledge gaps.MethodsA total of 803 participants (Mage= 33.89, SD = 9.44; 68.6% females) were enrolled in the investigation. The sample was randomly split into two subsamples: the first one for examining the psychometric properties of the CFS, and the second one for evaluating its association with ON symptoms. Participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing the constructs under investigation.ResultsConfirmatory factor analysis revealed a global dimension of cognitive flexibility, alongside a method factor accounting for covariance arising by reverse-worded items. The CFS, which was factorially invariant across genders, yielded a reliable total score (ω = 0.834) and provided evidence of convergent and criterion-related validity. Importantly, structural equation modelling showed that cognitive flexibility was negatively associated with emotional distress resulting from violations of orthorexic dietary rules (β = -0.279,p< .001).ConclusionsThe CFS demonstrated to be a psychometrically robust instrument in the Italian context. Moreover, cognitive flexibility may be an important treatment target for mitigating the distress derived from ON symptoms, informing the development of future therapeutic approaches.

In several ways, 2018 represents a global pivot point in research and care related to the intersection of gender diversity and autism, reflected by the increase in the number of studies on the intersection and broadening of topics. We conducted a scoping review of the literature published between September 2018 and January 2024 to summarize recent research in the field. We compared and contrasted research trends post September 2018 to research that was summarized in previous scoping reviews (Nordahl-Hansen et al. in J Autism Develop Disord 49:1745–1748, 2019; Øien et al. J Autism Develop Disord 48(12):4028–4037, 2018.https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-018-3843-z). We also summarized systematic reviews and meta-analyses published after 2018. Compared to previous reviews, we included more comprehensive search terms to focus on gender diversity broadly, rather than just gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder, and we included more detailed coding categories to uniquely identify shifts and continuities in research priorities over time. A total of 99 empirical research studies were published after August 2018 (the end of the search in the previous review) and through January 2024 on autism, gender diversity, and related topics were reviewed. There has been growth in the quantity and quality of studies on the intersection of autism and gender diversity, although methodological improvements are still needed and described in the current review. Future research should include more collaborations with stakeholders to set research priorities that are reflective of the communities being described.

The current study evaluated the effectiveness of relational training on the establishment of three deictic framing repertoires (I/You, Now/Then, Here/There) in an eight-year-old autistic boy using a multiple baseline across behaviors design. Relational training was effective in establishing all three directly trained and mutually entailed deictic relations, while differences were observed in transformation of stimulus function. Results support previous findings with the systematic development of multiple types of perspective taking repertoires with the same participant.

IntroductionIdentifying factors that contribute to the development of suicidal ideation (SI) is crucial for prevention and treatment. Perfectionistic Concerns (PC) represent the experience of external pressure to be perfect and have been consistently linked to SI, but it is unclear how PC and SI are associated in depressed adults. This study examined the association between PC and SI and whether self-esteem, loneliness and rumination (brooding, reflection and depression-related rumination) moderated this association in a clinical sample.MethodsThis cross-sectional study used a psychiatric outpatient sample of depressed adults, selected for the presence of SI. In total 110 adults (mean age 33.54 (SD= 12.03) and 60% female) participated in this study. Associations were estimated by regression analyses.ResultsPC was not associated with SI in the sample (r= .16,p= .087). However, high levels of PC in combination with low self-esteem (β = -.29,p= .007) or with high levels of depression-related rumination (β = .22,p= .017) were positively associated with SI. Loneliness, brooding and reflection did not moderate the PC-SI relationship.DiscussionThese findings underline the importance of taking into account the individual characteristics in depressed, perfectionistic individuals when estimating SI severity and selecting the focus of intervention. Due to the cross-sectional design no causal inferences can be made.

BackgroundHomework adherence (HWA) plays a crucial role in predicting psychotherapy outcomes. However, there is limited research on factors that impact homework adherence. This study employs a social cognitive framework to examine client variables and predictors impacting homework adherence among individuals undergoing individual psychotherapy.MethodUsing a cross-sectional design, 94 adults (aged 18–60 years) seeking treatment from an outpatient clinical services unit at a mental health center, were recruited. Participants completed the Short Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SSRQ), Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE), Barriers to CBT Homework Completion Scale, and Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC). Therapists rated Homework Compliance Scale (HCS). Correlations between self-regulation, self-efficacy, perceived barriers, locus of control, and homework adherence were examined. Median regression (MR) analysis was utilized to identify predictors of homework adherence.ResultsHomework adherence was positively correlated with both self-efficacy (p< 0.01) and self-regulation (p< 0.05). There was no significant relationship between the subscales of the locus of control measure and homework adherence. Patient-related perceived barriers and overall barriers were significantly negatively correlated with HWA (p< 0.01). Patient-related and therapy/task-related perceived barriers to HWA were negatively correlated with self-efficacy (p< 0.01) and self-regulation ((p< 0.01). Self-efficacy was a significant predictor of homework adherence.ConclusionsSocial cognitive factors linked to homework adherence are often overlooked in psychotherapy research. Our findings highlight the role of addressing self-efficacy beliefs and self-regulation and addressing perceived barriers to improve homework adherence and engagement, and thereby treatment outcomes.

The existence of a significant relationship between irrational beliefs and various mood disorders has been proved by previous research within the literature on irrational beliefs. However, there are a limited number of studies on the relationship between irrational beliefs and positive variables of positive psychology and mental health. This study examines the mediation of optimism and self-esteem in the relationship between irrational beliefs, specifically demandingness beliefs, and subjective well-being in adolescents. The study group comprises 235 students, including 137 female (58.3%) and 98 male students (41.7%). They were between 14-19-year-old (M = 16.14, SD = 1.10). The Irrational Beliefs Scale for Adolescents, The Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Adolescents, The Life Orientation Test, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and The Personal Information Form were used to collect data. The data were analyzed through Pearson correlation analysis, mediation analysis with Ordinary Least Squares regression, and Bootstrap. The findings reveal that optimism and self-esteem mediate the relationship between demandingness beliefs and subjective well-being. Among the mediators, optimism has a stronger mediation effect on the variables than self-esteem. The findings are discussed, and suggestions are offered for further research and practitioners.

There has been a recent surge of naturalistic methodology to assess complex topics in psychology and neuroscience. Such methods are lauded for their increased ecological validity, aiming to bridge a gap between highly controlled experimental design and purely observational studies. However, these measures present challenges in establishing construct validity. One domain in which this has emerged is research on theory of mind: the ability to infer others’ thoughts and emotions. Traditional measures utilize rigid methodology which suffer from ceiling effects and may fail to fully capture how individuals engage theory of mind in everyday interactions. In the present study, we validate and test a novel approach utilizing a naturalistic task to assess theory of mind. Participants watched a mockumentary-style show while using a joystick to provide continuous, real-time theory of mind judgments. A baseline sample’s ratings were used to establish a “ground truth” for the judgments. Ratings from separate young and older adult samples were compared against the ground truth to create similarity scores. This similarity score was compared against two independent tasks to assess construct validity: an explicit judgment performance-based paradigm, and a neuroimaging paradigm assessing response to a static measure of theory of mind. The similarity metric did not have ceiling effects and was significantly positively related to both the performance-based and neural measures. It also replicated age effects that other theory of mind measures demonstrate. Together, our multimodal approach provided convergent evidence that dynamic measures of behavior can yield robust and rigorous assessments of complex psychological processes.

Technology offers exciting possibilities for instruction with learners with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but limited research has evaluated the use of web-based applications (apps) as learning tools for this population. We wondered if using apps would function as a precurrent response to solve problems in the form of questions on a worksheet. Participants were two adolescents with ASD, Phoebe and Gavin. We taught them to use map, weather, and clock apps to answer questions about distance, temperature, and time on a worksheet (e.g., “What time is it in Cairo?”). The cities varied to ensure the answers were always unknown. Training occurred for one app at a time in the manner of a multiple baseline design across behaviors. Training steps were progressively introduced to evaluate the components necessary for app use. Gavin progressed quickly through training with the first app and then demonstrated generalization across novel questions (i.e., with different cities), apps, and response modalities (i.e., answering vocally). Phoebe required more intensive training than Gavin, and eventually demonstrated generalization across novel questions. We discuss the implications of expanding technology-based problem-solving skills by applying Skinner’s (1957;1984) analysis.

This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to provide accurate estimates of concreteness, valence, and arousal for multi-word expressions. Unlike previous artificial intelligence (AI) methods, LLMs can capture the nuanced meanings of multi-word expressions. We systematically evaluated GPT-4o's ability to predict concreteness, valence, and arousal. In Study1, GPT-4o showed strong correlations with human concreteness ratings (r = .8) for multi-word expressions. In Study2, these findings were repeated for valence and arousal ratings of individual words, matching or outperforming previous AI models. Studies3–5extended the valence and arousal analysis to multi-word expressions and showed good validity of the LLM-generated estimates for these stimuli as well. To help researchers with stimulus selection, we provide datasets with LLM-generated norms of concreteness, valence, and arousal for 126,397 English single words and 63,680 multi-word expressions.

Patient-related and therapy/task-related perceived barriers to HWA were negatively correlated with self-efficacy (p< 0.01) and self-regulation ((p< 0.01). Self-efficacy was a significant predictor of homework adherence.ConclusionsSocial cognitive factors linked to homework adherence are often overlooked in psychotherapy research. Our findings highlight the role of addressing self-efficacy beliefs and self-regulation and addressing perceived barriers to improve homework adherence and engagement, and thereby treatment outcomes.

Psychologists and neuroscientists often use complex span tasks or then-back to measure working memory capacity. At first glance, both tasks require many cognitive processes attributed to the construct, including the maintenance of information amidst interference. Nevertheless, evidence for their convergent validity is mixed. This poses consequences for the interpretation of working memory performance in cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology, applied psychology, and executive functioning research. We recruited a large and diverse sample using a multisite approach (N= 1,272; community and university participants) and had them complete multiple working memory capacity, updating, and fluid intelligence tests. We found strong evidence for a dissociation between complex span andn-back tests, and more broadly, between working memory capacity and updating factors. Observed correlations between complex span andn-back performance were modest (r̄= .25), and at the latent level, the two factors only shared 20% of their variance. Each explained unique variance in fluid intelligence, and each was more strongly related to fluid intelligence than to each other, with updating measures demonstrating stronger relations to fluid intelligence. These results were interpreted via thedisengagement hypothesis. What distinguishes updating measures from working memory capacity measures is their relative emphasis on disengagement from outdated information; disengagement drives their strong relation with fluid intelligence because problem-solving requires generating hypotheses but also discarding those discovered to be false. We suggest that researchers who want to measure and draw conclusions about working memory capacity or updating should not use complex span tasks and then-back interchangeably.

The present study introduces affective norms for a set of 880 German words rated by learners of German as a second language (L2), i.e., the Affective Norms for German as a Second Language (ANGL2). The database provides ratings across affective and subjective psycholinguistic dimensions. Besides valence and arousal ratings, ANGL2 features data on emotional prototypicality, which helps to identify emotion-label words and emotion-laden words. Moreover, the database includes two additional semantic variables: concreteness and familiarity. We observed similarities with previous studies, and the ratings provided by L2 speakers demonstrate characteristics that should be noted in studies involving bilinguals, including more moderate valence ratings, and a stronger correlation between valence and arousal, specifically for positive words. ANGL2 is the first set of affective norms that has been rated by L2 speakers for a language other than English. The set of norms is aimed to function as a resource for psycholinguistic experimental studies on the intersection between emotion and language among L2 speakers.

Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) allow for investigating the functional involvement of specific brain areas in mental arithmetic. In this study, we employed for the first time high-definition (HD)-tDCS, which offers enhanced spatial precision, to explore the functional roles of the left and right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in mental arithmetic. A total of 25 participants underwent anodal left IPS, anodal right IPS, and sham stimulation in separate sessions in counterbalanced order while solving single- and multi-step addition and subtraction problems. We found that stimulation of the left IPS, but not the right IPS or sham stimulation, improved arithmetic performance speed. These results provide further evidence for the functional involvement of the left IPS in a broad range of arithmetic tasks and highlight the potential of NIBS for cognitive enhancement.

IntroductionSyphilisis a common comorbidity among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The factors that influence the occurrence of coinfection are not yet well understood.MethodsWe investigated the prevalence of syphilis and potential risk factors among people living with HIV (PLWH) in China from January 2018 to December 2022. Patients included were newly diagnosed, older than 18 years of age, and had first started standard antiretroviral therapy for HIV. All patients completed face-to-face questionnaire surveys and laboratory tests. Pearson’s Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables and Student’s t-test was used to compare continuous variables. Logistic regression estimated the odds ratios and 95% CIs for associations between various factors and syphilis coinfection.ResultsAmong the 1391 patients with HIV, 1323 met the eligibility criteria. A total of 254 participants were coinfection with syphilis, with a prevalence of 19.20%. The prevalence of coinfection was highest in the illiterate/primary/junior high school group at 23.1% (95% confidence interval (CI),18.3–27.9%), followed by the high school group at 21.4% (95% CI, 16.4–26.4%), and the university/postgraduate group at 16.5% (95% CI, 13.9–19.2%). There was a significant difference in the number of sex partners between the HIV-infected and coinfection groups (5.8 ± 6.3 vs. 9.1 ± 11.3,p< 0.001). The prevalence of coinfection was higher in the CD4count < 200 group than in the CD4count > 400 group (p< 0.05). Anxiety scores in the coinfection group were also significantly higher than those in the non-coinfection group (p< 0.05). Logistic regression analyses found that below high school education (odds ratio (OR), 95% CI: 1.48, 1.11 ~ 1.97,p= 0.009), CD4count of less than 200 (OR, 95% CI: 1.45, 1.07 ~ 1.97,p= 0.016), five or more sexual partners (OR, 95% CI: 2.09, 1.58 ~ 2.78,p< 0.001), and anxiety (OR, 95% CI: 2.09, 1.58 ~ 2.78,p= 0.035) were more likely to exhibit coinfection.ConclusionsImproving literacy levels, reducing the number of sexual partners, raising CD4levels, and reducing stress may help reduce the occurrence of syphilis in patients with HIV.Policy ImplicationsPeople living with HIV could benefit from increasing the frequency of syphilis testing for early detection and improving health education.

In view of the neglect of previous studies on the relationship between how to provide feedback to students and how students should absorb feedback, this study constructed a multi-medium structural equation model and conducted a validation study on it. To this end, 704 senior high school students in China (45.31% male, 54.69% female, 43.47% in grade one, 28.69% in grade two, and 27.84% in grade three), were investigated by using students’ feedback literacy scale, perceived teachers’ emotion support questionnaire, critical reflection scale and cognitive reappraisal scale. The results showed that teachers’ emotion support can directly promote students’ feedback literacy, and can also indirectly promote students’ feedback literacy through cognitive reappraisal, critical reflection and their chain relationships. It is of great benefit for educators to construct and implement students’ feedback literacy intervention programs and improve feedback practice effect.

Sensation seeking is the pursuit of varied, novel, and complex experiences and has been the subject of many studies since the 1950s. Research has demonstrated sensation seeking traits are related to risk-taking, including use and abuse of substances as well as physical risk-taking such as participation in extreme sports. Researchers have developed multiple measures to assess individual differences in sensation seeking. The most used measures for adults have weaknesses, such as conflating traits with behaviors, using out-of-date language, and low internal consistency. In the present research we carried out a series of studies in which we developed and validated a brief measure of sensation. The final version of the measure contained seven adjectives that participants rated how accurately each described them. The results showed that scores on the new measure were positively related to scores on two popular measures of sensation-seeking (i.e., the SSS-V and the AISS) as well as to two measures of risk-taking (i.e., DOSPERT and YRBS).

People often encounter death-related stimuli that can remind them of their own mortality. Research shows that consumers who think about their mortality may cope with existential anxiety through various consumption behaviors. Across three studies, our work extends these findings and demonstrates that mortality salience (MS) increases people’s desire for experiential creation. The results showed that MS (versus control condition) increased consumers’ preferences for experiential creation products. This occurs because such experiential creation consumption increases consumers’ sense of personal agency, which can help them cope with MS. These findings enrich the literature on MS as well as experiential creation and provide important practical implications.

BackgroundA consistent link between self-forgiveness and well-being has been established, yet a full understanding of self-forgiveness and its correlates, particularly in relation to forgiveness by God, remains limited, especially given that most existing data are cross-sectional. This study sought to address this gap by investigating the interplay between self-forgiveness and perceived forgiveness by God in reducing stress overload among religious individuals over time.MethodsThis study involved 211 religious individuals in Canada, 55% of whom were female. Through multilevel analyses, the research examined the between-person, within-person, and cross-level effects of these forms of forgiveness on stress across three waves conducted over a total 12-month period.ResultsThe findings suggested that the effectiveness of self-forgiveness in mitigating stress may be significantly influenced by the perception of forgiveness by God, with the greatest stress reduction occurring when forgiveness by God was perceived at higher levels.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the potential value of incorporating spiritual dimensions into psychological approaches to stress management, offering insights into the complex relationships between different forms of forgiveness and their impact on mental health of religious individuals. Future research is encouraged to further explore these dynamics across diverse cultural and religious contexts.

The role of cultural heritage (CH) in sustainable tourism management (STM) goes beyond mere conservation; it is a dynamic process that involves actively integrating cultural richness into the tourism experience. This study, employing a quantitative research design with 447 tourists through online questionnaires, explores the intricate relationship between CH and STM, focusing on preserving identities and enhancing visitor experiences. The research introduces a novel aspect by emphasizing the favorable economic outcomes linked to destinations successfully incorporating CH into their tourism strategies. This insight is valuable for destination planners, emphasizing the economic benefits derived from CH initiatives. The key findings confirm significant and positive associations between the preservation of CH and STM, highlighting its substantial contribution to improved visitor experiences in sustainable tourism. Moreover, the study establishes a positive correlation between CH preservation and heightened visitor satisfaction in sustainable tourism. Effective STM emerges as a positive influence on the preservation of cultural identities, while destinations integrating CH into tourism strategies experience favorable economic impacts, reflected in increased tourist spending and local economic development. These findings offer valuable insights for future research, policymaking, and strategic planning in destinations seeking a harmonious balance between CH preservation and the advancement of tourism.

Currently, there is no validated German tool that captures the basic needs as outlined in Self-Determination Theory (SDT) in the organizational context. To be able to collect reliable and valid data for research and use the results of German research on SDT to derive and implement empirically grounded practical implications that foster employee well-being, performance, and companies’ growth, a validated measurement tool is a compulsory requirement. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a German version of the Work-related Basic Need Satisfaction scale. (W-BNS). We replicated the three-factor structure, as well as the reliability of the three subscales and could extensively confirm the construct- and the criterion-related validity of the original W-BNS for the German version (W-BNS-G,N= 648). Additionally, multi-group comparisons were conducted to investigate cultural measurement invariance with the Dutch and the Italian version of the W-BNS. In summary, the present study provides a tool with high reliability and validity assessing the basic needin the organizational context in German language. We address the potential comparability of German, Italian, and Dutch findings using the different versions of the W-BNS and conclude by discussing the limitations of the present study and deriving suggestions for future research.

The research aims to reveal the moderating effect of wage and promotion opportunities and the mediating effect of motivation on the effect of job insecurity experienced by employees in the gig economy, which is the equivalent of the current labor market, on job satisfaction. In addition, it aims to reveal all configurations of job satisfaction. With the survey data obtained from sample of gig workers, the structural model was first tested with PLS-SEM and then the asymmetric analysis technique was conducted with FsQCA. According to the first-stage results, there was no direct and significant relationship between job insecurity and job satisfaction in the gig economy. However, the relationship becomes significant when the moderating variables wage and promotion opportunities, and the mediating variable motivation are included in the research model. In the second phase, a total of fifty-one configurations and potential models emerged, which included relevant variables in symmetric and asymmetric contexts.

In recent years, the focus on student safety and well-being has intensified within educational settings, driven by national crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and school shootings and rates of student mental health decline. School mental health professionals (SMHPs) such as school counselors and school social workers are resources that schools can use as a protective factor against these threats to student well-being. However, role-based stressors preventing SMHPs from being appropriately integrated into the current educational environment such as high caseloads, financial insecurity, and a divisive political environment have accumulated in parallel to these events. Unfortunately there has been little systematic research on understanding factors to prevent stress, such as coworker support. Thus, this study delves into the daily tasks and stressors experienced by SMHPs, aiming to elucidate their roles, investigate patterns of daily activities linked to higher stress, and explore the moderating effects of perceived coworker support on SMHP stress levels. The study involved 36 school counselors and social workers funded under Arizona's School Safety Program who completed brief ecological momentary assessments (EMA) twice a week, reflecting on their experiences over the preceding days, for a duration of up to four weeks (n= 285 daily logs). Findings using latent class analysis reveal three distinct profiles of SMHP activities with high activity days associated with higher levels of stress. Additionally, coworker support was not significantly different between different profiles of days. Future research should include tasks outside the responsibilities of SMHPs, such as administrative tasks, to account for the growing body of research indicating these as additional SMHP stressors, as well as explore systemic factors that may contribute to these results.

In spite of the proliferation of research studies on vocabulary knowledge, investigating the relationship between self-regulation, vocabulary size, and collocational knowledge among English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners has received scant attention. The current study aimed to investigate whether vocabulary and collocation size can explain EFL learners’ self-regulated vocabulary learning. A population of 271 EFL learners from three state universities located in Iran participated in taking lexical measures (VST, Lex30, and a collocation test) and filling a questionnaire (SRCvoc). To check the relationship between self-regulated vocabulary learning, vocabulary and collocation size, standard multiple regression was conducted with SPSS. The results of standard multiple regression analysis showed that EFL learners’ vocabulary and collocation size could explain a significant portion of the variance in the score of their self-regulation in vocabulary learning. The findings also indicated that verb-noun collocation size and productive vocabulary size were significant predictors of EFL learners’ self-regulated capacity in vocabulary learning. Finally, implications and suggestions for future research are offered.

Humans share with many animal species the ability to perceive and approximately represent the number of objects in visual scenes. This ability improves throughout childhood, suggesting that learning and development play a key role in shaping our number sense. This hypothesis is further supported by computational investigations based on deep learning, which have shown that numerosity perception can spontaneously emerge in neural networks that learn the statistical structure of images with a varying number of items. However, neural network models are usually trained using synthetic datasets that might not faithfully reflect the statistical structure of natural environments, and there is also growing interest in using more ecological visual stimuli to investigate numerosity perception in humans. In this work, we exploit recent advances in computer vision algorithms to design and implement an original pipeline that can be used to estimate the distribution of numerosity and non-numerical magnitudes in large-scale datasets containing thousands of real images depicting objects in daily life situations. We show that in natural visual scenes the frequency of appearance of different numerosities follows a power law distribution. Moreover, we show that the correlational structure for numerosity and continuous magnitudes is stable across datasets and scene types (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous object sets). We suggest that considering such “ecological” pattern of covariance is important to understand the influence of non-numerical visual cues on numerosity judgements.

Frontline medical workers (FMWs) faced high stress levels in frontline clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to alleviate FMWs’ psychological stress by enhancing protection measures, which includes refining the selection process, improving protective measures for their work in frontline clinics, and determining the appropriate time for evacuation. A Chinese-language-version stress questionnaire, covering stress-related issues and sociodemographic characteristics, was administered to FMWs in Shanghai during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022, yielding 107 valid responses. The questionnaire’s reliability and validity were subsequently confirmed. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was applied to the stress-related questions, with the KMO and Bartlett’s test values of 0.886, 877.8522 (df = 120,p< 0.0001), respectively. Structure equation modeling (SEM) was used to confirm the factors and measure the relationships among the stress-related questions, factors and sociodemographic characteristics. The parameters of SEM named SOFAIDC were significant with SRMSR, RMSEA, AGFI, NFI, and PNFI being 0.0422, 0.0507, 0.9946, 0.9958, and 0.7615, respectively. Paired sample t-tests revealed the significant decrease in FMWs’ stress score of the current week and the previous week, with all t-values being negative and significant (p< 0.01). A latent growth model (LGM) named LGM30 verified the overall decreasing stress trend over the weeks, with high R-squares (> 0.80), significant positive linear and negative quadratic time parameters. Based on the trajectory analysis, a stress scorecard with an AUC of 0.856 was developed. This study found that there are four factors for FMWs’ psychological stress (anxiety about infection, exhaustion, lack of cognition for infection, and hesitant feeling), and improving targeted hospital protection could alleviate FMWs’ psychological stress through SOFAIDC, as all the total effect of factors or items from the feeling of being protected by hospital were negative. Meanwhile, although overall FMWs’ stress trend has decreased, 22.43% of FMWs have maintained or experienced a high stress trend, and the stress might increase over weeks in frontline clinics. To perfect hospital protection to alleviate FMWs’ psychological stress, the scorecard could be used to select FMWs with low-stress trends, LGM30 could be used to determine the withdrawal time (such as week 8), and targeted hospital protections could be designed based on the relationships between feeling of being protected by the hospital and factors in SOFAIDC, such as providing adequate protective equipment, improving the rationality of FMWs’ work schedules, recruiting personnel with higher education levels, and paying adequate monetary compensation.

Survivors of attempted suicide are often shamed and silenced with respect to their lived experiences, especially in certain societies where such behaviour is seen as taboo. Despite the phenomenon of suicide being recognised as deeply rooted in cultural narratives, limited qualitative work has focused on the experience from a subjective viewpoint and a phenomenological lens. Through this paper, I seek to provide a qualitative analysis of surviving a suicide attempt in the Indian context, using an autoethnographic approach to explore the emotional, psychological, and cultural aftermath of such experiences. The study addresses the lack of reflective research on suicide survivors in India, and focuses on the socio-cultural narratives, healthcare system interactions, and cultural expectations that shape survivors’ experiences and recovery. Some of the themes that emerged from the data analysed included “missing early warning signs- the shift from passive to active suicidal ideation”, “relief or despair on surviving? reactions of professionals and the hospital staff”, “ignorance of the experience of survival- the role played by social stigma”, and “desire to seek psychological first aid and barriers to the same”. These themes are academically analysed in the context of existing cultural narratives and normative practices, thus highlighting the role of social contexts in such experiences. The paper aims to shed light on an important phenomenon and experience that is often ignored, and argues that cross-cultural research is an essential aspect of fully grasping personal experiences, like this one. The study has implications for mental health practitioners in terms of better assisting survivors of attempted suicide, via taking into account their cultural realities and settings as a part of the experiential and healing process.

This contribution begins from Winnicott’s introduction of the incommunicado self in his paper on communication to suggest that interiority and the psyche come to constitute the infantile world through the earliest environment and through solitude. The capacity to be with others and to be alone originate in an earlier state where communication both makes no sense and yet contains the origin of the life source through the baby’s bodily experience of self and world. The world beyond the baby enables this through an other’s care. I link this with Bion’s position on loneliness and his recognition that people may choose to live in contact with the unsynthesized and incoherent. Encouraging the unsynthesized, the formless, and the inexpressible in our patients offers ways of being an analyst that for me is the legacy of Winnicott and Bion.

The aim of the study was to investigate the role of professional identity as a moderator in the relationship between the teachers’ collective responsibilities and the school improvement perspective. Data were collected from 922 teachers employed at primary, secondary, and high schools in Türkiye and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the potential structural linkages among professional identity, collective responsibility, and perspectives on school improvement. The results demonstrated that teachers’ collective responsibility was associated with their perceptions of the school improvement and components that need to be improved. The study determined the significant role of collective responsibility on teachers’ school improvement perceptions and the significant moderator role of teacher professional identity in the relationship. Focusing on testing the relationship among collective responsibility, perspectives of school improvement, and teachers’ professional identity, this study how countries with high differences between schools in international exams can improve the differences. School leaders should support teachers to join in board meetings of school. This can help with school improvement practices.

Self-compassion, which is effective in reducing burnout, may be important for aid workers because it could potentially weaken the connection of automatic thoughts and rumination with burnout. However, the effect of self-compassion in the association of automatic thoughts and rumination with burnout among nursing students has not been examined. Therefore, in this study, we examined the moderating effect of self-compassion in the association of automatic thoughts and rumination with burnout. In this longitudinal study, 72 second-year students attending a Japanese nursing college completed a two-wave panel survey. The data were analyzed using correlation analysis and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The results revealed a moderating effect of self-compassion in the relationship between rumination and burnout; however, the moderating effect of self-compassion in the relationship between automatic thoughts and burnout was limited. The results can contribute to the development of an intervention program that cultivates self-compassion and prevents burnout and turnover among nursing students.

Assisting children with homework can be a major stressor in Chinese parents’ lives. Drawing upon the Family Stress Model (FSM), our study examines the indirect effects of parental homework stress on children’s academic functioning, as well as the moderating effect of family socioeconomic status (SES). A pilot study is first conducted to develop and test a parental homework involvement style scale to capture the characteristics of supportive and controlling parental homework involvement in Chinese culture. In the main study, a total of 291 parent-child dyads participated in our survey. The results showed that parental homework stress is linked to negative aspects of children’s academic functioning through the chain mediation of lower levels of coparental support and supportive homework involvement. Multiple group path analysis revealed that, however, in low-income families, parental homework stress undermines children’s academic functioning through both reduced supportive involvement and increased controlling involvement, whereas in high-income families, this impact is channeled solely by the chain mediation of decreased coparental support and supportive involvement. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the parental homework stress process by applying the FSM to the homework context for the first time. It also adds to the homework involvement literature in exploring the potential antecedents of homework involvement styles.

With increasing literature refuting the role of situational antecedents as reliably distinguishing the elicitation of shame, guilt and remorse, there arises a need to examine the underlying dispositional factors at play. Although personality factors like neuroticism and extraversion have often been analyzed along with positive–negative affect, other personality factors and their relation to the complex moral emotions have rarely been studied. A study was conducted on 147 participants to examine the role of big-five personality factors namely, neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience and agreeableness on the three complex moral emotions. Storyboards depicting 13 scenarios were used as stimuli for measuring shame, guilt and remorse. Results enumerate that while openness to experience has the ability to distinguish between guilt and shame, neuroticism and extraversion are significant positive predictors of guilt. Overall findings suggest the interplay of personality and moral emotions and highlights the need to study these emotions in larger and varied contexts.

Most work on indicators of vocal confidence (and social influence work more broadly) examines linear relationships between variables. However, in some domains curvilinear (i.e., accelerating or decelerating) relationships may provide greater clarity in understanding human speech patterns. We review mixed past work on vocal speed as a case study, wherein faster vocal speed has been shown both to bolster and inhibit persuasion (e.g., by impairing processing). Across six total studies (Ntotal= 3,958), we show that faster speed initially increases perceived source confidence and message processing but eventually the increase attenuates or reverses. Correspondingly, vocal speed has a decelerating relationship to participants’ processing of persuasive messages, as revealed by two main processes: argument quality effects on attitudes, and the correspondence between thought valence and attitudes. The present work highlights the potential value of high-powered examinations of curvilinear relationships in non-verbal phenomenon for which speed is likely to play a role.

The paper reports comparative results of six stigmatized groups' perceptions of marginalization, exclusion, ritualistic inclusion, and dehumanization (i.e. humiliation, atrocity, and exploitation). A total of 328 participants belonging to 6 different stigmatized groups rated their experiences on questionnaires developed to measure perceived economic condition and stigmatization experiences tapped through perceived exclusion-ritualistic inclusion, dehumanization, personal and social identity. Along with these, attribution, coping, self-esteem and health were also measured. The findings revealed that all the stigmatized groups significantly differed on various dimensions i.e. stigmatization, exclusion, ritualistic inclusion and dehumanization, self- esteem, identity, and health. The transgender and beggars are among the most stigmatized and vulnerable. The perceived economic condition of beggars, downtrodden, and transgender was the lowest compared to other groups in the study and they also reported poor psychological and physical health. It was observed that both the transgenders and beggars perceived higher levels of ritualistic inclusion; however, they also reported significantly higher experiences of dehumanization. The downtrodden group is among the most economically oppressed where the perceived poverty is the highest, they report greater atrocities, their psychological health and physical health condition is also inadequate. Other groups like the differently-abled (previously termed disabled) and widowed women perceived their economic condition as stable and also reported fewer issues of physical and psychological health in comparison to other groups. Their perceptions of exclusion were comparable to the downtrodden and differently-abled, with lowest mean values for ritualistic inclusion. With respect to the dimensions of dehumanization, the disabled, leprosy patients, and widows perceived the least humiliation, atrocity and exploitation. Individually each group presents unique variations. The study highlights the issue of stigmatization and its implications for health and well-being.

IntroductionCommunity-controlled organisations provide crucial services to support the health and wellbeing of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and gender diverse, intersex, queer and other sexual and/or gender minority (LGBTIQ +) people. A strength of such organisations and their practitioners (many of whom are LGBTIQ +) is their cultural expertise, which can help to identify, understand and address the specific needs of LGBTIQ + clients, including in relation to family violence. While much discussion about standards of care for LGBTIQ + people has focused on a need for mainstream service providers and their non-LGBTIQ + practitioners to become more “culturally competent”, less has considered how clients experience services at community-controlled organisations.MethodsIn this article, we draw on 19 semi-structured interviews with clients of family violence services at an LGBTIQ + community-controlled organisation in Melbourne, Australia, to explore their perceptions of specialist LGBTIQ + services. Eleven participants were cisgender men, six were cisgender women and two were trans or gender diverse. In terms of sexual orientation, ten self-described as gay, one homosexual, two queer, three lesbian, one bisexual, one asexual and one preferred not to say. Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns of service experience.ResultsOur research shows that participants felt that specialist services were most effective when they were informed about, affirming of and focused on the identities and specific health needs of LGBTIQ + clients. Participants had experienced what they perceived to be effective services within the context of LGBTIQ + community-controlled organisations, though felt that “mainstream” service providers were also potentially capable of providing good-quality support. A concerted effort on the part of these providers to embed culturally competent and LGBTIQ + -friendly practices into their services would help them achieve this outcome.ConclusionsSpecialist support was most visible in the context of LGBTIQ + community-controlled organisations but also possible in other health and wellbeing settings, which is promising for mainstream service providers and practitioners seeking to provide more inclusive care for LGBTIQ + people.Policy ImplicationsThe insight of clients in this research is something that can potentially contribute to further discussion about the continued work both of LGBTIQ + community-controlled organisations and mainstream services.

The immediate space surrounding the hands has often been termed the peri-hand space (PHS), and is characterized by a smaller reaction time (RT), better detection, and enhanced accuracy for stimuli presented in this space, relative to those stimuli presented beyond this space. Such behavioral changes have been explained in terms of a biased allocation of cognitive resources such as perception, attention, and memory, for the efficient processing of information presented in the PHS. However, in two experiments, the current study shows that these cognitive biases seem to have an underlying temporal basis. The first experiment requires participants to perform a temporal bisection task, whereas the second experiment requires them to perform a verbal estimation task when stimuli are presented either near the hands or relatively far. Results from both experiments give evidence for slowing down of temporal mechanisms in the PHS – reflected in the form of temporal dilation for stimuli presented in the PHS relative to those presented further away. The slowing down of time in the PHS seems crucial in giving sufficient temporal allowance for the allocation of cognitive resources to prioritize the processing of information in the PHS. The findings are in line with the early anticipatory mechanisms associated with the PHS and seem to be driven by the switch/gate mechanism, and not the pacemaker component of the attentional gate model of time perception. Thus, the current study tries to integrate the theories of time perception with the peripersonal space literature.

Inhibitory control refers to the ability to suppress a pre-potent response. Studies investigating the role of emotional information in inhibitory control have yielded conflicting results. Some studies have shown that positive emotion, compared to negative, facilitates inhibitory control, while other studies have shown opposite effects. We propose a resolution to this debate by positing that the scope of attention with which emotional information is processed could elucidate these mixed outcomes. A larger scope of attention (global scope of attention) has been linked to positive emotions, and a narrow scope of attention (local scope of attention) has been linked to negative emotions. We combined a stop-signal task with a global–local Navon task. Participants were tasked with detecting a target presented within either a global or local scope of attention (letters H, S, and T). Occasionally, they encountered a stop-signal with irrelevant angry, happy, or neutral facial expressions. Results showed that under a global scope of attention, happy facial expressions impaired inhibitory control compared to angry expressions; conversely, under a local scope of attention, happy faces facilitated inhibitory control relative to angry faces. Notably, predisposition toward a local or global attentional scope, as measured by a separate global–local disposition task, did not modulate these effects. We replicated our results in Experiment 2 using hierarchical stimuli made up of digits (6, 9, and 8) and controlling for other task-specific variables. Collectively, our findings emphasize the pivotal role of scope of attention in determining the impact of emotional information on cognitive processes, specifically inhibitory control.

While recent research has advanced our understanding of asexuality, very little effort has been devoted to examining biomarkers and possible prenatal correlates of asexuality. In response, we recruited a large international sample (N= 1634 women and men) to explore associations between sibling composition and asexual sexual orientation (n= 366) and to replicate previously reported sibship effects in individuals with a same-sex attracted orientation (n= 276) and bisexual sexual orientation (n= 267) compared to heterosexual individuals (n= 725). Our analyses used two of the most recent statistical approaches that attempt to disentangle older sibling effects from family size effects (Ablaza et al., 2022; Khovanova, 2020). We found that higher overall number of siblings (female fecundity effect) predicted higher probability of asexuality in men and having fewer older sisters and being an only-child predicted higher probability of asexuality in women. Regarding the same-sex attracted orientations, higher number of older sisters increased likelihood of being a gay man (sororal birth order effect). Having fewer older sisters was associated with bisexual sexual orientation in women and higher overall number of siblings predicted increased likelihood of bisexuality in men. We did not find a fraternal birth order effect for gay, lesbian, bisexual or asexual groups using the Ablaza et al. (2022) method but the effect was significant for gay men using the Khovanova (2020) analytic approach. These findings point to potential sibship-related contribution to development of asexuality in women and men but future studies will need to replicate these results and articulate potential underlying mechanisms.

Whether conscious awareness is critical for detecting semantic information in individual words remains debated. We hypothesize that this issue is specific to language type and that orthography serves as a mediator between semantics and conscious awareness. Using a priming-based paradigm called breaking continuous flash suppression (b-CFS) with a full factorial design, this study investigated whether orthographic similarity and semantic relatedness between the prime and target could modulate conscious access to Chinese single characters. Statistics indicated that semantic relatedness did not facilitate the character’s breakthrough from CFS unless combined with orthographic similarity, although orthographic similarity alone had an inhibitory effect. The results were discussed in light of the “unconscious binding” hypothesis and object-updating theory in visual perception as well as the unique sub-morphemic construction in psycholinguistics. Our findings demonstrate the possibility of orthography-based semantic processing occurring outside of conscious awareness and suggest that the multilevel interaction activation model may be applicable to the early recognition of Chinese characters.

In the context of the reform of the economic system and the globalization of the economy, in order to explore the effect of secure base leadership on positive followership behavior. This study constructed a conceptual model of Secure Base Leadership and Positive Followership Behaviour based on Cognitive Affective Systems Theory. The chain mediating role of organisation-based self-esteem and work dynamics and the moderating role of equity sensitivity as a moderator of the relationship between secure base leadership and organisation-based self-esteem/work dynamics were examined. In total, 2 studies were conducted: study 1 was a situational experiment with 120 MBA students, which showed that secure base leaders can positively influence organisation-based self-esteem and work dynamics. To further explore this finding, Study 2 was a three-time point questionnaire survey on 366 employees in different industries, accounting for 84.14%, and the results of Study 2 not only proved the findings of Study 1, but also demonstrated that secure base leaders significantly influence positive followership behaviours. At the same time, organisation-based self-esteem and work dynamics were found to play a mediating role between secure base leadership and positive followership behaviour. In addition, equity sensitivity negatively moderated the relationship between secure base leadership and organisation-based self-esteem/work dynamism and also negatively moderated the indirect effect of secure base leadership influencing positive following behaviour through organisation-based self-esteem/work dynamism. Based on the findings, this study presents the theoretical contributions and managerial implications of this study and provides an outlook for future research.

Quigley and colleagues (2024, Behavior Analysis in Practice,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40617-024-01001-4) described a treatment recommendation scenario within a multi-disciplinary team setting for an adult with a developmental disability. The authors presented the information in a standard format to share how the involved parties identified, evaluated, and responded to the recommendation based upon their understanding of ethical decision-making. This commentary highlights a number of important strengths that played a key  role in the successful resolution of the challenge discussed by Quigley and colleagues. It further highlights some of the reasons clients may be drawn to non-evidence-based interventions and cautions behavior analysts to approach such situations with care. Though behavior analysts should not themselves provide non-evidence-based interventions, inordinate pressure on clients to avoid such interventions may constitute a form of coercion and may undermine clients’ trust in behavior analysts.

The relationship between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and screen time (ST) has been extensively studied; but the evidence remains inconsistent, and a comprehensive quantitative synthesis of this association is lacking. This study aims to provide a robust quantitative assessment of the relationship between ASD and ST by consolidating and analyzing available evidence to offer a more precise understanding of this complex association. This systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 statement, and applied a quality assessment tool for quantitative studies to identity best available evidence. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus, covering literature published from January 1, 2006 to June 12, 2024. In total, 30 studies involving 356,666 participants met the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed a significant association between screen exposure in preschool children and the development of ASD, with a longer duration of screen exposure correlating with an increased likelihood of being diagnosed with autism. Furthermore, autistic people tend to have longer daily screen use and are at a higher risk of screen addiction compared to non-autistic individuals. These findings emphasize the importance of limiting ST for preschoolers and autistic people. However, the level of evidence supporting these conclusions is very low. Future studies should focus on controlling for confounding factors, using more objective measures, and further investigate the relationship between screen engagement styles (active or passive), screen use patterns (screen devices and content), and ASD.

Differences in the perceptions of illness between patients and caregivers are associated with negative health-related outcomes. However, little is known about the correlates of divergent perceptions of ADHD among diagnosed adolescents and their parents. This study applied the Common-Sense Model of Illness Representations (CSM) to examine how parent perceptions of ADHD, including divergent parent-adolescent perceptions, relate to coping, quality of life (QoL), and treatment adherence, among adolescents with ADHD. Participants were 63 adolescents diagnosed with ADHD (10–18 years, 79.3% male, mean age = 14.28,SD= 2.07) and their parents (78.8% mothers), recruited from clinics and support services. Self-report measures were completed by adolescents and parents in isolation from one another. Results from a series of hierarchical regressions indicated that adolescents held less pessimistic views of the disorder and believed it was less biologically based than did parents. Divergent parent-adolescent perceptions regardingtimelineandcauseswere significantly related to adolescent coping and QoL. Adolescents’ expectation of a shorter duration of ADHD was associated with reduced active coping. Their stronger attribution to insufficient efforts was associated with lower QoL. Although adolescents with a stronger belief in psychosocial causes exhibited poorer active coping and QoL, they exhibited greater active coping when their parents endorsed this belief. Taken together, these findings identify beneficial and detrimental beliefs about ADHD for both diagnosed adolescents and their parents. The results underscore the potential importance of beliefs about psychosocial causes to coping and well-being, as well as the importance of divergent parent-adolescent perceptions.

In many scientific fields, sparseness and indirectness of empirical evidence pose fundamental challenges to theory development. Theories of the evolution of human cognition provide a guiding example, where the targets of study are evolutionary processes that occurred in the ancestors of present-day humans. In many cases, the evidence is both very sparse and very indirect (e.g., archaeological findings regarding anatomical changes that might be related to the evolution of language capabilities); in other cases, the evidence is less sparse but still very indirect (e.g., data on cultural transmission in groups of contemporary humans and non-human primates). From examples of theoretical and empirical work in this domain, we distill five virtuous practices that scientists could aim to satisfy when evidence is sparse or indirect: (i) making assumptions explicit, (ii) making alternative theories explicit, (iii) pursuing computational and formal modelling, (iv) seeking external consistency with theories of related phenomena, and (v) triangulating across different forms and sources of evidence. Thus, rather than inhibiting theory development, sparseness or indirectness of evidence can catalyze it. To the extent that there are continua of sparseness and indirectness that vary across domains and that the principles identified here always apply to some degree, the solutions and advantages proposed here may generalise to other scientific domains.

Considering the urgent need to tackle mental health challenges related to forced migration, our exploratory quantitative study aimed to investigate the relationship between subjective well-being (SWB), sense of coherence (SOC), trauma and psychopathological symptoms on the mental health of African forced migrants in Niger. We also explored the association of gender, age, ethnicity, and displacement status with SWB, SOC, psychological symptoms, and psychological distress in this population. The study included 410 African forcibly displaced adults (M = 38.10, SD = ± 14.56). Participants were assessed using the WHO-5 for subjective well-being, GHQ-12 for psychological distress, SOC_3 for the sense of coherence, and IES and SCL-27 for traumatic and psychopathological symptomatology, respectively. Our findings indicated significant gender differences in GHQ-12 scores, with females scoring higher and exhibiting higher levels of anxiety, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. MANOVA revealed significant differences in age, status, and ethnicity. Younger individuals showed higher total symptomatology, while refugees had higher levels of subjective well-being and sense of coherence, but also higher levels of depression and paranoia. Different ethnicities exhibited diverse symptom profiles. Furthermore, the multiple regression analysis highlighted that subjective well-being and sense of coherence had a negative effect on mental health, whereas trauma and psychopathology had a positive effect. Additionally, anxiety and trauma were positively correlated with mental distress. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing the mental health needs of displaced populations. Targeted interventions and further research are essential to address the complex issues surrounding mental health among forced migrants. Moreover, a comprehensive approach to studying and intervening on mental health issues in this vulnerable population is strongly emphasized.

Objectives: This randomized controlled trial evaluates a single-session Mindfulness Self-Compassion (MSC) intervention for enhancing interoceptive awareness (AI) and alleviating anxiety and reducing pain in Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) patients. The study also examines the intervention’s feasibility and the mediating role of IA in improving clinical outcomes, incorporating nature visuals to address treatment accessibility and adherence. Methods/analysis: Sixty-four FMS patients were randomized into three groups: MSC with audio-only, MSC with audio and nature visuals, or a waitlist control. Validated scales measured interoceptive awareness, anxiety, and pain pre- and post-intervention. ANOVA examined primary outcomes, and mediation analysis explored interoceptive awareness as a mediator. A 7-minute intervention duration was chosen for its balance of effectiveness and feasibility, with nature visuals selected for their calming effects. Findings: Both MSC groups showed significant improvements in IA, anxiety, and pain compared to the control group, with the audio-visual group showing the strongest effects. Enhanced interoceptive awareness significantly mediated anxiety reduction but not pain relief. Nature visuals further reduced anxiety and pain compared to audio-only. Novelty/improvement: This study validates the efficacy of a single-session MSC intervention for FMS, highlighting IA as a crucial mediator of anxiety improvement. Incorporating sensory-rich visual elements enhances therapeutic effects, offering a promising approach for MSC interventions in clinical settings. Future research should explore long-term benefits and optimal dosage of this innovative intervention, addressing the need for accessible, cost-effective FMS treatments.

Integrating the theoretical framework of the Stress and Coping Theory, this study investigated the impact of cumulative family risk (CFR) on adolescent depressive symptoms, investigating perceived stress as a mediator and a growth mindset as a moderator. Conducted with 726 junior high students (51.9% girls, 13.83 ± 0.92 years), the research found that perceived stress acted as a partial mediator between CFR and depressive symptoms, with CFR still showing a significant direct effect on depressive symptoms. Additionally, results showed that the interaction between a growth mindset and CFR significantly impacts perceived stress, indicating that while a growth mindset facilitates stress management, its effectiveness is diminished in the presence of high family risks. Conversely, the interplay of perceived stress and a growth mindset was found to negatively correlate with depressive symptoms, thereby acting as a robust protective factor. These findings highlight the nuanced capacity of a growth mindset to offer limited buffering against the adverse effects of high-risk family environments and to provide a stronger defense against depressive symptoms by altering stress perception.

The increasing age diversity in the workplace resulting from accelerated population distribution aging serves as a reminder for us to focus on the occupational implications of interactions between different generations, particularly for older workers. Existing studies on intergenerational contact, a behavior commonly observed across different generations, have extensively discussed its behavioral and cognitive outcomes but are lacking in motivational discussion. To further explore its motivational potential, the current research adopts a social identity perspective and a dual-identity model to investigate the impact of intergenerational contact on the generativity motive of older workers and the corresponding mechanism, with particular attention devoted to how this impact varies under different intergenerational climates. To achieve this objective, three waves of data collection from employees aged above 45 years in Chinese workplaces were conducted, resulting in a total of 373 valid samples. The empirical evidence from our study provides support for the positive impact of intergenerational contact on the generativity motive of older workers, especially in the context of a more positive intergenerational climate. Moreover, this effect is mediated by the enhancement of their identification with older worker groups and the organization. By demonstrating this model, this research significantly contributes to the literature on intergenerational contact, the intergenerational climate, generativity, and the social identity approach.

Theoretical accounts emphasize the importance of context sensitivity in emotion regulation, yet research often neglects this. This study explored how adolescents’ use of three emotion regulation strategies—cognitive reappraisal, distraction, and rumination—interacted with stressor intensity and perceived controllability to influence daily emotions. A total of 249 adolescents participated in a daily diary study (Mage= 12.73,SDage= 0.78; 63.1% males). Adolescents reported their daily use of emotion regulation strategies, emotional states, and contextual factors. In high-intensity stress situations, reappraisal and distraction each showed associations with reductions in negative affect, whereas rumination was related to increases in negative affect. In low-intensity stress contexts, reappraisal was associated with decreases in positive affect, and no significant effects emerged for distraction or rumination. For perceived controllability, no impact on negative affect was found; however, positive affect increased in uncontrollable situations when levels of reappraisal and rumination were low. Overall, the findings underscore the importance of stressor intensity and perceived controllability, suggesting that distraction’s effectiveness is less context-dependent than reappraisal and rumination. The current study hypotheses and data analytic plan were preregistered on The Open Science Framework athttps://osf.io/dfhqx/.

Growing evidence challenges the longstanding assumption of a universal decline in relationship satisfaction for all couples by demonstrating variability in the change. However, knowledge about how differential long-term trajectories of relationship satisfaction are associated with positive individual functioning is lacking. Using dyadic latent class growth analysis, we studied long-term trajectories of relationship satisfaction ofN= 300 mixed-gender couples over 10 years and examined positive outcomes in latent subgroups. At the final assessment, partners reported on positive outcomes, specifically affect, mental health, and life satisfaction. Depending on their subgroup membership, couples systematically differed: Couples in the subgroup with high initial and relatively stable relationship satisfaction reported the most favorable outcomes—more positive affect, better mental health, and higher life satisfaction—as compared to subgroups with declining and/or lower relationship satisfaction. The findings show the importance of considering the variability in long-term relationship satisfaction trajectories and point to their relevance for positive functioning.

Because alcohol use is often involved in both consensual and non-consensual sexual encounters, college students may develop internalized guidelines for how to navigate these experiences safely. The goal of this study was to solicit advice college students would provide to their peers regarding how to navigate alcohol-involved consensual sexual behavior. College students (n= 30, 15 cisgender women, 13 cisgender men, two gender-queer ages 18–30 years) from a large mid-western university were recruited to complete a one-hour interview on alcohol and sexual decision-making. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using reflective thematic analysis. College students provided three areas of advice regarding alcohol-involved consensual sex. First, they recommended their peers make sure they and the other person is sober “enough” for sexual activity by: (1) knowing your limits with alcohol, (2) relying on your friends, and (3) evaluating how intoxicated the other person is. Second, use explicit and verbal consent and refusal communication by: (1) being clear in what you are willing (or not) to do and (2) explicitly asking your partner several times, before sex occurs. Finally, students recommended evaluating the larger context of the situation. College students offered advice centered on leveraging past experiences, relying on friends for assistance in these scenarios, and doing one’s own personal evaluation of the situation. Additionally, they underscored the importance of clear, verbal communication, along with checking in and actively listening to their sexual partners during these encounters. The cumulative guidance provided by college students yields valuable insights that can inform harm reduction prevention efforts related to alcohol use and sexual consent.

Spontaneous associative processes (e.g., mind wandering, spontaneous memory recollection) are prevalent in everyday life, yet their influence on perceptual scene memory is under debate. Given that scene perception involves extraction of contextual associations, we hypothesized that associative thought would enhance scene memory by promoting encoding of contextual associations. In an online experiment (N = 75), participants viewed scenes, and following each scene either generated chained-free associations (associative processing), or, as control, listed words that begin with a specific letter (phonological processing). Scene memory was tested after an intermediate creativity task, which is also shown to rely on associative processes. Results revealed that associative thought, regardless of its conceptual (semantic) distances between responses, enhanced scene-gist memory, but hampered memory of scene details, implying that associative thought facilitates contextual encoding. In a follow-up experiment (N = 74), we found that the effect of associative thought on scene-gist memory was mediated by scene labeling. When participants were asked to explicitly label the scene before completing an associative processing or a phonological processing task, scene-gist memory was prioritized at the expense of scene details, eliminating the memory differences between tasks. These findings imply that labeling past perceived scenes, whether explicitly or implicitly during associative thought, facilitates scene-gist memory. Lastly, in both experiments, creativity was not correlated with scene memory but was positively correlated with the semantic distances between scene-based associations, extending past findings that link creativity with the breadth of associative processes. Together, these findings highlight the likely effect of post-perceptual associative processes on higher-order cognitive functions, such as memory consolidation and creative thought.

The COVID-19 pandemic presented a great challenge for individuals around the globe, and particularly for vulnerable populations such as autistic children. This qualitative study explored the experience of autistic children (both verbal and minimally verbal) and their families during the pandemic in August-October 2020 through the lens of 18 parents recruited from an opportunistic follow-up of a randomized controlled trial. Findings revealed that the pandemic was detrimental to the mental health of most parents. School closures, disrupted routines and concerns of the virus were believed by parents to be particularly responsible for increased in their child’s behaviour that challenges and anxiety, resulting in changes in acquired skills and development of tics for some. However, other parents reported that increased one-to-one interaction with their child improved their social interaction and communication. Additionally, families felt more able to cope with the situation when supported by their partner, support services and schools. The findings highlight the challenges and benefits experienced by families with an autistic child during the pandemic. They provide valuable insights into potential areas that warrant attention when preparing for future emergencies. Enhancing our ability to respond to the needs of autistic children and their families, and establishing policies that can support their well-being should be prioritised to effectively address future challenges.

IntroductionSocial identity has been recognized as a central factor explaining participation in collective action. Previous studies have predominantly focused on collective action within sexual minority groups as a whole. However, there is a need to explore the specific experiences of bisexual individuals who face distinct challenges due to monosexism. Currently, limited research has been conducted to understand the underlying mechanism that connects bisexual identity experiences to engagement in collective action. The present study examined group consciousness at intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community levels as a mediating mechanism between various aspects of bisexual identity experiences and collective action among bisexual individuals.MethodsA total of 162 individuals who identified as bisexual completed the questionnaire on bisexual identity experiences (i.e., illegitimacy of bisexuality, anticipated binegativity, internalized binegativity, and identity affirmation), group consciousness, and collective action.ResultsThe results revealed that anticipated binegativity and internalized binegativity were associated with collective action through commitment to social justice, whereas anticipated binegativity and identity affirmation were related to collective action through community connectedness. Moreover, illegitimacy of bisexuality was linked to different identity experiences, which in turn contributed to participation in collective action through group consciousness.Conclusions and Policy ImplicationsThis study offers empirical evidence highlighting the significance of group consciousness as a fundamental process that mobilizes collective action within the bisexual community. These results have important implications for clinical, educational, and community practices aimed at fostering bisexual group consciousness and reducing stigma associated with bisexuality.

Verbal fluency is a crucial cognitive ability reflecting one’s capacity to express information verbally, and various demographic, cognitive, and environmental factors influence it. This study aims to explore the eco-cultural foundations of verbal fluency by comparing two distinct ethnic communities: the Chinese Oroqen hunters and the Han agriculturalists. The Oroqen, who engage in traditional hunting practices requiring prolonged periods of silence, may experience different verbal fluency abilities compared to the Han, who are involved in farming and more frequent verbal interactions. This research adopts a comparative approach to assess and analyze differences in both semantic and phonetic verbal fluency between these groups. Data was collected from 64 high school students through a structured questionnaire, and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 23). The findings revealed that Han participants demonstrated superior semantic verbal fluency compared to the Oroqen hunters. These results provide empirical evidence suggesting that ecological and cultural contexts, particularly the nature of economic activities and lifestyle, significantly impact verbal fluency abilities. The study highlights that traditional lifestyles and ecological conditions play a crucial role in shaping cognitive functions, particularly verbal fluency. The findings have important clinical and neuropsychological implications, emphasizing the need to consider cultural and environmental factors in cognitive assessments and interventions. The disparities in verbal fluency between the Oroqen and Han groups emphasize the role of cultural and ecological contexts in shaping cognitive performance, pointing to the importance of personalized approaches for both neuropsychological evaluations and cognitive development interventions.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a home-based dialysis. Long-term dialysis results in disturbances in body image, resulting in severe stigma among patients, and leading to a heavy psychological burden and low treatment compliance. This study investigates the level of stigma and related influencing factors among young aged 18–44 years and middle-aged 45–59 years PD patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 158 young and middle-aged PD patients who were treated in two tertiary care hospitals in Shantou, China from October 2022 to August 2023. The survey was conducted using a general information questionnaire and the Social Impact Scale (SIS), Distress Disclosure Index (DDI), and Family APGAR Index (APGAR). The stigma level of young and middle-aged PD patients was at a moderate level (56.76 ± 7.56). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that related to influencing stigma involved residency, family income, exercise, type of PD, self-disclosure, and family function, which accounted for 54% of the total variance in stigma. Healthcare personnel could be focus on the above factors by encouraging patients to engage in self-disclosure, enhancing family support to reduce their stigma, and promoting their physical and mental health.

People have an innate motivation to establish and maintain romantic relationships with others, and consumption is often utilized to construct personal image. In the current research, we explore the effect of romantic alternatives on nonsingles’ experiential and material purchases. Across six studies, the results reveal that romantic alternative triggers self-enhancement in nonsingles, which in turn affects experiential versus material purchases. Specifically, men have a stronger preference for experiential purchases, while women prefer material purchases when encountering the desire for others. The studies also test the function of experiential versus material purchases in signaling desirable partner images as part of self-enhancement and address the alternative explanation of relationship seeking. The findings recognize a subtle tactic that is resorted to cope with alternatives by consumption to achieve self-enhancement, which contributes to the literature on relationship maintenance. Furthermore, this research sheds light on purchase signals of experimental and material consumption in romantic relationship context, providing practical suggestions for marketing.

Misophonia is a disorder commonly characterized by negative emotional responses to “trigger” sounds, such as chewing or tapping. It has been linked to conditions such as hyperacusis and PTSD; however, the relationship between misophonia and musical processing remains underexplored. Under the framework that misophonia stems from altered connectivity between the auditory and limbic systems, we predicted that individuals with greater misophonic severity would also have stronger emotional responses to music. From a large initial screening study (n= 300), a subset of participants (low misophonia:n= 58, high misophonia:n= 40) were asked about several musical and nonmusical traits. Participants in the high misophonia group scored higher than those in the low misophonia group on several musical measures, including active engagement with music and emotional evocation from music. Participants in the high misophonia group also scored higher than those in the low misophonia group on hyperacusis and PTSD tendencies, replicating prior work. The present study supports the conceptualization of misophonia in terms of enhanced auditory–emotional responses to both negative (“trigger”) and positive stimuli, such as music. These findings fit within a small but growing body of research highlighting the positive emotional implications of misophonia, particularly in musical contexts.

The present study explores individual differences related to the perception of the media coverage of immigrants as biased. Building on previous research, relations with the extremity in preexisting attitudes toward immigrants and in affective ratings of non-immigrants versus immigrants are examined. Additionally, the present study extends previous work by investigating dogmatism and intellectual humility, including their potential moderating roles on the relations of extremity in attitudes and affective ratings with perceived media bias. A sample ofN= 212 (59% men) individuals from the general German population completed self-reports on their preexisting attitudes and affective ratings, as well as dogmatism and intellectual humility online. Moreover, participants rated their perception of news media coverage of immigrants as biased against their views. Results indicate that particularly more extreme negative attitudes toward immigrants and affective ratings favoring non-immigrants relative to immigrants are positively associated with perceiving the media coverage of immigrants as biased. No robust relations of dogmatism, intellectual humility, or their interactions with the extremity scores with perceived media bias were found. These findings underline the importance of negative extremity in (out) group-related attitudes and affect in perceiving the media coverage as biased. New approaches investigating media perceptions from a group-related perspective are discussed.

BackgroundThe recognition of facial expressions of emotions is an essential skill for social functioning, as it enables recognizing the possible intentions of others.Main body.Cultural context is an important aspect to consider in this skill, as it tends to modulate the recognition of facial expressions.ObjectiveTo develop and validate a set of facial expressions of basic emotions of Brazilian individuals considering the population distribution of the country according to age group, sex, and race.MethodsA procedure with three phases was created to generate basic emotions and photograph facial expressions. A total of 459 Brazilians were then asked to identify the emotions of these facial expressions. Content validity was investigated based on the analysis of specialists and the recognition of emotions by Brazilian individuals.ResultsThe final database consists of 56 high-quality color images. A good level of agreement was found for the expressions perceived by the assessors (81.6%).ConclusionThe percentage of correct recognition of each emotion and the characteristics of the models are presented so that future studies can choose the most adequate images to meet their specific needs.

Past research indicates that concepts of infinity are not fully understood. In countably infinite sets, infinity is presumed to be perceived as larger than any finite natural number. This study explored whether symbolic representations of infinity are processed as such through contrasts with Arabic and verbal written numbers. Comparisons between the infinity word and number words were responded to faster than comparisons of two number words, but not when the infinity symbol was solely compared to Arabic numbers. Moreover, infinity comparisons yielded distance-like effects, suggesting that infinity (both word and symbol) can be misconceived as a “natural number” closer to larger numbers than small ones. These findings demonstrate difficulty perceiving the physically smallest stimulus (∞) as the upper end-value and seem to reflect a limited understanding of symbolic forms of infinity among adults. They further highlight the impact of notation and numerical syntax on how we process symbolic numerical information.

This essay explores possible meanings hidden in the 1928 bronze statueSinnataggen—The Angry Boy—by the Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland. The toddler, exuding anger and frustration, is a beloved statue. What is his attraction? Why is the boy angry, and what does he seek to communicate? The essay argues there is an Angry Boy in every boy and man, an emotion prohibited by contemporary American culture and especially for men of color. Anger, a response to one’s environment, is central to feeling alive and feeling real. Through a circumscribed conversation between Vigeland,The Angry Boy, and psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott, the author argues thatThe Angry Boyrepresents core experiences of the complex male self. Contemporary boys and men have a conversation partner in Vigeland’s iconic statue.

An experimental study by Hyun and Luck suggests that object working memory, but not spatial working memory, is employed during mental rotation. In contrast, correlational research points to the relevance of spatial working memory in mental rotation. Considering these somewhat conflicting results and the fact that a small sample was acquired in the study of Hyun and Luck, a replication of their study was conducted. Additionally, potential sex effects were explored. We collected (usable) data from 213 individuals across two experiments. All participants performed a mental-rotation task alone, a working-memory task alone, and both tasks concurrently. We expected greater rotation-dependent interference between tasks when the working memory task concerned object features (Experiment1) than when it concerned spatial locations (Experiment2). In Experiment1, dual-task interference was observed in working-memory accuracy. In Experiment2, there were interference effects in both mental rotation accuracy and working-memory accuracy. However, interference did not differ between experiments. Moreover, interference was not rotation dependent in either of the experiments. Thus, we could not replicate the findings of Hyun and Luck. No sex differences were found in exploratory analyses. The general interference effects found in this study may reflect the involvement of visual working memory in the processing and decision-making stages of the mental rotation of letters. This study underscores the need for further research to fully understand the role of visual working memory in mental rotation, especially with more complex stimuli.

Experiences of childhood adversity can double the risk for depression. Although the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear, DNA methylation (DNAm) has emerged as a potential pathway to explain the link between adversity and depression. We thus investigated whether epigenome-wide DNAm statistically mediates the association between childhood adversity and adolescent depressive symptoms. Specifically, we performed epigenome-wide mediation analyses to investigate the role of blood-based DNAm (age 7 years) in linking seven types of adversity (ages 0–7 years) to depressive symptoms (age 10.6 years). Primary analyses were conducted in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children and replicated in the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study and Generation R Study. We identified 70 cytosine–guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) that mediated 10–73% of the correlation between adversity and depressive symptoms, with DNAm differences at 39 of these CpGs showing protective effects. Our findings suggest DNAm reflects a biological pathway linking childhood adversity to depression and a potential mechanism towards resilience.

BackgroundEating disorders (EDs) are serious psychiatric disorders that may cause great suffering and reduced quality of life. Severe EDs often lead to somatic complications and have a high mortality rate. The most seriously ill patients need hospitalisation, with a need for highly trained nurses.MethodsThe aim of the study was to investigate challenges when nursing adults with a severe ED, and how to succeed in establishing a therapeutic relationship. A qualitative design was chosen, and individual qualitative interviews conducted with twelve nurses. The analytic method was Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis.ResultsSix main themes were developed: entering the patient’s world of experience (with the subthemes: understanding the patient’s anxiety, understanding the patient's rigidity and need for control and understanding the patient's ambivalence), providing somatic nursing, building relationships, ‘holding the line’ (with the subtheme: demanding and rewarding), manoeuvring between rules and frameworks and providing good nursing care during coercive treatment.ConclusionNursing patients with a severe ED is demanding, requiring somatic as well as psychiatric expertise. The nurse must understand the patient's anxiety, rigidity and need for control, and ambivalence. Nursing patients with a severe ED requires clarity, and steadiness and the nurses must cope with resistance. To succeed, teamwork and support from colleagues are needed.

Research has found increased premature mortality among autistic individuals, with suicide being one of the most common causes of premature death in autistic youth. This study aimed to fill literature gaps related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) in autistic youth by exploring the clinical predictors of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicidal and/or self-injurious behavior (SSIB) in 404 autistic youth from a clinic database. Consistent with prior literature, STB were elevated in autistic youth compared to general population rates. Self-reported suicidal ideation and behaviors were increased in autistic youth assigned female at birth. Caregivers reported greater SI in older autistic youth as compared to younger youth. Logistic regression analyses showed that elevated depressive symptoms and greater cognitive rigidity significantly increased the likelihood of SI in autistic youth. Results have important implications for understanding factors that increase the risk for suicidal ideation and behaviors in autistic youth and informing the development of responsive interventions.
