Currently, there is growing literature on trauma-informed care and interventions addressing health and mental health problems from this approach. In Latin America, however, literature and intervention are scarce and there is an opportunity for social work to promote community-wide responses. This article aims to diminish this gap by contributing with a case analysis focused on Chile. For this, we present a descriptive narrative case study approach, drawing upon our previous qualitative research projects, literature, and document review with an empirical analysis based on our professional experiences as a team of Chilean social workers, psychologists, and professors with lived experience in mental health. First, we describe these traumatic events, analyze their consequences on the population’s mental health, and delve into the clinical problems associated with the traumatic events described. Then, we approach the mental health system and social work in Chile, discussing the resurgence and strengthening of the social-clinical disciplinary perspective and the gaps in the comprehensive approach to mental health. In our results, we identify opportunities for improvement in the development of trauma-informed interventions. We discuss the lack of awareness, research, and interventions that tackle collective and individual trauma in Chile, identifying the need for mental health first aid in disasters and the need for justice and reparation.
The issue of whether a salient stimulus in the visual field captures attention in a stimulus-driven manner has been debated for several decades. The attentional window account proposed to resolve this issue by claiming that a salient stimulus captures attention and interferes with target processing only when an attentional window is set wide enough to encompass both the target and the salient distractor. By contrast, when a small attentional window is serially shifted among individual stimuli to find a target, no capture is found. Research findings both support and challenge this attentional window account. However, in these studies, the attentional window size was improperly estimated, necessitating a re-evaluation of the account. Here, using a recently developed visual search paradigm, we investigated whether visual stimuli were processed in a parallel or a serial manner. We found significant attentional capture when multiple stimuli were processed in parallel within a large attentional window. By contrast, when a small window had to be serially shifted, no capture was found. We conclude that the attentional window account can be a useful framework to resolve the widespread debate regarding stimulus-driven attentional capture.
Transitioning from kindergartens to elementary schools marks a critical period for young children and children’s school readiness is a strong predictor of their future educational attainment. The purpose of this study was to examine the relations between family socioeconomic status (SES) and Chinese preschoolers’ cognitive and non-cognitive school readiness outcomes and to further explore the moderating role of parental involvement in these relations. A total of 311 five-six years old kindergarteners and their parents living in Shanghai, China participated in the study. Parents reported demographic information and their involvement in children’s education. Children’s school readiness was rated by their teachers based on daily observations. Findings of this study indicated that family SES was positively associated with children’s cognitive school readiness (i.e., communication and general knowledge and language and cognition) but not significantly related to non-cognitive school readiness (i.e., social competence and emotional maturity). Parental involvement moderated the relations between family SES and children’s cognitive and non-cognitive school readiness. In the context of low home-based parental involvement and home-school conferencing, family SES was related to children’s cognitive school readiness, while in the context of high home-based parental involvement and home-school conferencing, family SES was not associated with children’s cognitive readiness. Unexpectedly, family SES was negatively related to children’s social-emotional readiness outcomes when parents displayed high levels of home-based parental involvement. Implications for practice and suggestions for further research were also discussed.
In recent years, video marketing through livestream platforms, such as Tiktok, Kwai and Microblog etc., has become the main way of e-commerce enterprises, particularly in China. Mainly through the strong recommendation of internet celebrities or livestream influences by influencers and followers’ interaction, this marketing model enhances the consumer social presence and increases brand promotion and product sales. Livestreaming helps retailers to build mutual trust between internet influencers and fans in a virtualized internet environment, creating a close and intimate internet community, and ultimately turning fans or followers into customers or potential customers. Building upon self-determination theory and closeness theory, this study attempts to explore the underlying theoretical mechanism between the relationship of social presence and consumer stickiness. The empirical results show that in a virtual shopping environment, the stronger the consumer’s social presence, the stronger the stickiness to the shopping platform. Consumers’ trust level mediates the relationship between social presence and consumer stickiness. Closeness level affects consumer stickiness by regulating the second half of the path of the mediating role of trust level.
The Housing First model is embedded in a supportive housing federal program aimed at reducing homelessness by offering housing vouchers and case management services to chronically unhoused veterans with co-occurring disorders. Despite the successes Housing First programs have achieved with the chronic unhoused population, including veterans, the cycle of homelessness continues to exist in this subgroup. These veterans have significant vulnerabilities, such as severe mental health and addiction histories, that contribute to their housing instability. The case narrative in this paper illustrates the story of a chronically unhoused veteran who cycled through episodes of homelessness due to ongoing substance use and evictions. On the veteran's third entry into a Housing First program, the social worker utilized the transtheoretical model (TTM) to evaluate the veteran's readiness to change and applied motivational interviewing (MI) principles to find a representative payee who would support housing stability, even if the veteran experienced a relapse. This approach can be considered harm reduction in supportive housing. Through the application of MI, the veteran exercised self-efficacy, opted for implementing a protective factor, and experienced long-term stable housing.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, organisations globally shifted into an emergency mode, leading to significant changes in the labour market. In light of these developments, this study sought to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic context influenced employees' evaluations of the different states of work motivation, as outlined in the framework of the Self-Determination Theory. A sample of 243 Portuguese employees completed the Multidimensional Work Motivation Scale (MWMS) at two-time points (before and during the pandemic). Repeated‐measures univariate and multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) were used to examine differences in work motivation scores between Time 1 and Time 2, as well to analyse the interaction between time and sociodemographic and work-related variables in the same dimensions. The results showed a positive and significant effect of the COVID-19 pandemic context on the more autonomous states of work motivation, i.e., Identified Regulation and Intrinsic Motivation, and those related to the controlled states of motivation, mainly Extrinsic Material Regulation and Introjected Regulation. In addition, workers without higher education have benefited more in terms of identified regulation throughout the pandemic, suggesting that the pandemic context may have facilitated the internalisation of new values and meaning at work for this group.This two-wave study suggests that the pandemic context acts as a psychological determinant affecting how job resources contribute to fulfilling autonomous motivation. The internal factors driving employees' autonomous motivation are shaped by their perception of the job resources within the wider context. In times of crisis, it is vital to focus on work resources and psychological needs to maintain employee motivation. Organisations must adjust their strategies to offer adequate support and balance demands and resources, especially during crises such as the pandemic.
The coronavirus pandemic posed a major challenge to mental health. Existing evidence shows that COVID-19 is related to poor emotional well-being, particularly among women. However, most work on the subject uses single-country samples, limiting the ability to generalize the disparity or explain it as a function of societal variables. The present study investigates the expression of positive and negative emotions during the pandemic as a function of gender and across 24 countries (N= 49,637). Strong gender differences emerged across countries, with women reporting more negative emotions (anxious, depressed, nervous, exhausted) and less positive emotions (calm, content, relaxed, energetic) than men. The gender gap in positive emotions was significantly wider in countries higher in individualism and narrower in countries higher in power distance. For instance, differences in emotions were larger in Western countries high in individualism, such as the USA, the UK, Italy, and France, and smaller in countries with higher collectivism and power distance, such as China, Malaysia, and South Korea, with a few exceptions like Japan and Brazil. These gender differences across countries were not explained by country-level gender inequalities indicators (GGGI and GII). Interestingly, the national severity of the pandemic, an epidemiological factor, reduced gender differences in positive emotions. These results underscore the importance of considering cultural and national factors when assessing gender differences in well-being.
Team status difference (TSD) refers to the difference in the relative ranking of team members based on their levels of respect, prestige, or influence as perceived by others. Much research on TSD has focused on the functional and dysfunctional effects of TSD at the team level, but few studies have explored the paradoxical impacts of status differences on employees. This study draws on the challenge-hindrance demand model (CHM) and transactional theory of stress to explore when and how TSD is associated with employees’ productive and counterproductive behaviors through distinct job-demand appraisal mechanisms. Further, the moderating role of individual personality traits is considered. Data were collected from 1631 Chinese employees within 108 teams using a three-stage team leader-member matching survey method. Mplus 7.0 was employed for multilevel structural equation model analysis. The results revealed that TSD is positively correlated with employees’ perceived job challenge and subsequent innovative behavior, particularly for those exhibiting a cooperative personality. Conversely, for employees with a competitive personality, TSD leads to increased perceived interpersonal conflict and subsequently, higher deviant behavior, but decreased innovative behavior. This study contributes to the literature by extending our knowledge of the impact of TSD on individual employee outcomes and demonstrating how the same status differences can yield both positive and negative outcomes depending on the personality traits of the employees involved. These findings serve as a useful reference for the design of team status structures in modern firms.
This study aimed to systematically examine the relationship between emotion differentiation (ED) and depressive symptoms. Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, EBSCO, PubMed and Science Direct databases were searched from the time of build to March 25, 2023 for studies that: (i) were in English, (ii) peer-reviewed, (iii) reported correlations between PED/NED and depressive symptoms, and (iv) NED, PED, and NA were derived from emotional scores using ecological momentary assessment, daily diaries, and standardized stimuli ratings. Exclusions included duplicates, non-empirical research, studies not focused on PED/NED or depressive symptoms, conference abstracts, review articles, and studies lacking correlations between PED/NED and depressive symptoms. Review Manager 5.4 and Stata 17.0 software were used to perform meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression analysis and publication bias detection of the extracted data. A total of 16 samples with 2515 participants were included. Some evaluated studies found a negative correlation between negative emotion differentiation (NED) and depressive symptoms, while others reported positive association. No significant correlation was observed between positive emotion differentiation (PED) and depressive symptoms. Meta-analysis revealed a significantly negative association between NED and depressive symptoms (r= -0.14, 95%CI= [-0.21, -0.06],p< 0.01). However, PED was not significantly related to depressive symptoms (r= -0.02, 95%CI= [-0.07, 0.03],p= 0.41). Critically, the correlation between NED and depressive symptoms was moderated by mean negative affect (NA) (t= 3.50,p< 0.01, 95%CI= [0.297, 1.377]), whereas diagnostic status, assessment of NED, age and proportion of female did not emerge as moderators. This study confirmed the negative association between NED and depressive symptoms, in particular when experiencing more intensive negative emotions, whereas the null association between PED and depressive symptoms. In addition, the diagnostic status, assessment of NED, age and proportion of female did not affect the link. Our findings have important clinical implications for facilitating the comprehending, prevention and treatment of depression. We discuss limitations as well as suggestions for future research.
IntroductionMental health is crucial for overcoming obstacles, completing tasks, and contributing to society. Mental, social, and cognitive healths are included. In demanding fields like medicine, academic pressure can cause exhaustion, poor performance, and behavioral changes. Mental health must be addressed to improve student success and well-being. Medical students’ coping strategies, anxiety, depression, and behavioral changes in uncontrollable situations will be studied.MethodologyA cross-sectional study involved 393 medical students from various universities in Khartoum. Data was collected using an online questionnaire to assess mental health responses during both controllable and uncontrollable situations across all academic years.ResultsData analysis using SPSS 27 indicated minimal missing data (0.25%) among the 393 participants. PHQ-4 scores assessed psychological distress, anxiety, and depression. The study found that 74.2% of participants experienced behavioral, cognitive, and emotional changes. Significant associations were observed between PHQ-4 scores and these changes (p< .05) using Chi-Square testing. Most participants were females aged 20 to 22, primarily from the Medicine and Pharmacy departments. The study revealed that most individuals utilized pharmacological coping strategies following significant life changes due to uncontrollable situations.ConclusionThe study highlights that women experienced stress, dissatisfaction, concern, and anger more frequently than men during ongoing war and the post-COVID-19 lockdown. Medical students faced substantial challenges in behavior, emotions, and cognition during societal unrest, including fatigue, feelings of failure, and sleep disturbances. Over 74% reported multiple changes in their emotions and behaviors. Coping strategies included nicotine, sleeping aids, socializing, exercise, venting, meditation, and journaling.
Awareness of age-related change has been shown to outperform chronological age on a variety of outcomes. More specifically, its two dimensions, awareness of positive and negative age-related changes, have been shown to be, respectively, positively and negatively associated with work-related proactivity, and that they are better predictors than chronological age and subjective age for key types of proactivity. In this paper we construct and test a model of the mechanisms that may explain these relationships. Drawing on two aging theories, socio-emotional selectivity theory and selection, optimization and compensation theory, we hypothesize that future time perspective and goal setting mediate the relationship between awareness of age-related change and proactivity. Using data (n= 410) from a survey of Chinese teachers, the tests of the model support it in the case of two dimensions of proactivity, task and development proactivity. Awareness of age-related change does not, however predict a third dimension, organization proactivity, as having a managerial role is a more dominant factor. The study further quells doubts about older employees’ ability to contribute creatively to their roles and highlights the virtues of aging processes rather than chronological age in understanding work-related behaviors.
BackgroundEmotions are a fundamental part of life and play a critical role in shaping individuals’ experiences Effectively regulating emotions in socially appropriate ways is essential for navigating life successfully. This study investigated the impact of seven sadness regulation strategies on depression and anxiety and examined the mediating role of ER in the relationship between sadness regulation and depression and anxiety.MethodA cross-sectional design was employed with 350 participants (144 men, 206 women) aged 18 to 35.ResultsRegression analyses showed that sadness regulation strategies significantly predict both depression and anxiety. For depression, the model explained 18.6% of the variance (F(7,342) = 11.140,p< 0.001), with cognitive reappraisal, religious coping, and seeking support negatively associated, while rumination was positively associated. For anxiety, the model explained 19% of the variance (F(7,342) = 11.484,p< 0.001), with rumination and substance use linked to lower anxiety levels, while other strategies showed no significant associations. Mediation analyses highlighted emotion regulation critical role, with sadness regulation influencing depression indirectly through ER (β= -0.024, 95% CI [-0.040, -0.009]) and accounting for 3.6% of the variance. Sadness regulation also had a direct (β= -0.037,p< 0.001) and indirect effect on anxiety through emotion regulation, explaining 6.1% of the variance.ConclusionThese findings underscore the importance of adaptive sadness and emotion regulation strategies in mitigating depression and anxiety, offering valuable insights for therapeutic interventions.
The present study explores the relative importance of men’s physical attractiveness and purported intelligence to the hypothetical mate preferences and choices of 201 daughters and 187 corresponding parents. We measured self-reported mate preferences and then varied men’s physical attractiveness (more vs. less attractive) and intelligence (higher vs. lower peer intelligence rating) in a 2 × 2 independent groups design replicated across daughters and parents. Although intelligence was rated by both women and their parents as significantly more important than physical attractiveness for a long-term mate for daughters, both daughters (72.64%) and their parents (59.56%) chose the more attractive man as the best long-term partner for daughters, regardless of his purported intelligence level. Furthermore, although daughters rated a partner’s attractiveness as more important than their parents did when considering a mate for daughters, daughters’ and parents’ choices corresponded 73.8% of the time, suggesting less conflict over mate choices than may be predicted based on self-reported ideal mate preferences. However, when higher attractiveness and higher intelligence were not paired, women were more likely to choose the more attractive man while parents were more likely to choose the more intelligent man, suggesting different trade-off preferences for women and their parents. Men’s physical attractiveness may be more important to both daughters and parents than consciously realized, and daughters’ and parents’ mate choices may correspond more closely than their responses to rating scales might suggest.
In an era marked by the rise of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research, this paper embraces a multidisciplinary approach by utilizing quantum mechanics to critically examine human consciousness through the literary textThe Pregnant King(2008). The myth of Yuvaneshva, whose feminine nature is regarded as taboo, is analysed through the lens of quantum mechanical principles. Specifically, Yuvaneshva’s psyche is interpreted via the concepts of the double slit experiment, quantum entanglement, quantum actuality and potentiality, and wave-particle duality, which serve as methodologies to explore the Anima’s struggle. This study integrates Carl Jung’s theory of the collective unconscious and Roland Barthes’ theory of myth within a quantum framework to analyse the formation of meaning, leading to hyperreality and depicting the Self’s struggle within this hyperreal context. By positioning these theories within quantum logic, the paper examines the Self-Other duality (akin to wave-particle duality) and how the collective unconscious reshapes the nature of the Self through quantum principles. This approach elucidates the concept of truth in terms of quantum actuality and potentiality, scrutinizing the ambiguous nature of the Self and how socially constructed ideologies (collective unconscious) obscure personal truth through hyperreal social constructs. Furthermore, it proposes a multidisciplinary method for the study of myths, thereby bridging the traditionally perceived gap between science and literature. By adopting an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary perspective, this method fosters collaboration between science and literature, paving the way for future research and promoting various multidisciplinary approaches.
This paper examines early expositions of the idea that to think about an object is to construct and manipulate an internal model of that object. The origin of this idea is normally credited to Kenneth Craik (1943) but here I show that it is prefigured in the writings of two nineteenth century physicist-psychologists, Hermann von Helmholtz and Ernst Mach.
With increased urbanization, the need to create a child-friendly society for all has increased in urgency. Ensuring children’s right to participate in the development of child-friendly cities is a crucial part of this effort. This study used focus group interviews to explore action framework for creating a friendly social environment from the philosophical perspective of children in current Chinese social contexts. This study was conducted in three primary schools located in urban, rural and rural‒urban fringe areas. With the school’s consent, we enhanced the sample diversity by randomly selecting 6–12 third- and fourth-grade students, as well as 8–12 fifth- and sixth-grade students from each school. In total, six focus groups consisting of 53 primary school students were formed. The results indicated that a friendly family environment consists of seven dimensions: family communication; support; companionship; interaction; respect and equality; conflict and violence avoidance; and the normative behavior and positive qualities of family members. A friendly school environment was found to involve seven dimensions: teacher‒student relationships, peer relationships, a student-centered learning environment, student involvement, parental involvement in school life, the personal characteristics of adults working at the school, and children’s responsibilities. A friendly community environment was found to consist of six dimensions: neighborly relationships, community support, civil community behavior, community activities, children’s participation, and children’s sense of responsibility. The children were also guided to discuss strategies for improving friendly family, school and community social environments. This study identified children’s perspectives on friendly social environments and concrete strategies for building these environments, which can be used as important theoretical support for work practices in current Chinese culture.
BackgroundCreativity motivated by negative intentions can be referred to as malevolent creativity. While existing findings have largely focused on environmental or individual factors influencing malevolent creativity, less attention has been directed towards understanding how the sense of place—derived from individual-environment interaction—affects malevolent creativity. Additionally, the role of coping styles as mediating mechanisms in negative environments has been insufficiently explored.MethodsThis study aims to investigate the relationship between negative sense of place and malevolent creativity, while examining the mediating role of coping styles. To this end, a paper-based survey was conducted among 1310 Chinese high school students, utilizing the Negative Sense of Place Scale, Coping Styles Scale, and Malevolent Creativity Scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 and Mplus 8.3.ResultsThe findings revealed that a negative sense of place in the school environment significantly and positively predicted malevolent creativity. Negative sense of place was also positively associated with negative coping styles and negatively associated with positive coping styles. Furthermore, coping styles mediated the relationship between negative sense of place and malevolent creativity.ConclusionThis study enriches existing literature by elucidating the links between sense of place, coping styles, and malevolent creativity. These findings provide valuable insights for strategies aimed at reducing malevolent creativity and preventing harmful creative behaviors in educational contexts.
Within the framework of Moral Foundations Theory (MFT; Haidt & Graham,Social Justice Research,20(1), 98–116,2007; Haidt & Joseph,Daedalus,133(4), 55–66,2004), the aim of the present study is to adapt and discuss the psychometric features of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire 2 (MFQ-2; Atari et al.,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,2023) in the Italian context. Utilizing a sample of 947 Italian adults, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted, which confirmed the six-factor solution initially proposed for the MFQ-2. Each moral foundation demonstrated acceptable reliability, underscoring the robustness of the questionnaire’s internal consistency. Correlation analyses between the MFQ-2 and MFQ-1 dimensions indicate a significant consistency across the dimensions of both versions, affirming the convergent validity of the MFQ-2. Additionally, Multi-Group Confirmatory Analyses (MGCFAs) indicated that the MFQ-2 exhibits configural invariance across genders. Despite several limitations, this study provides precious insights into the adaptation process of the MFQ-2 for the Italian cultural context, contributing to a broader understanding of the MFT in Italy.
This study explores the influence of full-range leadership approaches (transformational, transactional, and passive avoidant) on followers’ envy and the influence of envy on organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) and work deviances (WDs). We conducted two three-wave studies involving 784 employees and 206 supervisors from diverse industries. Based on followers’ perceptions of leadership (study 1) and leaders’ rated leadership styles (study 2), the Bayesian multilevel results reveal that transactional leadership is positively associated with followers’ envy, while transformational leadership is negatively associated with envy. Passive avoidant leadership has no significant relationship with envy (study 2). Envy acts as a bridge connecting transformational and transactional leadership styles and their effects on OCBs (study 1), as well as their impact on WDs (study 2). This research enhances the understanding of how full-range leadership styles impact followers’ envy and provides a noteworthy extension to the ever-growing literature on the nexus of leadership and envy.
Children are expected to outlive and live longer than their parents. However, the traumatic death of a child challenges parents’ understanding of life and death. If parents are unable to form their own perceptions of death after such a loss, it can hinder their ability to cope and adjust. This study aims to explore parents’ perceptions of death following the traumatic death of a child. To recruit participants, an online advertisement was posted on the websites of Finnish bereavement organizations, their member mailing lists, and closed discussion groups. The study consisted of two phases. In the initial phase, 66 parents responded to open-ended questions via the LimeSurvey platform. Subsequently, 17 parents were interviewed in-depth over the phone. The findings were analyzed using thematic analysis. The perceptions of parents who had experienced the traumatic death of a child included death is universal, awakening or preparing for their own death, reunion in death, death and spiritual growth, and death is unjustified. These findings highlight the importance of providing support to parents following the traumatic death of a child, which can help them reconstruct perceptions of death and better adapt to their loss.
The COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in unprecedented challenges globally, significantly impacting mental health and wellbeing. This study examines the impact of social disconnectedness on mental health, when it is imposed as forced action to control the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, the impact of family support and religious commitment as key factors of subcontinent culture are analyzed in moderating variables on psychological distress due to social disconnectedness. The data was collected from 450 participants from Pakistan through a web-based survey using pre-validated scales and analyzed using structure equation modelling (SEM). The results of the study indicate that social disconnectedness significantly influences psychological distress. Moreover, family support and religious commitment significantly moderate the relationship between social disconnectedness and psychological distress. The social disconnectedness strategy adopted during the COVID-19 outbreak resulted in a psychological crisis. Such intervention in countries with weak economies and health systems may result in another pandemic of mental stress. The study highlights the critical need for policymakers to integrate culturally relevant support mechanisms, such as family and faith-based interventions when designing public health strategies. Incorporating such approaches can mitigate the mental health repercussions of future crises, ensuring holistic community wellbeing while combating pandemics.
Science-related populism has recently emerged alongside political populism. However, its occurrence, connections with political populist attitudes, and underlying factors have not been explored in the Central-European context. This study seeks to achieve three key objectives: (1) examine the relationships among science-related populist attitudes, their subdimensions, and political populist attitudes; (2) assess the prevalence of populist attitudes; and (3) analyze a set of explanatory and exploratory factors contributing to political and science-related populist attitudes. Drawing from a national sample of 643 Slovaks, our study highlights the importance of addressing science-related populism in parallel with political populism. It elucidates the intricate interplay between these attitudes, with political populism being more prevalent in the Slovak population, albeit intertwined with science-related populism. Several contributing factors, such as education, political orientation, religiosity, trust in science, relative deprivation, faith in intuition, and susceptibility to pseudoscientific beliefs, were identified. These factors offer valuable insights into the emergence of populist attitudes in Slovakia. The findings from this study hold significance for further research aimed at comprehending and addressing the phenomenon of science-related populism within the Central-European context.

BackgroundThe positive association of parental phubbing with internalizing and externalizing problems among adolescents has gained academic traction. However, current researches on the negative impacts of parental phubbing have focused primarily on adolescents, with a noticeable lack of studies concerning preschool children, and there is also a deficiency in investigations from the perspective of the Risky Family Model. These gaps limit our understanding of how parental phubbing affects problem behaviors among preschool children. To address this gap, the present study constructed a chain mediation model to examine the association between parental phubbing and social withdrawal in preschool children, by introducing two mediating variables—parent–child conflict and negative emotions.MethodsA sample of 739 preschool children (mean age 5.04 years,SD= 0.84) and their parents participated in the study. The parents completed measures of the Parental Phubbing Scale, Child–Parent Relationship Scale, Children’s Behavior Questionnaire, and Child Social Preference Scale. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the four scales were 0.75, 0.84, 0.74, and 0.83, respectively. All the measures showed good reliability and validity in the present study. The data were analyzed via SPSS 26.0 and SPSS PROCESS.ResultsThe results indicated that (1) parental phubbing had a significant positive effect on social withdrawal in young children; (2) parent–child conflict and negative emotions independently mediated the relationship between parental phubbing and social withdrawal in young children; and (3) parent–child conflict and negative emotions served as serial mediators in the relationship between parental phubbing and social withdrawal in young children.ConclusionsThese findings in the present study contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying the association between parental phubbing and social withdrawal and have important implications for interventions aimed at improving social withdrawal among preschool children in China. Furthermore, the present study first introduced parental phubbing into the Risky Family Model, expanding the applicability of this model.

We aimed to examine the impact of Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) on organizational performance within the context of Kenyan small and medium enterprises (SMEs). We employed a comprehensive, integrated fuzzy reasoning approach to address critical research gaps in culturally diverse, resource-limited settings. Data from 1,350 respondents and expert assessments through fuzzy weighted sum techniques provided an indepth insights into how LMX quality correlates with organizational success. Demographically, a proportion of (827)61% was ascertained for males while a value of (523)39% was determined representing females. The youngest and oldest age distributions were observed to be from 26 to 58. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) result confirm positive associations between LMX and improvements in employee well-being, job satisfaction, and organizational resilience, illustrating LMX’s role in fostering a cohesive and resilient work environment that supports team effectiveness and sustainable growth. These findings establish LMX as a vital strategic asset for bolstering employee engagement and driving competitive organizational performance. Our study advances the theoretical understanding of LMX by integrating fuzzy logic with affective engagement analysis thereby offering a practical framework for SME leaders in emerging markets to enhance employee engagement and organizational efficiency.
The purpose of this study is to examine the mediating effects of acculturative stress and loneliness on the relationship between perceived discrimination, depression, and somatization among international students from Mongolia living in South Korea. Data were collected from 288 Mongolian international students in South Korea, and 268 responses were analyzed after excluding 20 participants who were not university students or had incomplete responses.The analysis was conducted using SPSS 22.0 and AMOS 22.0 programs to evaluate the structural equation model. The results indicated that perceived discrimination had a significant direct effect on acculturative stress, depression, and somatization. However, the direct path from perceived discrimination to loneliness was not significant. Additionally, acculturative stress had a significant effect on loneliness, depression, and somatization, suggesting that higher levels of acculturative stress are associated with increased loneliness, depression, and somatization. Furthermore, loneliness had a significant negative effect on both depression and somatization. The mediated effects of loneliness and acculturation were significant, indicatingthat perceived discrimination canincrease acculturative stress, which in turn can increase loneliness, leading to depression. Finally, perceived discrimination had a significant indirect effect on somatization through acculturative stress and loneliness.
This study explored the psychological factors related to the intention to avoid childbirth among Korean adult women of childbearing age. The study verified predictive models for this intention using psychological variables and demographic profiles to provide useful information and knowledge for further studies and interventions. The participants were 400 Korean women of childbearing age, aged 18–45 years. The predictive models were verified using stepwise regression and decision tree analyses. The results revealed that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, behavioral activation system (BAS), behavioral inhibition system (BIS), stress, hardiness, life satisfaction, and expectations for the future were significantly correlated with the intention to avoid childbirth among Korean adult women of childbearing age. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that neuroticism accounted for the greatest variance in the intention to avoid childbirth. Neuroticism, life satisfaction, drive, expectations for the future, and tenacity accounted for approximately 16.5% of the variance in women’s intentions to avoid childbirth in young adulthood. The decision tree model predicting the intention to avoid childbirth included life satisfaction, extraversion, witnessing mothers’ difficulties raising children, religion, and neuroticism. These findings suggest that psychological variables such as neuroticism and life satisfaction may play a more important role in Korean young adult women’s intention to avoid childbirth.
In the realm of project management, leadership has long been a focal point of concern. However, the emergence and significance of informal leadership within the project context remain underexplored. This study, drawing on social exchange theory, hypothesizes the relationship between leader-member exchange (LMX) and the emergence of informal leadership, as well as the moderating effects of organizational complexity and ethical leadership. Using an experimental study (Study 1) and a multi-source survey (Study 2) with 198 participants from 68 project teams, this research demonstrates how informal leadership emergence acts as a mediator between LMX and project performance. Further analysis reveals that organizational complexity and ethical leadership strengthen the connection between LMX and informal leadership emergence. These findings offer a comprehensive explanation of how informal leadership emerges within project teams, identifying key conditions that facilitate it, and reveal its role and impact on project performance. By unveiling these dynamics, the study provides crucial insights into identifying and fostering informal leadership to enhance project performance.
The aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the “Body and Appearance Self-Conscious Emotions Scale (BASES)” and “Body and Fitness-Related Self-Conscious Emotions Scale (BSE-FIT)” for Turkish adolescents. Each scale consists of 16 items and four subscales (shame, guilt, authentic pride, and hubristic pride) and items are responded on 5-point Likert scale. The psychometric properties of BASES and BSE-FIT were tested on 332 girls and 264 boys, a total of 596 participants (Mage=13.88,SDage=1.92). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) with multi-group analysis (MGA) were used to test the 4-factor and 2-factor structures and measurement invariance. Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency coefficient and composite reliability (CR) were calculated for reliability. According to the model fit indices and factor loadings, the most appropriate model was the 4-factor CFA model for BASES and BSE-FIT. Cronbach’s alpha and CR coefficients were 0.79 and above in the 4-factor CFA structures of both scales. In addition, MGA demonstrated factor structures, factor loadings, intercepts, and measurement error variance of BASES and BSE-FIT were equivalent according to sex, school level, sport status, region, and body mass index. In conclusion, BASES and BSE-FIT are valid and reliable in Turkish adolescents, and both scales provided measurement invariance in adolescents with different demographic characteristics.
In today’s debate about a user oriented humanistic turn in the field of mental health care, the early Foucault is once again relevant. In his works from 1954 Foucault shows that the root of understanding mental phenomena is not to be found in universal medical concepts and methods, but in the reflection on lived experiences and in the human being itself. In accordance with contemporary social, community, and cultural psychologists, such as Brinkmann, Kinderman and Prilleltensky, Foucault is critical to the psychology’s medical foundations. Instead of focusing on medical and physiological matters he suggests that psychology, as a discipline, should be more user oriented, and focus more on the human being itself, and on social and cultural contexts.
Age-related impairments are observed in a variety of cognitive constructs, including significant deteriorations in working memory (WM) performance. To measure the WM, the commonly used task in cognitive aging is then-back. Despite its widespread use, however, its psychometric properties have not been sufficiently studied. Previous research has typically examined construct validity by correlatingn-back task measures with other WM tasks and has primarily assessed reliability through test-retest, occasionally including split-half reliability. In this study, we comprehensively examined the psychometric properties of then-back task by evaluating its construct validity across different age groups (younger and older adults) and stimulus types (verbal and non-verbal) and by assessing reliability through three methods: test-retest, split-half, and alternate forms. Our findings showed similar performance in verbal and non-verbaln-back tasks for both younger and older adults in terms of discrimination ability and reaction time. However, age-related differences favored younger adults, providing evidence for construct validity. In addition, then-back measures were stable over time, consistent for two halves, and comparable for different forms, demonstrating task. This study provides the first evidence supporting the validity of then-back task with regard to age and stimulus type, alongside its reliability. These findings have important implications for clinical research and practice, suggesting that then-back task can be confidently utilized in neuropsychological assessments.
This study used structural equation modeling analyses to ascertain the contribution of four aspects of L2 word knowledge of meaning to second language translation proficiency among 358 Chinese University students with advanced English as foreign language learners. Vocabulary knowledge was measured in four form-meaning item formats: active recall, passive recall, active recognition, and passive recognition. The translation ability test includes sentence and paragraph translation from English to Chinese and Chinese to English. The study revealed a significant correlation between the four aspects of vocabulary knowledge of meaning and L2 translation proficiency based on Pearson correlation coefficients. Furthermore, the study found that active recall is crucial in L2 translation proficiency, passive recall ranks second, then followed by active recognition and passive recognition, as per the linear multiple regression analyses of AMOS-SEM. This highlights the importance of four aspects of L2 vocabulary knowledge of meaning, especially active recall, in improving L2 translation proficiency. It suggests that learners should focus on this aspect of vocabulary knowledge to enhance their performance. The findings of this study could be valuable for educators and learners in the vocabulary learning and translation field.
This qualitative study aimed to establish aspects of humanistic therapy that young people (13–16 years old) perceived as helpful and hindering, and to test a novel method for identifying perceived processes of change. A “medium q” thematic analysis was conducted followed by a coding-based “process of change analysis.” Participants were 50 young people in London schools who experienced moderate or severe emotional symptoms and had participated in up to 10 sessions of a school-based humanistic intervention. Participants were predominantly female and ethnically heterogeneous. Therapist qualities most often perceived as helpful were affiliative in nature. Unhelpful therapist activities were silences and a lack of input. Young people described feeling free to talk and open up. Helpful outcomes included feeling unburdened, gaining insight, and improving relationships. “Getting things off their chest,” “Advice and guidance,” “Modeling relationships,” and “insights to behavior change” were identified as specific processes of change in over 50% of young people. Approximately one-third felt hindered by a lack of therapist input, silences, or not feeling able to open up or trust. These findings indicate the potential value of an active, “process guiding” stance in humanistic therapy. Our process of change analysis has potential for identifying perceived change mechanisms in therapy.

This research examines the dynamics between organizationally prescribed perfectionism (OPP), psychological safety, burnout, depression, and coaching leadership in the context of the South Korean workforce. By applying several theories, we developed a moderated mediation model. This model suggests that psychological safety and burnout act as sequential mediators between OPP and depression, while coaching leadership moderates the relationship between OPP and psychological safety. Our data, collected from 413 employees across four waves using a time-lagged design, support our proposed model. Structural equation modeling revealed that OPP directly and indirectly affects depression via psychological safety and burnout. Furthermore, the impact of OPP on psychological safety is reduced under strong coaching leadership. These findings underscore the need to address perfectionism in the workplaces and highlight the central roles of psychological safety and coaching leadership in enhancing employee resilience and well-being. This study enriches existing literature by bringing together different theoretical frameworks to provide a comprehensive understanding of how perfectionism affects employee outcomes. It also provides practical recommendations for organizations seeking to foster a supportive and thriving work environment amidst increasing demands for perfectionism.
It is well established in the literature that the relation of spatial ability and the number representation, but the intrinsic relation of spatial visualization ability and number representation are not well understood. In the Current study, Chinese Preschool children (N= 200; 107 girls; Mage = 5.47years, SD = 0.67) completed two kinds of spatial visualization tasks and six kinds of number representation tasks. The results showed that spatial visualization ability was positively correlated with number representation for 5 years-old Children. Furthermore, spatial visualization ability can positively predicted number representation. These findings are consistent with the view that spatial visualization is recognized for its potential to enhance numerical skills, encompassing competencies associated with fundamental number. Therefore, developing children’s spatial visualization ability may be an effective way to enhance their number representation skills. This has important implications for early education and intervention strategies.
Although evidence from previous studies suggests that adolescents with negative coping styles who experienced victimization are more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms, these associations have not yet been disentangled to separate between-person differences from within-person effects. To investigate the within-person bidirectional relationships among relational victimization, coping styles and depressive symptoms, this study conducted a four-wave random intercept cross-lagged panel model analysis. The final sample consisted of 1506 adolescents, 72.6% of whom were male, with a mean age of 10.90 years (SD= 1.12) at the first time point. The findings revealed a prospective within-person association between relational victimization and depressive symptoms, and a reciprocal within-person relationship between depressive symptoms and avoidance coping. The approach coping style negatively predicted depressive symptoms over time, whereas depressive symptoms did not affect the approach coping style. These findings show how depressive symptoms, relational victimization, and coping styles are related at the individual level, extending previous research through the demonstration of stable within-person associations over time.
A growing body of evidence across psychology suggests that (cognitive) effort exertion increases in proximity to a goal state. For instance, previous work has shown that participants respond more quickly, but not less accurately, when they near a goal—as indicated by a filling progress bar. Yet it remains unclearwhenover the course of a cognitively demanding task do people monitor progress information: Do they continuously monitor their goal progress over the course of a task, or attend more frequently to it as they near their goal? To answer this question, we used eye-tracking to examine trial-by-trial changes in progress monitoring as participants completed blocks of an attentionally demanding oddball task. Replicating past work, we found that participants increased cognitive effort exertion near a goal, as evinced by an increase in correct responses per second. More interestingly, we found that the rate at which participants attended to goal progress information—operationalized here as the frequency of gazes towards a progress bar—increased steeply near a goal state. In other words, participants extracted information from the progress bar at a higher rate when goals were proximal (versus distal). In exploratory analysis of tonic pupil diameter, we also found that tonic pupil size increased sharply as participants approached a goal state, mirroring the pattern of gaze. These results support the view that people attend to progress information more as they approach a goal.
This study examined how Israeli men who pay women for sex (MPWS) construct and sustain a moral identity within the social context that often portrays them as deviants, perpetrators, and abusers, thereby challenging their ability to maintain a respectful and dignified image. Twenty-three Israeli MPWS participated in in-depth semi-structured interviews, which were then analyzed using constructivist grounded theory method. Using the theoretical framework moral reflexivity, we conceptualize three central dynamics of constructing and sustaining a moral identity in the context of paying for sex: Maintaining an intact moral self by resisting the moral conflict; presenting a reflexive agonizing moral self; and constructing a moral self through identity fragmentation. The findings reveal that these facets of the moral reflexivity process can overlap, coexist, and circulate in a messy manner, thus promoting an ecological understanding of how morality is shaped by various societal forces, rather than discovering what a moral identity is. We therefore call for a morally sensitive approach in studies in the field of MPWS and sex work. Such an approach encourages researchers to be aware of moral issues, moral questions, and moral processes, and to treat morality as a socially context-dependent trait that is highly relevant to the study of the sex industry.
The purpose of this commentary is to highlight the negative impact of caregiver burden on the mental health and well-being of family members who provide informal care for their loved ones. Personal fulfilment and strengthened family bonds are among the inherent rewards of informal caregiving. However, it is associated with physical, emotional/psychological, social, and financial burdens. Caregivers mostly suffer from caregiver burdens such as stress, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compassion fatigue, burnout, depression, and suicidal ideation. Informal caregivers are pivotal in providing informal care for their families and loved ones, particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Ghana and Nigeria. Family caregivers who provide informal care are often at risk of becoming invisible victims of poor mental health outcomes. Informal caregivers lack the knowledge and skills to support themselves because they may not have been trained. In these contexts, mental illness, attending mental healthcare programmes, and providing to care individuals suffering from mental illnesses are often stigmatised and associated with shame, limiting access to professional support for both caregivers and care recipients. There is sufficient evidence that self-compassion interventions are effective in protecting the mental health of people across diverse cultures. Therefore, family caregivers will benefit from self-compassion training interventions to protect themselves and from mental health problems associated with caregiving roles.
Supporting the implementation of evidence-based interventions is a core goal of implementation science. Although prior research points to the role of technology and intervention coaches in supporting implementation in the school setting, existing models may not be feasible in many real-world school contexts, due to time and resource constraints. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the acceptability, feasibility, and utility of a novel implementation support package that leverages interactive technology and strategic resources within the existing school social network to support teachers’ use of the Daily Report Card. The Daily Report Card is an evidence-based intervention for disruptive classroom behavior. We used a multi-method single case study to understand this implementation support package in one school district in western Canada. Data for this study included social network analysis, teacher and coach surveys, a coach focus group, teacher interviews, and teacher implementation data. Results indicate that our implementation support package was viewed as acceptable, feasible, and useful by participating schools, but that some improvements are also needed. Lessons learned about leveraging peers within the social network and about the use of interactive technology to support implementation are discussed.
This study seeks to uncover the underlying belief structures that shape the cognitive processes behind the intention of unmarried women toward marriage. To achieve this, the extended theory of planned behavior was utilized as the theoretical framework. Quantitative data were collected from 480 unmarried women in China. Structural Equation Modeling was used to analyze the data. This study followed a two-phase survey procedure. In the first phase, the target population’s beliefs were elicited, and in the second phase, the relationships between those beliefs and other theories of planned behavior constructs were analyzed. The findings indicate that the theory of planned behavior model effectively elucidates the formation of marital intentions among these women. Negative and positive behavior beliefs, normative beliefs, and control beliefs serve as foundational elements for shaping marital attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Notably, marital attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control directly influence marriage intentions. This research offers insights into the factors potentially influencing the marriage perspectives of Chinese unmarried women. It emphasizes the need to refine laws and regulations to better safeguard the rights and interests of Chinese women, especially in areas like marriage, childbearing, employment, and career progression. Furthermore, the study advocates for the provision of services like marriage counseling, emotional education, and family counseling through public institutions to bolster the marriage intentions of these women.

This interdisciplinary research investigates the application of wearable-based sensor devices in identifying sexual satisfaction among individuals with disabilities, within the context of sex volunteer services. The research employs a three-step analytical approach incorporating Social Learning Theory (SLT) to examine the interplay between individual needs, organizational services, and societal developments. Methodologically, the study utilizes Factor Analysis (FA) to evaluate factor communalities, Triangular Hierarchical Entropy (THE) to assess decisive weights within the SLT framework, and Analytical Network Process (ANP) to construct an evaluative framework for identifying critical factors in developing wearable sensor technology for sexual rights access. The research yields three main. Conclusions: (1) Wearable sensor technology significantly enhances perceived volitional expressions and behavioral responses of individuals with disabilities in sex volunteer services, potentially leading to increased sexual satisfaction. (2) A complex interplay exists between various components of wearable-based sensor devices and the Neural-Sensory Stimulation System (NSSS), highlighting the sophisticated nature of these technological interventions in enhancing sexual experiences. (3) Wearable sensor components interact complexly with various aspects of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), underscoring their potential in advancing the rights and experiences of disabled individuals in sexual contexts. Finally, the complexity of individual satisfaction identification, emphasizing that it cannot be reduced to singular biological, physiological, or cultural factors. The findings suggest that wearable-based sensor devices offer potential in assisting individuals with disabilities to explore personal sexual satisfaction identification without the influence of human stereotypes, contributing to the advancement of sexual rights while considering cultural background and gender recognition within society.
Time spent on social media has been an inconsistent predictor of mental health outcomes in young people. However, most studies have assessed social media use globally, with few investigations of the relative influence of specific social media platforms, which may partially account for mixed findings. Furthermore, studies often focus on a single mental health outcome, limiting understanding of how social media relates to psychological well-being. The purpose of the current study was to examine associations between time spent on multiple popular social media platforms and a variety of mental health-related outcomes in a sample of young adults. Participants included 575 young adults who completed an online survey assessing self-reported time spent on Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, and Facebook as well as depression, anxiety, PTSD, loneliness, friend support, and self-esteem. Path analyses showed that in the overall sample, greater use of Tiktok and YouTube were consistently associated with more mental health issues, whereas greater use of Snapchat was associated with fewer mental health issues. Models examining results for men and women separately suggested that use of Tiktok was more relevant in women’s mental health, whereas use of Reddit was more relevant in men’s mental health. Findings highlight that associations are not uniform across social media platforms. More research is needed that compares individual platforms and their relationship to psychological well-being as well as future studies examining how gender impacts findings.
Both parental psychological control (PPC) and state self-compassion have been demonstrated to be associated with depression. However, there remains a need to illuminate the possible direct and indirect pathways among them from a developmental perspective that could serve as intervention targets. Therefore, this study investigated the direct and indirect associations among developmental trajectories of PPC, state self-compassion, and depression in adolescents. A total of 1660 Chinese middle school students (51.93% boys;Mage= 13.51;SD= 0.83) completed self-report measures on 3 time points across 1 years. Latent growth curve modeling was used to examine the direct and indirect associations among the developmental trajectories of the study variables. Results revealed that the developmental trajectory of PPC was positively and directly related to the developmental trajectory of depression, while the developmental trajectory of state self-compassion was negatively and directly related to the developmental trajectory of depression; and the developmental trajectory of PPC was indirectly related to the developmental trajectory of depression via the mediating effect of state self-compassion. The findings elucidated the direct and indirect longitudinal associations among PPC, state self-compassion, and depression, highlighting that interventions aimed at fostering state self-compassion may benefit to prevent the developmental progression from PPC to depression in adolescents.
The positive association between peer attachment insecurity and adolescents’ problem behaviors has been well-documented, but unanswered questions remain about the underlying mechanism and process. The present multi-method research expanded the current knowledge by probing for the mediating role of Machiavellianism in the positive association of peer attachment insecurity and adolescents’ internalizing and externalizing problems. Three independent samples of adolescents (Ntotal=2,947) were used to address these study associations, net of key sociodemographic covariates and social desirability. Robustly replicated findings across three studies revealed that Machiavellianism mediated the positive relationship between peer attachment insecurity and adolescents’ internalizing and externalizing problems. Moderation analysis in Study 2b further indicated that positive family functioning differentially characterized the positive relationship between peer attachment insecurity and Machiavellianism, for betterandfor worse. The current insights into the mechanism and process of this study association punctuate that Machiavellianism, subjective to socioecological conditions (peer-family interaction), serves as an important bridge transferring peer attachment insecurity to adolescents’ problem behaviors.
Previous studies exploring the watching eyes effect with experimental games predominantly employed settings without real-interaction. However, the use of real-interaction setting is crucial for investigating replication and robustness of the watching eyes effect on prosocial behaviours, as prosocial behaviours primarily occur interpersonal interaction. Consequently, the present study comprised five experiments to examine the watching eyes effect on prosocial behaviours using oTree platform, which facilitates real interactions among participants. Furthermore, the current study compares the watching eyes effect across four principal types of prosocial behaviours - namely the Dictator Game, Ultimatum Game, Trust Game, and Prisoner’s Dilemma - in real interaction settings. Our results indicated that in real interaction settings, this effect only occurs in the altruistic behaviour of dictator games. In both Experiments 1a (dictator game in laboratory) and 1b (dictator game online), dictators in the Eye condition distributed more amount to recipient and received a lower payoff than those in the Flower condition. However, the watching eyes effect in ultimatum game (Experiment 2), trust game (Experiment 3) and prisoner’s dilemma (Experiment 4) was not evident. No significant difference were observed in target behaviours between the Eye and the Flower conditions in Experiments 2 (ultimatum game), 3 (trust game), and 4 (prisoner’s dilemma). Our study was an attempt to examine the watching eyes effect in a series of prosocial behaviours with real interaction in one integrated platform, and compare this effect with the same dictator game online and in the laboratory. This study suggests that eye cues can potentially enhance prosocial behaviors in specific contexts such as blood donation and nature conservation, though further replication studies are required to confirm these findings.
The current study examined the associations between internalizing symptoms, social motivation, and gender among autistic and non-autistic youth. Caregivers of 386 participants age 6 to 14 years completed measures of their child’s internalizing symptoms and social motivation. Correlation and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to compare internalizing symptoms and social motivation across autistic and non-autistic girls and boys. Social motivation was found to be higher among non-autistic participants compared to autistic participants, with no significant gender differences observed in social motivation within groups. Social motivation was found to be a significant predictor of internalizing symptoms. The association between social motivation and internalizing symptoms varied by gender and diagnostic status. Higher internalizing symptom scores were associated with lower social motivation among autistic girls, non-autistic girls, and non-autistic boys, but no association was found among autistic boys. The current study found that the relations between social motivation and anxiety, depression, and somatization symptoms in autistic youth varied by gender. The strong association between internalizing symptoms and social motivation among autistic girls and not autistic boys may be due to the unique social experiences and expectations associated with the intersecting gender and neurodivergent identities of autistic girls. The findings of the current study underscore the value of adopting an intersectionality perspective by considering both the influence of gender and neurodivergent identities together when addressing the social experiences and mental health of autistic youth.
Jealousy responses to potential mating rivals are stronger when those rivals display cues indicating higher mate quality. One such cue is vocal femininity in women's voices, with higher-pitched voices eliciting greater jealousy responses. However, cues to mate quality are not evaluated in isolation. The steroid androstadienone (AND) is a putative sex pheromone that makes women perceive ambiguous stimuli as more masculine. We hypothesized that AND would decrease the association between vocal femininity and jealousy, as it induces a perceptual bias that is incongruent with the femininity of the voice. In a double-blind, within-subjects study, 70 heterosexual Chinese women in the periovulatory phase of their menstrual cycle came to the laboratory twice to listen to pairs of voices manipulated to sound more or less feminine. For each pair, the participants selected the voice that would elicit more jealousy if flirting with their partner. The results showed that vocal femininity provoked jealousy under control conditions, replicating previous findings. However, this effect was weakened when women were exposed to AND, suggesting that AND disrupts sensitivity to vocal cues about mate quality in same-sex competition. These results demonstrate a contextual modulation of jealousy responses to sexual rivals.
Over the past two decades, numerous HIV prevention trials have targeted thousands of young African women, aiming not only to reduce transmissions through biomedical interventions but also to promote safe sexual practices through intensive risk reduction sessions. The primary objective of this study was to review the impact of risk reduction sessions in HIV prevention trials conducted in Africa. We assessed changes in sexual behaviors among women enrolled in various biomedical intervention trials across the African region using both visual and quantitative evaluations. Meta-analysis techniques were used to estimate overall odds ratios. In a sub-group analysis, we also used semiparametric regression models to capture important features of the associations between sexual behaviors across the study visits with minimal statistical assumptions. Key time points were identified using the “zero-crossing” technique. Overall summary odds ratio (OR) for condom use in last sex was estimated as 2.21 (95% CI 2.06, 2.36). In our sub-group analysis, women who reported multiple sexual partners declined (adjusted odds ratios (aORs) range: 0.61–0.67) while condom use in last sex improved over time (aORs ranged from 2.22-to-2.60); 347(57%) women HIV seroconverted within the first 6-months which was the most crucial time point with substantial reductions in risky behaviors. This review highlights that the gradual cumulative effect of risk reduction sessions, rather than an immediate substantial impact, may have significant implications in clinical research settings. Effective and sustainable risk reduction programs should include biological components such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce HIV transmission.
Self-regulation of learning (SRL) is a key concept for adaptation and performance at the university, as well as a construct studied by Positive Psychology (PP). Adaptation and success in higher education require from students a broad set of competencies. This study aims to assess different dimensions of self-efficacy, self-esteem, optimism, hope, affects, and life satisfaction of undergraduate students while comparing two student groups in distinct phases of their academic courses (freshmen and seniors). A sample of 1,131 undergraduate students of 63 public higher education institutions from several states of Brazil took part in the study. Some statistically significant differences were found according to course stage and sex of the students. The course stage is a particular differentiator of self-efficacy measures of the students. Those results were analyzed based on the academic experiences of the students, with a focus on some implications for the adaptation processes and academic success of the students in higher education.
Objectives: The review aims to explore the relationship between dispositional mindfulness (DM) and wellbeing, including positive psychological wellbeing and poor physical and mental health in first responders, including police, fire and emergency medical personnel. Methods: A systematic review was conducted, with a search of four academic databases (PsycInfo, Medline, CINAHL, EmCare). Following duplicate removal, screening and forward and backward searches, 27 papers reporting findings from 22 quantitative studies were identified. Quality appraisal of the studies was completed, with a subsection of these peer-rated to increase reliability. Data were extracted, then analysed using narrative synthesis. Results: The findings suggest that DM is positively related to wellbeing in first responders, in terms of higher positive psychological wellbeing and fewer mental and physical health symptoms. Greater DM also attenuated the negative effect of mental health symptoms and stress on their wellbeing. The results indicate that DM may benefit first responders’ wellbeing through its influence on using more adaptive coping mechanisms and perceiving oneself as having greater coping resources and fewer stressors. However, the lack of longitudinal research limits conclusions about the direction of causation in these relationships. Conclusions: DM appears to be positively related to wellbeing outcomes in first responders. Further research exploring positive outcomes, the long-term impact of DM on wellbeing, and under-represented first responder populations would add to the current evidence base.
While the positive impact of meritocratic beliefs on career development is widely acknowledged, little is known regarding how and when meritocratic beliefs contribute to individuals’ career adaptability (CAAS). This work tested the multiple mediation effects of positive affect and career self-efficacy (CSE) between meritocratic beliefs and CAAS and the moderating role of social class in these relationships. A survey study was completed with 409 Chinese college students (46.90% females). The results revealed a positive contribution of meritocratic beliefs to CAAS. Positive affect and CSE were found to sequentially mediate the relationship between meritocratic beliefs and CAAS. Social class could moderate the relationship between meritocratic beliefs and CSE, and the benefit of meritocratic beliefs on CAAS via CSE was only significant among lower-social-class individuals. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of how meritocratic beliefs benefit disadvantaged groups and offers valuable guidance for improving college students’ CAAS.
Negative self-referent memory bias (the preferential memory for negative self-referent information) is a well-known symptom of depression and a risk factor for its development, maintenance, and recurrence. Evidence shows its potential as an add-on tool in clinical practice. However, it is unclear which self-referent memory bias measure(s) could be clinically relevant. Here, as a first step, we investigate which measures best differentiate current depression status and track depressive symptom severity most closely. The total sample (N= 956) from three (naturalistic) psychiatric cohorts with matched controls was divided into a current depression, remitted depression, and non-disordered control group. Self-referent memory bias task measures were calculated and the drift diffusion model (DDM) was applied to assess underlying components of the cognitive self-referent decision making process. Measures were compared between groups and linear regression models were applied to assess their association with depressive symptom severity. The number of negative endorsed words differentiated best between depression status while a combination of the number of positive endorsed words, self-referent negative memory bias, and positive drift rate was most strongly associated with depressive symptom severity. Our results give direction to the clinical implementation of this task. Its value in assessing, monitoring, and predicting depressive state and trait in clinical settings requires further investigation.
BackgroundSchizophrenia is a multifactorial disorder influenced by various biological and psychosocial factors. This study aimed to determine the characteristics and associated factors of expressed emotion (EE) among caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia.MethodsFrom May to July 2024, a cross-sectional study was conducted with caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia across multiple hospitals in Southern Thailand. The study utilized four questionnaires: (1) Demographic inquiry, (2) The Thai Expressed Emotion Scale (TEES), (3) The Thai General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and (4) The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The groups analyzed were compared using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis test, the Student t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed.ResultsIn a survey of 200 caregivers, 70.5% were female. They had a median caregiving duration of 108 months, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 36 to 180 months. Notably, 51.0% of caregivers reported no mental health problems, as assessed by the GHQ-12, while 29.0% indicated experiencing severe burden. The median score on the TEES was 99.0, with an IQR of 84.7 to 109.0. Furthermore, 46.0% of caregivers reported TEES above the median score, indicating high levels of EE. There was also a significant correlation between caregiver burden and EE scores. Those experiencing severe burden had an EE score of 110.5 compared to 94.0 for those with no burden, which was statistically significant (p= 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that high EE among caregivers was associated with factors such as the patient’s duration of illness, caregiver occupation, and mental health status.ConclusionNearly half of the caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia reported high levels of EE, with increased caregiver burden associated with higher EE levels. Factors such as the duration of the patient’s illness, caregiver occupation, and mental health status were also associated with higher EE. Moreover, caregivers’ emotional responses and expressions are complex and dynamic. Thus, focusing on providing support to caregivers can have a positive impact on the well-being of both caregivers and individuals with schizophrenia.
Visual perspective taking often involves transitioning between perspectives, yet the cognitive mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. The current study draws on insights from task- and language-switching research to address this gap. In Experiment 1, 79 participants judged the perspective of an avatar positioned in various locations, observing either the rectangular or the square side of a rectangular cube hanging from the ceiling. The avatar's perspective was either consistent or inconsistent with the participant’s, and its computation sometimes required mental transformation. The task included both single-position blocks, in which the avatar's location remained fixed across all trials, and mixed-position blocks, in which the avatar's position changed across trials. Performance was compared across trial types and positions. In Experiment 2, 126 participants completed a similar task administered online, with more trials, and performance was compared at various points within the response time distribution (vincentile analysis). Results revealed a robust switching cost. However, mixing costs, which reflect the ability to maintain multiple task sets active in working memory, were absent, even in slower response times. Additionally, responses to the avatar's position varied as a function of consistency with the participants' viewpoint and the angular disparity between them. These findings suggest that perspective switching is costly, people cannot activate multiple perspectives simultaneously, and the computation of other people's visual perspectives varies with cognitive demands.
BackgroundPoor quality of life in adults with anorexia nervosa (AN) and persistent high rates of readmission highlight the necessity of developing interventions to optimize treatment outcomes. ECHOMANTRA is a novel online intervention based on interventions for carers (Experienced Carers Helping Others, ECHO) and patients (Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults, MANTRA) with anorexia nervosa. The objective of this paper is to describe the study protocol of a randomized control trial (RCT) aimed at evaluating the efficacy of an adaptation of the ECHOMANTRA for adults AN inpatients and outpatients, and their carers, to be implemented as an add-on to treatment-as-usual (TAU).MethodsIn a multi − center pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), 148 adult AN patients, and their carers, will be randomized to receive treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus ECHOMANTRA. Assessments will take place at baseline (T0), post-intervention (2-month) (T1), 6-month follow-up (T2), and 12-month follow-up (T3). Primary outcomes will be eating disorder psychopathology and psychological well-being. For carers, outcome variables will include psychological well-being, accommodation and enabling behaviors, expressed emotion, illness burden, quality of life and care skills.DiscussionThis study will provide evidence of the efficacy of this novel, online and protocolized intervention in facilitating the recovery of these patients.Trial registrationISRCTN registry (Identifier: 80253157https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN80253157).
ObjectiveThe Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26) is considered the screening instrument of choice to identify eating disorders (ED) symptoms in clinical and community populations, showing a classical three-factor structure. This study assessed whether the factor structure of the EAT-26 in patients with ED was stable at admission and discharge from inpatient treatment.MethodsWe administered the EAT-26 to 207 female adolescents with ED at both admission and discharge.ResultsFactor structure of the EAT-26 at admission comprised of four factors and at discharge three factors and 15-item version of the EAT, producing two factors, was considerably more stable at both admission and discharge. Cutoff score of 23 in the EAT-15 better defined patients as improved at discharge than the cutoff score of 20 in the EAT-26.ConclusionDifferent factor structures of the EAT are found in the same population of young females with ED during the acute stage of illness vs. symptomatic improvement. In addition, shorter versions of the EAT with higher cutoff scores may better differentiate between improved and not improved patients at discharge. Findings suggest that using the EAT-15 is more effective for evaluating a population with clinical characteristics of ED.
With the advent of the digital economy and the post-epidemic era, China’s retail enterprises face significant crises and challenges. Enhancing both the in-role and extra-role service performance of sales staff in physical stores is crucial for preserving competitive advantages and sustainable development of retail enterprises. Based on Conservation of Resources theory, this study proposes a moderated mediation model that elucidates how the perceived service climate impacts employee in-role and extra-role service performance through work engagement, as well as the moderating effect of perceived overqualification. Data were collected from 598 physical store sales staff and 117 direct supervisors across 19 retail enterprises using a multi-wave, multi-source survey. Hierarchical regression analysis confirmed our hypotheses, demonstrating that perceived service climate enhances employee in-role and extra-role service performance via the partial mediating effect of work engagement. Moreover, perceived overqualification positively moderates not only the link between perceived service climate and work engagement but also the mediating effects of work engagement between perceived service climate and in-role and extra-role service performance, separately. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed in detail.
Multiple studies link family conflict to self-harm; however, no research has explored whether family conflict influences adolescents’ likelihood of engaging in a relatively new and destructive behavior known as digital self-harm, or the practice of anonymously posting harmful information about oneself online. Grounded in Agnew’s general strain theory, this study examined the relationship between family conflict and digital self-harm using a sample of 9,819 adolescents from the 2019 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey. Logistic regression analyses revealed that, even after accounting for various potential confounding variables, family conflict was positively associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in digital self-harm. Additionally, results from an analysis of indirect effects revealed that this relationship was largely mediated by adolescents’ depressive symptoms. The study concludes with recommendations for reducing both family conflict and digital self-harm.
We examined participants’ abilities to manually estimate one of two perpendicular line segment lengths using curved point-to-point movements. Configurations involved symmetrical, unsymmetrical, and no bisection in upright and rotated orientation alterations to vertical-horizontal (V-H) illusions, where people often perceive longer vertical than horizontal segments for equal segment lengths. Participants used two orthogonally directed movements for length estimations: positively proportional (POS) – where greater fingertip displacement involved longer length estimation between configuration intersection start position and fingertip end, and negatively proportional (NEG) – where greater fingertip displacement from the screen edge start position toward configuration intersection involved a shorter length estimation between configuration intersection and fingertip end. Length estimations followed most standard perceptual aspects of the V-H illusion for POS estimations, yet differed between upright and rotated orientations for the symmetrical configuration. NEG estimations revealed no illusory influences. Use of allocentric programming likely accompanied POS estimations to explain V-H illusory influences on perceptuomotor control.
People are highly motivated to change their behavior. Unfortunately, many people have difficulty doing so. Building on recent theorizing, we propose that having a larger strategy repertoire (or strategy “toolbox”) can help people achieve their goals. In eight samples across several domains, participants (Ntotal= 2347) reported their use of seven strategies that determined their strategy repertoire for a particular goal. Findings indicated that having a larger strategy repertoire predicted goal attainment. These findings replicated across domains (healthy eating, academic performance, saving money), among self-set personal goals, at both the between-person and within-person levels, and were robust to different operationalizations of strategy repertoire, but differed by behavior. Specifically, having a larger strategy repertoire was associated with better subjective goal progress, healthier eating, and more adaptive financial behaviors, but not snack intake or subjective credit score. Together, these findings highlight that having a larger strategy “toolbox” may have important implications for downstream regulation processes, which sets the stage for lasting behavior change.
Studies using the Approach/Avoidance Task (AAT) paradigm have demonstrated that individuals with heightened levels of spider-fear, as compared to lower levels of spider-fear, are characterised by biased action tendencies, indicated by speeded completion of movements that increase apparent distance between spider-stimuli and themselves (push movements), compared to movements that decrease apparent distance between spider-stimuli and themselves (pull response). Research using training variants of the AAT has also demonstrated that this pattern of action tendencies can be attenuated amongst individuals with heightened spider-fear. However, the effect of this manipulation on behaviour and emotion in the presence of a spider has not been examined. Eighty-eight participants who reported relatively high levels of spider-fear completed a procedure designed to either attenuate avoidance action tendencies for spider stimuli (Approach Spider Condition) or have no impact on action tendencies for spider stimuli (Control Condition). Action tendencies were assessed before and after the manipulation. Participants then completed a Behavioural Approach Task that recorded the number of steps voluntarily taken toward a spider and level of self-reported anxiety at each step. Analyses revealed that avoidance action tendencies to spider stimuli were attenuated in the Approach Spider Condition as compared to the Control Condition following the experimental manipulation, as intended. However, participants in each condition did not differ in behavioural or emotional measures recorded during the approach task. These findings replicate research indicating avoidance action tendencies to spider stimuli can be manipulated amongst individuals with heightened spider-fear, though suggest that their manipulation may not influence ‘real world’ behavioural or emotional responding to spiders.
The collective memory of a given community is premised on the happenings of the past which in turn provides identity to the social groups. Multiple facets influence collective memory in groups, resulting in a shift in collective memory and the group’s social identity. In the present world, the memory of humans heavily relies on digital and technological devices, which results in a bearing on the psychological and social facets of social groups. This has a profound effect on the social identity of the groups, either directly or indirectly. Several studies have shown that social identity has both positive and negative consequences on the psychological and physical well-being of people who belong to social groups. The paper employs social identity and collective memory as a theoretical base in analyzing the filmWall-Eto illustrate our excessive dependence on technology. The paper discusses how the humans in the filmWall-Ehave forfeited their collective memory and social identity. Furthermore, it highlights the fact that excessive reliance and increased consumerism of technology affect the physical well-being of humanity. The paper concludes that change or loss of social identity due to abundant reliance on technology is bound to influence society’s well-being.
ObjectiveTo identify the tools used to assess eating behaviors in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and summarize their distribution, citation rates, journal publication, JCR scores, and psychometric properties.MethodsA literature review was conducted to identify studies on eating behavior in individuals with ASD. The search included various descriptors and combinations of keywords in databases such as Medline/PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, SciELO, and Web of Science. The studies were filtered to focus on articles published in the last five years. Thirty-seven relevant studies were identified and analyzed to summarize the tools used, their distribution in the literature, citation rates, and psychometric properties.ResultsThirty-seven relevant studies were identified. The Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders published the most studies (5). The Brief Autism Mealtime Behavior Inventory (BAMBI) was the most frequently used instrument, appearing in 15 studies, followed by the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS) in 8 studies. Both instruments demonstrated solid psychometric properties, with BAMBI showing good internal consistency (α = 0.88) and BPFAS a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.82.ConclusionMost of the instruments used in studies on eating behavior in individuals with ASD demonstrate satisfactory psychometric properties. BAMBI and BPFAS stand out for their widespread use but are limited to covering only specific age ranges.
The current study aimed to better understand which psychological problems are most impairing, as measured by quality of life and perceived parental psychopathology associations among emerging adults. Participants included 602 college-attending emerging adults who were recruited through an online participant pool at a large Southern United States university. Participants completed measures about quality of life, parental psychological problems, and personal psychological problems. Results indicated that when compared to emerging adults not at-risk for psychological problems, emerging adults at-risk for anxiety problems reported lower psychological, social, and total quality of life and higher levels of parental psychopathology across all domains. Additionally, emerging adults at-risk for anxiety problems reported better physical quality of life than emerging adults at-risk for any other psychological problem and remarkably lower parental psychopathology than emerging adults at-risk for antisocial problems and autism problems. The current study identified the most impairing self-reported psychological problems in emerging adults by assessing quality of life differences.
The use of literal prompts (LPs) and inferential prompts (IPs) in shared book reading (SBR) facilitates children’s use of language and promotes their thinking and understanding about the stories discussed and beyond. Furthermore, SBR provides a platform for mildly autistic children to have multiple rounds of communication with educators. This study investigated the contribution of LPs and IPs on the language development and affective factors of language learning in mildly autistic children. This study included 187 mildly autistic Chinese children who were stratified by random sampling and assigned into three groups (LP, IP and control). The mildly autistic children’s language skills were tested immediately before and after the 12-week SBR intervention. Their parents were also included in this study. The results indicated that using prompts had positive effects on the mildly autistic children’s language skills and on the affective factors central to language development. Moreover, LPs were beneficial in fostering mildly autistic children’s affective factor development, whilst IPs fostered their Chinese word reading and listening comprehension skills. These findings indicated the benefits of using prompts during parent–child SBR, along with the extent to which prompts contribute to different language skills and affective factors central to language development in mildly autistic children.
Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is a group psychosocial intervention for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. Despite evidence supporting its effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and cultural adaptation internationally, CST has yet to be implemented in routine practice outside of the UK. This study consisted of multiple phases. In the first phase, we engaged stakeholders to explore the barriers and facilitators to CST implementation in Tanzania. In the second phase, we developed implementation strategies. In the third phase, we tested these strategies in a study of CST in a tertiary hospital in northern Tanzania. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided the study. We conducted stakeholder engagement with decision-makers, healthcare professionals, people with dementia and their family caregivers (n= 49) to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. We developed an implementation plan that included 20 implementation strategies related to 12 CFIR constructs. Subsequently, we tested these strategies by running eight CST groups with 49 participants. In follow-up interviews with people with dementia, carers and healthcare professionals, we identified 18 key CFIR constructs as barriers or facilitators to successfully implementing CST. CST was compatible with the standards of care in a tertiary referral hospital in northern Tanzania. To implement CST in low-resource settings, we recommend running dementia awareness initiatives, screening for dementia in outpatients and community settings, developing a train-the-trainer model, employing a task-shifting approach, and creating a dementia-friendly space for dementia services. Our findings can inform future efforts to implement CST and other psychosocial interventions for dementia in low-resource settings.
Deverbal formations in Greek, e.g.miˈrazo‘to distribute’< ˈmirazma‘distributing’ are considered morphologically complex lexical items. Previous psycholinguistic studies in Greek and English already highlighted the importance of lexical category and argument structure of the base verb in the processing of deverbal pseudowords violating constraints pertaining to these properties. A similar study in Slovenian brought into light the role of aspectual properties of the base verb during deverbal word processing. The present study revisits the role of aspect in morphological processing of deverbal word formations by looking at Greek. To this end, an offline acceptability judgement task and an online lexical decision task were conducted using different types of pseudowords, violating derivational rules. Results provide evidence that aspect affects deverbal pseudoword processing in Greek. Aspectual rules have a distinct role in relation to categorial and argument structure ones for the suffix that creates formations with unambiguous, eventive readings and which has clear event implications but not for other suffixes. The current study extends the literature to include the role of this feature in the processing of deverbal formations.
IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown experience required finding new resources and lifestyle changes. Understanding people’s behaviors during the pandemic and its potential effects on mental health indicators and well-being is essential for future directions. This study aimed to compare mental health symptoms during Portugal’s first lockdown with normative data, analyze the perceived utility of activities during this period, and explore how these perceptions related to individuals’ mental health indicators and emotion regulation processes (e.g., mindfulness and compassion).MethodsA sample comprising 238 (186 women and 52 men) participants completed an online survey during the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic in April (M1) and June (M2) 2020. The survey addressed the perceived utility of various activities to deal with the lockdown (e.g., exercise). It also included self-report measures of psychopathological symptoms and emotion regulation processes.ResultsNo differences were found between depression and anxiety scores (at M1 and M2) and Portuguese normative pre-pandemic data. During the lockdown, perceived stress was higher than normative data. Reading, being outdoors, talking with friends, video calls, and helping others were scored as very useful. Mean comparisons of emotion regulation processes and psychopathological symptoms based on the utility of activities to deal with the lockdown were reported.DiscussionActivities related to meaningful connections with others and personal activities may be encouraged as protective activities buffering the potentially harmful effect of isolation and external and uncontrollable threats. These findings highlighted the importance of promoting personal health behaviors and emphasize real social connections (e.g., social activities prescriptions).
The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of using probiotics with strains related to dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid production on clinical features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This randomized, controlled trial involved 38 children with ADHD and 42 children with ASD, aged 5–16 years, who received probiotics (Lactiplantibacillus plantarumandLevilactobacillus brevis109/cfu/daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. Parent-reported symptoms were assessed using Conners' 3rd-Ed and the Social Responsiveness Scale Test, 2nd-Ed (SRS-2), and children completed the Conners Continuous Performance Test, 3rd-Ed (CPT 3) or Conners Kiddie CPT, 2nd-Ed (K-CPT 2). Executive functions, quality of life and sleep patterns were also parent-assessed. Intention-to-treat analyses, controlling for sociodemographic and nutritional covariates, revealed no significant inter-group differences in parent-reported or neuropsychological data after the probiotic intervention. However, age-stratified analyses showed improved hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms in younger children with ASD (Cohen’s d = 1.245) and ADHD (Cohen’s d = 0.692). Intra-group analyses supported these findings in the aforementioned age and intervention group for both diagnoses. An improvement in impulsivity for children with ASD was also observed in the intra-group analysis of the CPT commissions scores (probiotic: p = 0.001, Cohen’s d = -1.216; placebo: p = 0.013, Cohen’s d = -0.721). A better comfort score (quality of life) was shown in children with ASD (probiotic: p = 0.010, Cohen’s d = 0.722; placebo: p = 0.099, Cohen’s d = 0.456). The probiotics used, may improve hyperactivity-impulsivity in children with ASD or/and ADHD and quality of life in children with ASD. Further research is warranted to explore probiotics as an adjunctive therapeutic intervention for NDs.Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT05167110.
This study investigates the complex relationships among organizationally prescribed perfectionism (OPP), job stress, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and self-efficacy in artificial intelligence (AI) use in the context of modern workplaces. Drawing on various theories, we hypothesized that OPP would indirectly affect GAD through job stress, and that self-efficacy in AI use would moderate the OPP-job stress link. Using a time-lagged, three-wave survey design, data were gathered from 421 employees across various industries in South Korea. Structural equation modeling and bootstrapping analyses were employed to test the hypothesized relationships. Results indicated that job stress fully mediated the OPP-GAD link, indicating that OPP primarily influences employee mental health through increased job stress. Moreover, self-efficacy in AI use was found to significantly moderate the association between OPP and job stress, such that members with higher AI self-efficacy experienced less job stress in response to OPP. These findings contribute to our understanding of how perfectionistic organizational cultures impact employee well-being through increased job stress. Specifically, our results show that employees with higher AI self-efficacy experienced 21.5% less job stress in response to organizational perfectionism, suggesting that technological competencies serve as a critical buffer against workplace stressors. This study offers important practical implications for organizations, including: (1) the need to balance performance expectations with support systems for employee well-being, (2) the importance of investing in AI training and development programs to enhance employee resilience, and (3) the value of creating organizational cultures that promote both technological adaptation and psychological safety in increasingly AI-integrated work environments.
Despite the widespread prevalence of cancer diagnoses among parents of underage children, there is a limited body of research in this specific area, and even fewer tools have been developed to assess the impact of cancer on parenting roles. The present cross-sectional study aimed to analyze the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Parenting Concerns Questionnaire (PCQ), including its convergent validity with parents’ and children’s psychological distress. A total of 411 adults with cancer and minor children (i.e., < 18 years old; mean age = 12.15 years; SD = 5.11) completed the PCQ and measures of anxiety, depression, children’s emotional and behavioral problems, and quality of parent–child relationship. Statistical analyses indicated good psychometric properties of the PCQ and demonstrated small to moderate correlations with the psychological distress experienced by both parents (anxiety and depression) and children (emotional and behavioral problems). The PCQ proves to be a valuable screening tool that can be easily used by healthcare professionals to identify specific parenting concerns and challenges faced by parents with cancer.
The purpose of this research is to investigate the social antecedents of academic performance over time, as well as understand if a longitudinal view of performance affords greater understanding of graduation and retention. Academic performance across four years was tracked among 1,911 university students. Embeddedness prior to institutional entry was examined alongside high school grade point average and standardized test scores as predictors of performance improvement over time. Embeddedness was also examined as a potentially stronger predictor of performance improvement among ethnic minorities. Results indicate that Black and Hispanic students with greater social ties were more likely to improve their academic performance over time. Additionally, initial academic performance and improvement in performance over time were uniquely related to graduation and retention rates. These results suggest that performance improvement is a novel and valuable conceptualization of academic performance. Further, universities may promote performance improvement by helping newcomers form bonds with current members. Further research may identify the specific supports current members provide to inform structural solutions of such supports. Such research and policy interventions may be of relatively greater benefit for Black and Hispanic students.
To prevent young children’s injuries, studies have considered both child (e.g., temperament, age, sex) and parent factors (e.g., parental supervision and style, attachment) associated with risk-taking behaviors. Building on risk-taking theory literature, Jonas and Kochanska (Jonas & Kochanska, Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology 46:1573–1583,2018) adapted the dual systems model (Steinberg, Developmental Review 28:78–106,2008) to children and suggested that risk-taking propensity arises from an imbalance between the overactivation of the child’s socioemotional system (sensation seeking or traits of surgency) and the lower cognitive control system (lack of self-regulation or of effortful control). However, from an intergenerational transmission perspective, it is relevant to consider the role both parents’ and the children’s socioemotional and cognitive control systems have on a child’s risk-taking behaviors. The current longitudinal study is the first to examines sensation seeking and lack of self-regulation in parents in addition to the child’s surgency-effortful control imbalance to understand the child’s risk-taking behaviors. The sample comprised 177 two-parent families (89 boys) observed at two time points (child age ranges: 12–18 months and 24–30 months). Both parents provided sociodemographic information and completed self-reported questionnaires on sensation seeking and self-regulation, child’s temperament and risk-taking behaviors. Results showed that fathers’ higher sensation-seeking and mothers’ lack of self-regulation were associated with higher children’s risk-taking behaviors. After controlling for these parent factors and child sex, child surgency-effortful imbalance was strongly associated with higher children’s risk-taking behaviors. An adapted dual systems model including both parents (sensation seeking and self-regulation) and children (surgency-effortful imbalance) seems a promising avenue to a fuller understanding of children’s risk-taking behaviors.
The Youth Risk of Cognitive Impairment Toolkit (Youth ROCIT) is a free, online written guide designed to help health and mental health workforces screen for risk of cognitive difficulties in young people aged 12–25. The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) provides a structured approach to behaviour change initiatives for workforces and can be utilised to support the implementation of tools like the Youth ROCIT. Using a modified BCW method, this project aimed to develop and pilot a tailored behaviour change approach to improve screening for cognitive impairment risk using the Youth ROCIT in an Australian youth (12–18 years) drug and alcohol service. The BCW method was applied to understand and address behavioural drivers of cognitive screening within a multidisciplinary team, and design strategies to support the implementation of the Youth ROCIT in routine clinical practice. Data on context, practices, barriers, enablers, and perspectives on the Youth ROCIT were collected through surveys, interviews, and interactive workshops. Routine service data from the patient management system was used to understand behaviour change. Multiple strategies were identified to support the implementation of the Youth ROCIT and the methodology was seen as acceptable and feasible by implementation facilitators and workshop participants. The service team rated the Youth ROCIT as acceptable, appropriate, and feasible, and reported high intentions to use the tool with young people. Service data showed changes in practice following the initiative. The BCW provided an acceptable and feasible framework for developing strategies to support the implementation of the Youth ROCIT in a youth health service setting.
Emotion socialization is a dynamic transactional process that unfolds at the moment during parent-child interactions. To better understand these transactions (both parent-driven and child-driven) in early childhood, we conducted a lag-sequential analysis examining sequential contingency between maternal emotion coaching and child emotion regulation at ages 3 and 4 years. Mother-child dyads in the southeastern United States (N= 208 for age 3 timepoint [101 boys, 107 girls] and 227 for age 4 timepoint [115 boys, 112 girls]) participated in a laboratory etch-a-sketch task, which was videorecorded and later observationally coded for maternal coaching of both positive and negative emotions and for child emotion regulation (indexed as compliance, engagement, and low frustration) at 30-s intervals. At age 3, we found two reciprocal sequences: (1) When mothers coached positive emotions, children were subsequently more likely to show compliance, and when children complied, mothers were subsequently more likely to coach their positive emotions; (2) when mothers coached negative emotions, children were subsequently more likely to display frustration, and when children showed frustration, mothers were subsequently more likely to coach their negative emotions. At age 4, we only found parent-driven, positive emotion–related sequences: when mothers coached positive emotions, children were subsequently more likely to show compliance and engagement. Findings shed light on the distinct functions of positive and negative emotions as well as the intricacy of dynamic emotion socialization transactions in relation to child emotion regulation during early childhood.
BackgroundDespite being the most prevalent eating disorder, Binge eating disorder (BED) remains largely unrecognized and lacks awareness among the general public, where it is also highly stigmatized. Common stigma surrounding BED includes the belief that individuals with this disorder are responsible for their condition and lack willpower and self-control. Research on BED recognition and stigma among lay adults is scarce. Enhancing public recognition of BED and reducing the stigma associated with it is crucial, as this could significantly improve access to treatment. The aim of the present study was to examine BED recognition and stigma within an adult community sample, and to identify associated respondent characteristics, including sociodemographic and psychosocial factors.MethodsA sample of 894 adults (88.6% women; Mage= 35.20 ± 14.52) completed an online survey. Participants were presented with a vignette depicting a woman with BED and obesity, followed by questionnaires assessing BED recognition, stigma, and other respondent characteristics. Independent samples t-tests were performed to compare participants who recognized BED in the vignette with those who did not, based on sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, income, education) and psychosocial variables (i.e., explicit and internalized weight bias, familiarity with BED). A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify the sociodemographic and psychosocial variables that were the most important in explaining the variance in stigma towards BED.ResultsResults indicated that 33% of participants identified BED as the main problem in the vignette. Those who recognized BED were younger, more educated, more familiar with BED, and exhibited lower levels of stigma towards BED. The most significant factor in explaining stigma towards BED was explicit weight bias, particularly attributing obesity to a lack of willpower and disliking people with obesity. Identifying as a man and older age were also associated with greater stigma towards BED.ConclusionThe findings of the current study highlight the importance of comprehensive public awareness campaigns to improve recognition of BED and to reduce associated stigma.
This study investigates the intricate relationships between managers’ bottom-line attitude (BLA) and counterproductive work behavior (CWB) among employees in the context of Egypt’s higher education institutions. Specifically, it examines the extent to which BLA influences CWB and explores the mediating role of organizational cynicism in this relationship. Additionally, the study posits that the impact of organizational cynicism on CWB is further intensified by the moderating effect of ethical individuality. Employing a cross-sectional research design, data were collected from a sample of 357 academic and administrative employees across various higher education institutions in Egypt. The theoretical framework was empirically tested using Composite-Based Structural Equation Modeling (CB-SEM), providing robust insights into the complex interplay between the variables. The findings reveal a significant direct link between BLA and CWB, indicating that a strong focus on bottom-line outcomes by managers is associated with higher incidences of counterproductive behaviors among employees. Furthermore, organizational cynicism was found to mediate this relationship, suggesting that BLA fosters cynicism among employees, which in turn, leads to increased CWB. Importantly, the study highlights the moderating role of ethical individuality, where the influence of organizational cynicism on CWB is amplified among employees with lower levels of ethical individuality. This indicates that employees’ ethical standards and personal values can significantly shape the extent to which organizational cynicism translates into counterproductive behaviors.
Despite the importance of romantic relationships for psychological health, there is limited research exploring how communication about relationships unfolds in families during adolescence and emerging adulthood (beyond the narrower topic of sex). As such, the current research explored the nature of caregiver-child communication about relationships and assessed whether this communication is associated with young people’s psychological health. We hypothesized that young people will have fewer and lower quality conversations about relationships in comparison to other developmental goals but that communication quality would improve with age. We also hypothesized that the quality of relationships communication would predict psychological health as indexed by self-esteem and psychological distress. In a series of two survey studies, adolescents (n= 129) and emerging adults (n= 716) reported on the frequency and quality of communication about relationships (and other developmentally-relevant topics including education, career, race/ethnicity) with their primary female caregiver and reported on their own psychological health. A subset of Study 1 participants additionally completed a daily diary assessing the frequency with which they discussed these topics and/or reported on their psychological health a second time. Results showed that conversations about relationships generally occurred less frequently than other topics and were also seen as the lowest in quality across assessments, though quality did improve with age. Moreover, even when controlling for communication about other topics, the frequency and quality of relationships communication positively predicted aspects of psychological health. Results indicate that young people may benefit from interventions designed to improve family communication about relationships.
Behavior-analytic conferences are integral to dissemination and continuing one’s education and professional development. Organizations that host conferences are charged with inviting speakers to serve as keynote or invited speakers who will provide attendees with informative and engaging behavior-analytic content. However, some research suggests discrepancies between the number of women and men who are invited to serve as keynote and invited speakers at conferences. Research also indicates that the same individuals are habitually serving as keynote and invited speakers at behavior-analytic conferences. These discrepancies in opportunities to serve as keynote and invited speakers can potentially limit the career growth of emerging professionals and the information being disseminated. In the current article, we surveyed all state and regional behavior analysis organizations and analyzed their policies for inviting individuals to speak at their conference. Results indicated that individuals are asked to serve as keynote and invited speakers primarily because of their popularity. Implications and recommendations for designing policies for selecting and inviting conference speakers are discussed.
To develop a Questionnaire of College Students’ Experience of Familiarity with Classmates (QCSEFC) and to test its reliability and validity. Combined with open-ended questionnaire surveys, interviews and literature analysis, the theoretical structure of the college students’ experience of familiarity with classmates was constructed and the preliminarily questionnaire was compiled. A total of 2,301 college students were randomly divided into two groups, with each group used for exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Additionally, 1,680 and 197 college students were selected separately for construct validity testing and test-retest reliability testing. The Subjective Closeness Index, Friendship Quality Inventory, Inclusion of the Other in the Self Scale and the Actual Closeness Scale were used to test the validity of the criterion. The questionnaire contained 21 items, across 4 dimensions (expectations of shared activities,frequency of interaction,positive experienceanddepth of understanding). Confirmatory factor analysis suggests that the four-factor structural model fits well (χ2/df= 6.98, RMR = 0.044, NFI = 0.94, CFI = 0.93, IFI = 0.94, GFI = 0.89, RMSEA = 0.07). The construct validity showed that the scores of each factor and the total score of the questionnaire were positively correlated with the total scores of the criterion questionnaires (r= .49–0.75,P< .01). The Cronbach’s α coefficients, the split-half reliability and the test-retest reliability of the total questionnaire ranged 0.71 to 0.96. The Questionnaire of College Students’ Experience of Familiarity with Classmates (QCSEFC) demonstrates satisfactory validity and reliability.
This study investigated the potential effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and putative mechanisms of change of Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) delivered via videoconferencing with young people who witnessed domestic violence. A naturalistic, mixed-method, AB, interventional single case design was used. Five female adolescents aged 13–17 years were recruited from a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service in the United Kingdom and attended 4–10 video-sessions of the child-friendly NET protocol. Participants completed questionnaires assessing posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), general psychological distress, and trauma memory quality, wore a heart rate (HR) monitor assessing habituation, and were offered a Change Interview. At post-intervention, three participants showed reliable improvement in PTSS, but only one showed clinically significant change. One participant also demonstrated reliable improvement in general psychological distress. Effect size estimates ranged from moderate to very large and indicated change in the desired direction for all but one participant; estimated effects for general psychological distress were more modest. Three participants showed reductions in trauma memory quality, indicating increased integration. Within-session habituation was observed for all participants with available HR data; between-session habituation was also recorded for two of them. The lifeline was mentioned as a helpful aspect of NET, the video delivery was considered both a barrier and a facilitator to engagement, and positive or mixed changes were reported by two participants. Future research with more control and larger samples is needed to answer questions on generality of findings and impact of online delivery; future studies may also include longer follow-up periods and investigate other outcomes.Trial registration numberNCT04866511 (ClinicalTrials.gov).
The term “complex needs” has been used to describe young people who have a range of multiple and co-occurring problems that can be caused by individual level (e.g., psychosocial needs) and broader social-economic factors (e.g., homelessness, child maltreatment, justice system involvement). Coordinating the multiple services required to support these young people and successfully engaging them in services can be challenging. The purpose of this study was to gain deeper insight into the barriers to, and strategies for, service engagement among young people who require support from multiple services. Interviews and focus groups (N = 12) were conducted with relevant government and non-government stakeholders in an Australian jurisdiction to obtain qualitative insights into barriers and strategies for effective service engagement. Thematic analysis identified 20 principal themes that were differentiated into two overarching categories relating to service engagement: 1) Barriers, and 2) Strategies, and across three levels: 1) Systems; 2) Services; and 3) Individuals. Many of the strategies to facilitate engagement were applicable across all three levels. For example, ‘flexibility’ was identified as a facilitator of service engagement from the individual practitioner level to broader service and system structures. This study highlights barriers that need to be overcome, and strategies that can be employed, to facilitate engagement between services and young people who have complex needs. There is a need to create a service environment that is adaptive to the needs of young people rather than one which requires these young people to adapt to any particular service.
Research on individual differences in the degree to which individuals distort information before decision-making is scant though previous research has well documented the predecisional information distortion—a tendency to make a biased decision by evaluating information in such a way as to support concurrent preferences. Focusing on the relationship between regulatory focus and consistency, the present research showed that prevention-focused (vs. promotion-focused) individuals made a greater level of predecisional distortion. Findings from the two studies suggested that those with a prevention focus tended to stick to their initially preferred choice, evaluated subsequent neutral attribute information accordingly, and made a more biased decision than those with a promotion focus.
Willingness to communicate (WTC) is important in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms as engaging in discourse helps to promote students’ language learning skills. Classroom belongingness and classroom enjoyment have been shown to mediate students’ engagement in classroom activities, as well as their relatedness to fellow students. It is therefore suggested that classroom belongingness and enjoyment have an impact on WTC. Despite this potential link, no research has explored the relationship between classroom belongingness, classroom enjoyment, and WTC among elementary students studying EFL. To address this gap, 300 EFL elementary school learners in Iran completed a questionnaire measuring classroom belonging, classroom enjoyment, and WTC. Results indicated that there was a positive and significant correlation among classroom belonging, classroom enjoyment, and WTC. This study highlights the importance of EFL students’ classroom belonging and enjoyment in their WTC and provides several possible explanations for these correlations. These include the role of respect and support from teachers and peers, learners’ engagement, and the fostering of positive relationships and environments.
Acceptance-based skills are widely used in psychological treatments, yet evidence regarding the effectiveness of acceptance as a standalone strategy for downregulating negative emotions is mixed. This study compared two emotion regulation skills from Dialectical-Behavior Therapy (DBT): an acceptance-based skill that encourages radical acceptance of reality (i.e., Radical Acceptance) and a cognitive-change-based skill that encourages reappraisal of negative events (i.e., Check the Facts). In a single session, 92 healthy young adults were randomly assigned to use radical acceptance (N= 46) or check the facts (N= 46) to cope with a personally distressing event. Before and after the session, participants completed an independent emotion regulation task involving exposure to aversive stimuli to assess their ability to engage in acceptance and cognitive reappraisal. The results showed that negative affect induced by the personal distressing event fully returned to baseline among those who used radical acceptance, but not among those who used check the facts. On the emotion regulation task, radical acceptance enhanced the ability to use both acceptance (particularly nonjudgmental awareness) and cognitive reappraisal to downregulate negative emotion more effectively than check the facts. These findings suggest that radical acceptance not only functions as a robust standalone method for emotion regulation but also as a catalyst for other emotion regulation strategies such as those based on cognitive change.
Empathy connects us but strains under demanding settings. This study explored how third parties evaluated AI-generated empathetic responses versus human responses in terms of compassion, responsiveness, and overall preference across four preregistered experiments. Participants (N= 556) read empathy prompts describing valenced personal experiences and compared the AI responses to select non-expert or expert humans. Results revealed that AI responses were preferred and rated as more compassionate compared to select human responders (Study 1). This pattern of results remained when author identity was made transparent (Study 2), when AI was compared to expert crisis responders (Study 3), and when author identity was disclosed to all participants (Study 4). Third parties perceived AI as being more responsive—conveying understanding, validation, and care—which partially explained AI’s higher compassion ratings in Study 4. These findings suggest that AI has robust utility in contexts requiring empathetic interaction, with the potential to address the increasing need for empathy in supportive communication contexts.
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global public health issue that harms both mental and physical health. Sexual and gender minority individuals are more vulnerable to this type of violence due to a history of marginalization, discrimination, and social stigma, which exacerbate the risks and barriers to seeking help. This study aims to map the literature for identifying factors linked to IPV in the LGBTQ + community. A Scope review was conducted by searching databases (Scopus, PubMed, PsycInfo, Scielo, and Pepsic). A total of 143 articles met the final inclusion criteria. Through thematic analysis, three main themes emerged: “Characteristics of Articles on IPV among LGBTQ + Individuals,” “Presentation and Specifics of IPV among LGBTQ + Individuals,” and “Risk and Protective Factors for Different Types of IPV among LGBTQ + Individuals.” Results revealed a prevalence of US-based psychology research, with a focus on Western samples, limiting generalizability. Disproportionate rates of IPV were found among transgender and non-binary individuals, as well as bisexual individuals. Concealing minority identity and lack of professional training hindered identification and help-seeking. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the disproportionate risk of IPV in LGBTQ + populations as more intersectional research and expanded clinical guidelines are needed. Specific areas for future research include the impact of cultural differences on violence experiences and the development of targeted interventions for non-Western sexual and gender minority populations. Despite limitations, this scoping review provides valuable insights. By influencing existing clinical practices, this study underscores the importance of tailored support and comprehensive training for healthcare providers.
ObjectivesPursuing a research postgraduate (RPg) degree is a major life event and could be stressful. The current study aims to explore the effectiveness of an online eight-week mindfulness-based intervention on improving wellbeing and alleviating illbeing among a group of RPg students using a randomized waitlist-controlled design.MethodsA total of 88 RPg students, either studying in Hong Kong or Macau, were recruited (43 were randomized into the immediate intervention group; 67 females; mean age = 27.7; SD = 4.60). The “Finding Peace in a Frantic World” was adopted as the mindfulness-based program. Linear mixed models were applied to test the effects of the intervention on trait mindfulness, compassion, wellbeing related measures (i.e., subjective wellbeing, resilience, wellbeing literacy) and illbeing related measures (i.e., emotional and sleeping disturbances), while controlling for the effects of age and gender. The intervention group was also assessed at two-month follow-up to evaluate the sustained effects.ResultsThe results revealed that participants from the intervention group showed increased resilience (b= 0.88,p= .012), wellbeing literacy (b= 2.52,p= .04), trait mindfulness (b= 5.16,p= .006), and decreased emotional disturbances (b=-8.24,p= .015), while there were no changes in subjective wellbeing, sleeping quality, and self-compassion or compassion towards others compared to the waitlist controls. Positive effects were sustained after two months in the intervention group.ConclusionsThis study provides evidence for online mindfulness training in alleviating RPg students’ emotional disturbance and supporting their resilience and wellbeing literacy.RegistrationThe study was retrospectively registered with the ISRCTN Registry on 11/11/2022 (registration number: ISRCTN18262344).
Drawing on the group engagement model, we propose that the relationship between perceived supervisor ethical conviction and employees’ ethical voice is serially mediated by self-perceived status and moral ownership, as moderated by perceived supervisor moral hypocrisy. Using time-lagged data collected from 281 employees of 56 teams in China, our results show that self-perceived status and moral ownership serially mediate the negative relationship between perceived supervisor ethical conviction and ethical voice. Furthermore, when employees perceive their supervisors to be morally hypocritical, they react more negatively to their supervisors’ ethical convictions and are more likely to withhold their ethical voice. Implications of these findings for theory and practice are also discussed.
Our attention can sometimes be disrupted by salient but irrelevant objects in the environment. This distractor interference can be reduced when distractors appear frequently, allowing us to anticipate their presence. However, it remains unknown whether distractor frequency can be learned implicitly across distinct contexts. In other words, can we implicitly learn that in certain situations a distractor is more likely to appear, and use that knowledge to minimize the impact that the distractor has on our behavior? In two experiments, we explored this question by asking participants to find a unique shape target in displays that could contain a color singleton distractor. Forest or city backgrounds were presented on each trial, and unbeknownst to the participants, each image category was associated with a different distractor probability. We found that distractor interference was reduced when the image predicted a high rather than low probability of distractor presence on the upcoming trial, even though the location and (in Experiment 2) the color of the distractor was completely unpredictable. These effects appear to be driven by implicit rather explicit learning. We conclude that implicit learning of context-specific distractor probabilities can drive flexible strategies for the reduction of distractor interference.
The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to college students, with students who are parents at risk for amplified difficulties due to the dual responsibilities of parenting and pursuing higher education, but there are few studies that compare the experiences of student parents with non-parenting college students. This study employed a quantitative, cross-sectional approach to compare the needs, concerns, and resources of student parents (n= 167) to those of non-parent students (n= 617) at a mid-sized public university in the Gulf South. Data were collected during the Spring 2021 semester using theHigher Education Student and Student Parent Survey(HESSPS). Overall, a greater proportion of student-parents reported resource awareness, receiving social support, and positive experiences with the pandemic compared to non-parent students; significantly more non-parent students reported financial insecurity, academic difficulties, psychosocial and emotional health issues, and negative pandemic-related experiences. However, when the two groups were divided by age (<25 vs >=25 years), older student parents retained the highest proportion reporting social support and positive pandemic experiences and also had lowest proportion reporting academic difficulties. In contrast, young student parents had the greatest proportion reporting academic difficulties and financial and housing insecurity. Recognizing the heterogeneity of student parents, including their strengths in times of crisis, is critical for addressing equity gaps in higher education and for informing targeted policies and resources so these under-recognized students can accomplish their educational and family goals.
BackgroundThis study aims to examine the temporal changes in the incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of depressive disorders as well as its association with age, period, and birth cohort among Chinese from 1990 to 2021, and forecast the future trends of incidence rates and numbers from 2022 to 2030.MethodsData for analysis were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021. Joinpoint analysis was used to calculate the annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC) to describe the rates of depressive disorders. Age, period, and cohort model was utilized to disentangle age, period, and birth cohort effects on rates of depressive disorders. Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) analysis was capitalized to forecast the incidence rates and numbers for different sexes and age groups from 2022 to 2030.ResultsThe age-standardized incidence (ASIR, AAPC: -0.35 [95%CI: -0.65, -0.04]), prevalence (ASPR, AAPC: -0.20 [95%CI: -0.24, -0.16]), and DAYLs (AAPC: -0.28 [95%CI: -0.51, -0.05]) rates of both sexes showed a downward trend from 1990 to 2021, despite a volatility growth in recent years (APC in 2019–2021 of ASPR: 0.96 [95%CI: 0.70, 1.23]). Females exhibited a higher burden of depressive disorders compared to males but experienced a more rapid rate of reduction changes. The burden of depressive disorders was most owing to the age effect and period effect in recent years. The ASIR was predicted to decrease in the whole population (males in 2030: 1,546.3 per 100,000 people; females in 2030: 2,465.8 per 100,000 people), but in children, adolescents, and the elderly demonstrate unfavorable trends in the future.ConclusionThe burden of depressive disorders decreased in China from 1990 to 2021 in terms of age-standardized rates, but increased in recent years. Children, adolescents, and the elderly are the risk groups for future depressive disorders. Considering the large population, the increasing fewer children, and the aging trend, as well as the possible long-term effects of COVID-19 on human psychological burden, more sex-age-sensitive social healthcare programs should be considered in the future to minimize the burden of depressive disorders in China.
Over the past century, numerous studies have examined Jean Piaget’s relationship with psychoanalysis. Until the 1970s, they often emphasized the value of a rapprochement between Piaget and Freud and highlighted the use of Piaget’s ideas in therapeutic practice. Then from the 1980s onwards, several studies focused on the relationship between his work–seen as purely cognitive, to the exclusion of the social and the affective–and his conflicted relationship with his mother. Based on similar sources, particularly his autobiography, these studies led to a reductionist account of his work according to which intellectual content was determined as much by the conflictual relationship as by his alleged autism. The article begins by deconstructing these ideas, showing that in the 1920s Piaget gave an important place to affectivity and the role of the mother in development. It then analyses the Piaget’s family dynamics of the 1919–1920 period, focusing on the family system–Jean’s parents, sisters and brother-in-law–in its relationship to pathology, a dynamic reconstructed with the help of correspondences. The article presents a series of totally unknown episodes in Piaget’s life. It shows that this was an enmeshed family system Minuchin (Families and family therapy, 1974) in which members were both highly involved and dependent on the mother. Within it, Piaget was designated as atherapist, for both the mother and the system, thus reversing standard roles and the classic figure of the designated patient. This research strengthened the few works that have identified either Piaget’s position as a therapist or the importance of his ideas for psychotherapy.
Eating disorders are one of the consequences suffered by individuals who are immersed in intimate partner violence. Knowing that intimate partner violence is a social problem that affects men and women all over the world, it is important to examine and detect which factors affect their physical and emotional health. The aim of the present work was to systematically review the association between IPV and ED. In February 2024, a systematic search of Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO databases was performed. A total of 689 papers were obtained, of which 155 were excluded as duplicates, resulting in 535 articles. After reviewing the title, abstract and keywords, 485 articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria were eliminated. Subsequently, the remaining 50 papers were read and discrepancies were resolved, achieving 87.3% agreement among judges. Finally, 40 papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. The results clearly show the relationship between IPV and various EDs. Being a victim of IPV, in its different forms (physical, psychological and sexual), has been related to disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. In general, some studies found differences between men and women in the association of the presence of sexual violence and ED symptoms. In conclusion, EDs may be a form of control that individuals exert over their bodies in response to the control exercised by their abusive partners. Addressing the interpersonal sphere by focusing on the management of violent dynamics within the couple is the key to change in individual coping.
The matrilineal Mosuo, an ethnic community of 40,000 individuals in Southwest China, uphold a unique family structure characterized by a maternal kin-based household and a dual-residence “Sese” marriage system. Within this system, children belong to their mother’s household, and men assume the responsibility of caring for their sisters’ children, rather than their own biological offspring. Despite its uniqueness, the relationship dynamics within this family system have not been thoroughly examined. This study sought to investigate these multi-generational family dynamics using a psychological projective test. Participants in the caregiver–child pair (\(\:N=36\), First Generation:\(\:N=17\),\(\:{M}_{age}=40.59,\:SD=6.46\); Second Generation:\(\:N=19,\:{M}_{age}=15.74,\:SD=5.59\)) completed the Family Image Test, providing a visual representation of their perceived relationship structures with various family members. The results revealed a distinct family hierarchy within the matrilineal Mosuo family that emphasizes elders’ authority. Interestingly, younger family members demonstrated a tendency to form closer bonds with their parents than the first generation, without compromising their intimacy with maternal relatives. This suggests the existence of a dual family relationship system that encompasses both the maternal kinship cycle and the nuclear family cycle. The dual relationship system of the matrilineal Mosuo reflects the deep influence of matrilineal lineage, cultural norms, and socialization, interwoven with the impacts of integration with the patrilineal Han Chinese and the transformative effects of contemporary socio-economic conditions.
This study investigated the factors influencing teachers’ organizational commitment in China. We employed a survey design with a sample of 506 full-time teachers from various public middle and high schools across mainland China. Social connectedness, job control, and work engagement were measured using self-reported scales. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to examine the hypothesized relationships. The results indicated that social connectedness and job control were directly associated with higher levels of organizational commitment among teachers. Furthermore, work engagement played a mediating role in these relationships. Specifically, teachers who felt more connected to their colleagues and had greater control over their work reported higher levels of work engagement, which, in turn, predicted stronger organizational commitment. These findings highlight the importance of fostering a supportive and collaborative school environment to cultivate social connectedness and provide teachers with greater autonomy and decision-making opportunities to enhance job control. By nurturing these factors, schools can promote work engagement, ultimately leading to a more dedicated and committed teaching workforce.
The Ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) sector is religiously conservative, insular, strictly adheres to Judaism, and considers raising children a central value. This study broadens the research on this sector by examining how conservativeness, parental identity, and parenting behaviors predict parental well-being. Parenting behaviors were assessed by the Parenting Pentagon Model (PPM), which includes five constructs that provide a comprehensive picture of parenting:Partnership,Leadership,Love, Independence, andRules. Participants were 355 Haredi parents (279 mothers, 76 fathers), who completed questionnaires addressing primary study variables. The parents reported being more conservative than open, having a fairly strong parental identity, more optimal behaviors on the PPM, and fairly high levels of well-being. A regression analysis showed that having a child with a disability, conservativeness, parental identity, and the PPM all explained significant variance in parental well-being. A greater understanding of this sector can lend insight into other insular, conservative sectors around the world.
Word recognition is a fundamental reading skill that relies on various linguistic and cognitive abilities. While executive functions (EF) have gained attention for their importance in developing literacy skills, their interaction with domain-specific skills in facilitating reading among different learner groups remains understudied. This study examines the relationship between EF, orthographic awareness, morphological awareness, and Chinese word recognition in 204 Chinese as a second language (CSL) students and 419 native Chinese primary students. Our findings reveal that EF indirectly influences word recognition through orthographic awareness, but not through morphological awareness. The result of group comparison indicates that direct and indirect effects of EF on word recognition are evident in both native and CSL groups. Nevertheless, EF plays a more prominent role in CSL learners. These results contribute to our understanding of cognitive skills in reading and offer significant implications for instructional practices.
Creative performances and problem-solving behaviors have been associated with the phenomenon of operant variability. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies evaluate the effects of operant variability in insightful problem-solving. This research aimed to analyze the relationship between operant variability and its effects on participants’ general performance and type of resolution during a problem situation, using the video game Portal 2. The general procedure had two phases. The Training Phase consisted of a sequence of 12 problems presented in virtual chambers. The Test Phase consisted of a new problem in a new virtual chamber. Twenty-five participants were allocated into five groups: four underwent different Training Phases and one had no training—baseline group (BL). Each one of the four other groups had a different variability training, with or without contact with the objects and stimuli presented in the Test Phase. After the Training Phase, all participants were presented with the same problem in the Test Phase. Our results suggest that operant variability may facilitate insightful behavior depending on the learning history. We discuss the effects of training operant variability and the function of stimuli related to the problem on the type of problem-solving behavior.
Although autistic females often “camouflage” their autism, few studies examine the degree to which adolescent females demonstrate these behaviors in inclusive school settings. We examined: (a) the nature, extent, and underlying motivation of camouflaging in high school; (b) the extent to which autistic girls’ characteristics related to camouflaging settings, people, benefits, costs, and school supports; and (c) how girls’ open-ended descriptions agreed with closed-ended camouflaging ratings. Using quantitative and qualitative analyses, this study examined the extent, domains, costs, and benefits of autistic females’ school-based camouflaging. Thirty-one autistic female adolescents, all included in general education classrooms, answered rating and interview questions. Autistic females camouflaged most often in general education classrooms and with teachers and neurotypical peers that they did not know well; least often at home or with neurodivergent friends. Later age of diagnosis was associated with more camouflaging and camouflaging costs. Qualitative analyses revealed four themes: autistic identity; negative peer experiences; negative consequences of camouflaging; and value of neurodivergent friends. Some qualitative findings converged with quantitative findings, others diverged. Implications are discussed for research and practice for supporting autistic females in general education school settings.
This study investigates parental concerns about the safety of children en route to school in the Western Cape, South Africa, through a survey conducted across nineteen school locations in high- and low-pedestrian crash areas. The density of crash locations closely correlated with low- and higher-income areas. The research reveals a high level of concern among parents in both types of areas, with significantly greater worry prevalent in lower-income neighbourhoods. Although the mode of transportation varied between the two groups, both expressed concerns about their children’s journeys. Notably, these concerns extended beyond traffic safety to include personal security issues related to criminal activity in the neighbourhood. Compared to international studies, parents in this study were more worried about speeding and drunk drivers than general traffic conditions. The study also highlights a stark reality: many parents, especially in lower-income areas, are unable to change their children’s commuting conditions despite their high levels of concern, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. This research emphasises the importance of incorporating parental perspectives in developing strategies to enhance child pedestrian safety.
As mazes are typically complex, cluttered stimuli, solving them is likely limited by visual crowding. Thus, several aspects of the appearance of the maze – the thickness, spacing, and curvature of the paths, as well as the texture of both paths and walls – likely influence the performance. In the current study, we investigate the effects of perceptual aspects of maze design on maze-solving performance to understand the role of crowding and visual complexity. We conducted two experiments using a set of controlled stimuli to examine the effects of path and wall thickness, as well as the style of rendering used for both paths and walls. Experiment1finds that maze-solving time increases with thicker paths (thus thinner walls). Experiment2replicates this finding while also showing that maze-solving time increases when mazes have wavy walls, which are likely more crowded, rather than straight walls. Our findings imply a role of both crowding and figure/ground segmentation in mental maze solving and suggest reformulating the growth cone models.
Here we report four experiments that explore the nature of perceptual averaging. We examine the evidence that participants recover and store a representation of the mean value of a set of perceptual features that are distributed across the optic array. The extant evidence shows that participants are particularly accurate in estimating the relevant mean value, but we ask whether this might be due to processes that reflect assessing featural similarity rather than computing an average. We set out and test detailed predictions that can be used to adjudicate between these averaging and similarity hypotheses. In each experiment, a memory display of randomly positioned bars was briefly presented followed immediately by a probe bar. Participants had to report in a Yes/No task whether the probed feature value was present. In initial experiments, we examine reports of the orientation of white bars and of the color of vertical bars. Then, in companion experiments, we examine reports of the orientation of bars whose color vary, and of the color of bars whose orientation varies. In this way, we test ideas about whether perceptual averaging occurs on a featural dimension that is irrelevant to the task. Currently, it is not known whether perceptual averaging only takes place on a task-relevant dimension or whether it operates more widely.
As personality varies among individuals, even in the same situations, each person carries his or her own unique set of trust in government. The idiosyncrasies of person might have to do with trust in government. An increasing body of empirical work demonstrates the significance of personality in the public sector. However, relatively little is known about how personality affects trust in government. In particular, previous research has not appropriately paid attention on trust in different government institutions. To fill the void, this article aims to examine the impact of personality on trust in government by using the Chinese samples from the World Values Survey. Extraversion is negatively associated with trust in overall government. On the contrary, agreeableness is positively linked to it. Interestingly, neuroticism is positively associated with trust in court and police.
Mental health among medical staff is a critical concern, particularly in the context of the demanding and often stressful nature of healthcare work. Previous research has underscored the buffering effects of self-esteem on psychological well-being, suggesting that higher self-esteem can mitigate the impact of stressors on mental health outcomes. However, the existing literature has not fully explored the nuances of self-esteem profiles within this population and the mechanisms through which it influences mental health. This study aimed to delineate self-esteem subtypes and assess their associations with depression and anxiety in a healthcare context. A cohort of 1027 medical staff were recruited from various institutions in Beijing, China. A latent profile analysis was performed to identify self-esteem subtypes, and mediation analysis was employed to explore the underlying mechanisms of positive coping styles. Our findings revealed two distinct self-esteem profiles: the low self-esteem group (53.2%) and the high self-esteem group (46.8%). Participants in the low self-esteem group reported significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety compared to those in the high self-esteem group (p< 0.001). Mediation analysis demonstrated that positive coping styles significantly mediated the relationship between self-esteem and symptoms of depression and anxiety within both groups. The identification of two distinct self-esteem profiles highlights the heterogeneity in the psychological landscape of medical staff. Medical staff with lower self-esteem were more vulnerable to depression and anxiety, underscoring the need for targeted intervention strategies. Furthermore, the results underscore the critical role of self-esteem and the mediating effect of positive coping styles on the mental health of medical staff, offering insights for targeted psychological support and intervention strategies. Interventions in healthcare practice could focus on enhancing self-esteem and promoting positive coping styles.
The reason why people endorse belief in a just world (BJW), in which each person gets what he deserves and deserves what he gets, is mainly attributed to motivational processes. BJW is also an inter-individual difference, and cognitive preference for less reflective and more intuitive thinking may be a complementary explanation of why people endorse this explicit version of BJW. In a preregistered and highly powered study (N= 46,815), we investigated and showed for the first time a relationship between individuals’ scores on a cognitive performance task and BJW, when controlling for relevant demographics. Our result showed that individuals with a less reflective orientation were more likely to endorse explicit just world beliefs. This is consistent with previous studies based on cognitive reflection test showing that individuals with a lower preference for logical rationality endorsed simplifying worldviews. Our results illustrate that individual differences in cognitive style may produce preferences for specific justice beliefs.
The objective of this study was to adapt and validate the School Anxiety Inventory to a university population, analyzing its factorial structure, internal consistency, convergent validity, and sex differences. The School Anxiety Inventory - University Version (SAI-UV) was administered to a sample of 1,404 Spanish college students (63.82% female and 36.18% male) aged 18 to 49 (M= 21.32). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to analyze the dimensional structure of the SAI-UV. Internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and test-retest reliability (3-week interval) were calculated for the SAI-UV scores. The convergent validity of the SAI-UV was also verified, and sex differences were analyzed. A correlated three-factor structure was found, based on the analyzed school situations (Anxiety about Social Evaluation, Anxiety about Academic Failure, and Anxiety about Aggression). Furthermore, a three-factor structure was found for the anxiety response systems (Cognitive Anxiety, Physiological Anxiety, and Behavioral Anxiety). Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were acceptable. The correlations obtained supported the inventory’s convergent validity. As for sex differences, females obtained higher mean scores as compared to males on all of the factors. Therefore, the psychometric properties of the SAI-UV were satisfactory, determining that it has a reliable and valid inventory for the analysis of school anxiety in university students.
The current study aimed to investigate the effect of competitive anxiety and coach leadership style on track and field athlete performance through the moderating role of coping strategies and emotional intelligence. The purposive sampling technique was used, and data was collected from 297 athlete students from 15 public universities in China. The Partial Least Squares–structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) on Smart PLS software version 4 was used to test the hypotheses. It was hypothesized that competitive anxiety and coach leadership style would significantly affect track and field athlete’s performance. The result revealed that coach leadership style has a positive and significant impact on athlete’s performance but competitive anxiety negatively affects athlete’s performance. Furthermore, the moderators used athlete coping strategies and emotional intelligence. The athlete coping strategies have a negative effect on the relationship between competitive anxiety and athlete performance and a positive effect on coach leadership style and athlete performance. Lastly, athlete emotional intelligence also negatively affects the relationship between competitive anxiety and athlete performance. Therefore, research findings propose that coaches ought to establish a nurturing team environment and embrace a constructive mindset to assist athletes in managing the stress of competition caused by their high performance standards. When coaches demonstrate a positive attitude and confidence, athletes may internalize this perspective and utilize it as a coping mechanism. Besides that, athletes need to understand the worth of different coping mechanisms and how much their anxiety levels affect their performance. Moreover, professional sports psychologists and trainers should work together to guide athletes toward reaching their full potential.
Maladaptive cognition has been demonstrated as the mediator in the association between childhood maltreatment and increased aggression. Dehumanization refers to the perception or belief that self (i.e., self-dehumanization) or others (i.e., other-dehumanization) are less than human. The present study aims to test whether self- and other-dehumanization, as maladaptive cognition about self and others, might account for this association. In study 1, 518 undergraduate students (age: M ± SD = 19.39 ± 0.89) were selected by convenient sampling and completed self-reported questionnaires. The relations were further tested in the social exclusion situation in study 2. We invited 136 college students (age: M ± SD = 18.95 ± 0.80) randomly to play the Cyberball game. Once the game finished, dehumanization, implicit (Aggressiveness-Implicit Association Test, Agg-IAT) and explicit (the hot sauce paradigm) aggressive behavior were measured. The results demonstrated that in study 1, self-dehumanization and other-dehumanization mediated the association between childhood maltreatment and trait aggression. In study 2, although the correlation between childhood maltreatment and explicit aggressive behavior was not significant, childhood maltreatment correlated with implicit aggressive behavior significantly. Moreover, the mediating effects of self-dehumanization and other-dehumanization between childhood maltreatment and implicit aggressive behavior were both significant. Our findings revealed denying humanness to self and others as a newly discovered mechanism by which childhood maltreatment increases aggression. This provides clinical implications that reducing self- and other-dehumanization might be an important way to attenuate the potential adverse effects of childhood maltreatment.
Earthquakes are natural disasters whose devastating effects are widely known and in early February 2023, 11 provinces in Türkiye were deeply shaken. It was important to examine the protective factors against the negative effects of earthquakes to develop effective interventions and significant recovery. Hitherto, research in the literature focused more on the negative effects of the disaster and paid less attention to the conditions under which the forces that support well-being, such as optimism, resilience, and mindfulness. Thus, in the current study, we tested the relationship between Strength-based Parenting and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and the mediating role of optimism, resilience, and mindfulness in such a relationship. 408 university students who survived the devastating earthquake were included in the study. Participants filled out the Strength-Based Parenting Scale, Optimism and Pessimism Scale, Brief Resilience Scale, Mindfulness Scale, and Depression, Stress, Anxiety Scale (DASS-21). In the results, strength-based parenting was found to be positively correlated with optimism, resilience, and mindfulness while negative correlations were detected with depression, anxiety, and stress. Moreover, optimism, resilience, and mindfulness were found to mediate the relationship between strength-based Parenting and depression, anxiety, and stress. In this manner, the results showed that strength-based parenting has a protective role against the negative effects of the earthquake by contributing to optimism, resilience, and mindfulness. Thus, strength-based parenting appears promising in natural disaster studies.
In an era dominated by big data and artificial intelligence, algorithms serve as facilitators across various application scenarios, creating complex layers of interaction. This research develops a theoretical framework based on social exchange theory, social information processing theory, and the stereotype content model to explore user responses to the accuracy and interpretability of algorithmic recommendations and to identify the mediating factors influencing their willingness to engage in value co-creation. The study’s findings reveal that: (1) In high-accuracy scenarios (vs. low-accuracy), users perceive algorithmic recommendations as more competent and warmer, which enhances their willingness to engage in value co-creation, with perceived competence and warmth serving as mediators. (2) In scenarios with strong interpretability (vs. low interpretability), users similarly perceive recommendations as more competent and warmer, increasing their willingness to participate in value co-creation, with perceived competence and warmth acting as mediators. This research provides a practical framework for enterprises offering algorithmic recommendation services, guiding them in fostering greater user participation in value co-creation.
Attachment styles influence mental health and sleep patterns in adulthood, but their relationship with unusual sleep experiences is underexplored. This study investigated how attachment dimensions (secure, anxious, avoidant) relate to the frequency of unusual sleep experiences—including general sleep experiences and lucid dreaming —in depressed patients versus healthy individuals. 232 participants (98 with depression, 134 healthy controls) completed the Persian versions of the Adult Attachment Inventory (AAI) and the Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey (ISES). Depressed patients scored significantly higher on attachment anxiety (p= 0.001) and avoidance (p= 0.043), but not on security (p= 0.629), compared to controls. They also reported higher frequencies of general unusual sleep experiences (p= 0.002) and total unusual sleep experiences (p= 0.005), but not lucid dreaming (p= 0.805). In both groups, attachment anxiety and avoidance significantly predicted higher frequencies of total unusual sleep experiences (anxiety: Β = 1.61,P< 0.001; avoidance: Β = 1.39,P< 0.001) and general sleep experiences (anxiety: Β = 1.27,P< 0.001; avoidance: Β = 1.01,P< 0.001). These findings suggest that attachment anxiety and avoidance are linked to increased unusual sleep experiences, possibly reflecting disturbances in sleep architecture that are more pronounced in depression. Considering attachment styles may be important when addressing unusual sleep experiences and developing interventions for sleep-related issues in both clinical and non-clinical populations.
Willingness to Communicate (WTC) is a critical factor in determining successful second language (L2) learning. Identifying the variables influencing WTC is essential for learners seeking to establish effective communication in an L2. However, several questions regarding WTC remain unanswered. This study aimed to explore how the link between informal digital learning of English (IDLE), basic psychological needs (BPNs), and positive affective variables—foreign language enjoyment (FLE) and grit—influences learners’ L2 WTC. The study examined WTC among 1,056 Chinese university students learning English as a foreign language (EFL) and analyzed five latent variables using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The analysis revealed that both IDLE and BPNs directly predicted WTC. Additionally, FLE and grit served as mediators between IDLE and WTC, as well as BPNs and WTC. This study further underscores the mediating role of positive variables in L2 learning. These findings hold significant implications for future EFL teaching strategies, suggesting that fostering enjoyment and grit through IDLE activities can enhance learners’ WTC.
BackgroundIntertemporal choices are the process by which people make choices about losses or gains at different points in time (near or far). To explore the relationship between font color and intertemporal choice and to examine the serial mediation of time perception and intradimensional difference comparison on the association between font color and intertemporal choice on the basis of attribute-based choice models.MethodsWe randomly assigned subjects to the intertemporal choices questionnaire in a specific font color (blue vs. red) condition. The Intertemporal Choice Task, the Subjective Duration Judgment Task and the Intradimensional Difference Comparison Task were administered to a sample comprising 210 college students (103 males accounting for 49.05%). Multivariate analysis and latent variable analysis were used to explore the separate mediating roles of time perception and intradimensional difference comparison in the association between font color and intertemporal choice, and their serial mediation was also investigated. The bootstrap method was employed to test the significance of these mediating effects.ResultsCompared with red font, blue font can encourage students to choose more-farsighted intertemporal choices (i.e., LL). Students who use the blue font are more likely to have shorter durations and can choose the more farsighted intertemporal choice (i.e., LL) than those who use the red font. Students using blue fonts are more likely to perceive the difference between the two options chosen across time (∆payoffA, B) to be greater than the difference between the two options in the payoff dimension (∆timeA, B), leading to farsighted choices compared with those using red fonts. Serial mediation was also found.ConclusionThe findings revealed why font color influences intertemporal choice. This study revealed the mediating role that time perception and intradimensional difference comparison play in the association between font color and intertemporal choice.
The evaluation of social communication and interaction (SC/I) behaviors is foundational to the autism identification process. However, this type of evaluation is made difficult by the fact that SC/I is a construct in which perceptions and expectations are largely influenced by norms and attitudes of different sociodemographic groups. While there are many factors that influence differences in SC/I behaviors across sociodemographic groups, one factor that may be especially important is the perceived value of these behaviors. The purpose of this study is to investigate which sociodemographic factors influence the perceived importance of SC/I behaviors among caregivers of children and adolescents. Caregivers (n= 398) living in the United States completed the Social Communication and Interaction Perceptions Scale (SCIPS). Linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate the relationship between the perceived importance of SC/I behaviors and seven sociodemographic factors as well as determine if this relationship was moderated by SC/I behavior type (i.e., foundational vs. advanced behaviors). Several different sociodemographic factors (i.e., caregiver race/ethnicity, caregiver gender, household income, child disability status, child age, child gender) were associated with caregiver ratings of the perceived importance of SC/I behaviors. This relation was, in some instances (i.e., caregiver race/ethnicity, caregiver gender, child disability status), moderated by whether the SC/I behaviors were foundational or advanced. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the values of caregivers regarding perceived SC/I importance during the autism identification process.
Educational researchers have a long-lasting interest in the strategies examinees employ when responding to items in an assessment. Mixture item response theory (IRT) modeling is a popular class of approaches to studying examinees’ item-response strategies. In the present study, we introduce a response time (RT)-based mixture IRT model for flexible modeling of examinee-and-item-specific item-response strategies. We posit that examinees may alternate between ability-based and non-ability-based strategies across different test items. Our proposed model identifies such within-examinee strategy switches without the need to predefine the non-ability-based strategies. Instead, our proposed approach allows for inferring the nature of these strategies from model parameter estimates. We illustrated the proposed approach using empirical data from PISA 2018 Science test and evaluated it through simulation studies. We concluded the article with discussions of limitations and future research directions.
Adolescence is a developmental period of relative volatility, where the individual experiences significant changes to their physical and social environment. The ability to adapt to the volatility of one’s surroundings is an important cognitive ability, particularly while foraging, a near-ubiquitous behaviour across the animal kingdom. As adolescents experience more volatility in their surroundings, we predicted that this age group would be more adept than adults at using exploration to adjust to volatility. We employed a foraging task with a well-validated computational model to characterise the mechanisms of exploration in volatile environments, preregistering the hypothesis that adolescents (aged 16–17;N= 91) would exhibit more optimal adaptation of their learning rate to changes in environmental volatility compared with adults (aged 24+;N= 90). However, surprisingly, both adolescents and adults exhibited suboptimal adjustment of their learning rate to environmental volatility. In contrast to the learning rate, it was instead participants’stochasticity(i.e., decision variability) that better resembled the adjustment to volatility made by the optimal RL agent. Although heightened stochasticity in the volatile environment led participants to more often trial different responses that facilitated discovery of changes to the environment, we also found that anxiety impaired this adaptive ability. The finding of heightened stochasticity in volatile environments contradicts expectations that the learning rate is responsible for successful adaptation and motivates future work on the deleterious role that anxiety plays when adolescents manage periods of transition.
Perceptual categorization is arguably a decision-making task. Lab-based, perceptual categorization research tends to ask participants to classify objects into one of a small set of fixed categories. Decision-making research, however, has revealed a number of choice phenomena that emerge as a function of the size and composition of the choice set. In the current work, we explore the possibility that two rational principles of choice may be violated in categorization: independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) and regularity. Critically, such violations deviate from predictions of the Luce Choice Rule, which is assumed by the Generalized Context Model (GCM). The empirical framework used to test for these violations is borrowed from the decision-making phenomenon of the attraction effect. We tested two variations of this paradigm, which involves multiple categories. In the first variation (Experiments 1a and 1b), the set of learned categories varied across participants. In the second variation (Experiments 2a and 2b), the test choice sets varied within participants for a common set of learned categories. Both IIA and regularity were violated when the set of learned categories varied across participants, but they were not violated when the choice sets were varied given a fixed set of learned categories. The GCM can account for the violations, but only by adopting response bias parameters that vary across conditions. These data point to emergent phenomena when classifying stimuli into multiple categories.
Dyssynergic defecation(DD) is the inability to coordinate abdominal and anorectal muscle contraction during defecation. Patients with constipation often report poor quality of life, sleep issues, and increased risk of mood disorders. Biofeedback is a recommended treatment for DD. we evaluated the effect of EMG-biofeedback on constipation symptoms as the primary outcome and also on insomnia, mood disorders (depression and anxiety), and quality of life as secondary outcomes in patients with dyssynergic defecation. Thirty-one patients with DD (74.2% women, mean age 46.23 ± 13.42 years), diagnosed using Rome IV criteria, Bristol Stool Form Scale, and anorectal manometry, were included. Patients underwent six to ten sessions of EMG-based biofeedback. We evaluated symptoms using the Wexner constipation questionnaire, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), SF-36 for quality of life, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Hamilton questionnaires for anxiety and depression (HAM-A and HAM-D) before and after treatment. As consistent with study hypotheses, the Wexner scores significantly improved after biofeedback (p < 0.0001,t = 6.98). ISI scores improved (p = 0.01, t = 2.74), as did VAS scores (p < 0.0001, t = 5.14). HAM-A and HAM-D scores showed significant reductions (HAM-A: p = 0.0001, t = 5.01; HAM-D: p = 0.003, t = 2.17). However, SF-36 did not show significant improvement in quality of life (p > 0.05, t = -0.93). Biofeedback effectively improved constipation symptoms, insomnia, and mood disorders but did not impact quality of life.
Post-traumatic stress and major depressive disorders are associated with “overgeneral” autobiographical memory, or impaired recall of specific life events. Interpersonal trauma exposure, a risk factor for both conditions, may influence how symptomatic trauma-exposed (TE) individuals segment everyday events. The ability to parse experience into units (event segmentation) supports memory. Neural state transitions occur within a cortical hierarchy and play a key role in event segmentation, with regions like the occipital cortex, angular gyrus, and striatum involved in parsing event structure. We examined whether interpersonal trauma exposure was associated with alterations in the cortical hierarchy and striatal activity at neural state transitions in symptomatic TE versus healthy control (HC) individuals. Fifty older adolescents and young adults (29 TE, 21 HC) viewed the film “Partly Cloudy” during functional magnetic resonance imaging. A greedy-state boundary search algorithm assessed the optimal number of events, quality, and segmentation agreement of neural state transitions in the occipital cortex and angular gyrus. Striatal (nucleus accumbens, caudate, and putamen) activity was assessed at occipital and angular gyrus-evoked state transitions. Compared to HCs, TE participants displayed less occipital and greater angular gyrus-evoked optimal number of neural state transitions. TE participants also displayed lower quality of neural state segmentation solutions in occipital and angular cortices compared to HCs. Additionally, TE participants had less putamen activity at angular gyrus-evoked state transitions than HCs. This investigation provides neurobiological insights into aberrant event segmentation in symptomatic TE individuals, shedding light on mechanisms influencing overgeneral memory in trauma-related disorders.
The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on mental health is challenging to quantify because pre-existing risk, disease burden and public policy varied across individuals, time and regions. Longitudinal, within-person analyses can determine whether pandemic-related changes in social isolation impacted mental health. We analyzed time-varying associations between psychiatric vulnerability, loneliness, psychological distress and social distancing in a US-based study during the first year of the pandemic. We surveyed 3,655 participants about psychological health and COVID-19-related circumstances every 2 weeks for 6 months. We combined self-reports with regional social distancing estimates and a classifier that predicted probability of psychiatric diagnosis at enrollment. Loneliness and psychiatric vulnerability both impacted psychological distress. Loneliness and distress were also linked to social isolation and stress associated with distancing, and psychiatric vulnerability shaped how regional distancing affected loneliness across time. Public health policies should address loneliness when encouraging social distancing, particularly in those at risk for psychiatric conditions.
Several studies have established the association between social comparison and aggression. However, the underlying mechanisms of the linkage between social comparison and adolescents’ aggression have received limited attention. This study examined social comparison conditions (upward social comparison, downward social comparison, and non-comparison condition) differences in aggression and self-control, and whether differences in aggression were mediated by self-control. A sample of 173 mainland Chinese adolescents (Mage= 13.23 years,SD= 0.83, ranging from 12 to 15) was randomly allocated to the upward social comparison group (n= 59), downward social comparison group (n= 54), or the non-comparison group (n= 60). The results showed that adolescents in the upward social comparison group exhibited the most aggression and the lowest level of self-control, while no significant differences were observed between the downward social comparison and non-comparison groups concerning aggression and self-control. Furthermore, the multicategorical mediation analysis demonstrated that self-control partially mediated the association between the upward social comparison group and aggression relative to the non-comparison group. That is, adolescents in the upward social comparison group displayed lower levels of self-control, which in turn correlated with increased aggression when compared to the non-comparison group. Our findings identified the internal mechanisms of adolescent aggression and provided preliminary evidence for future interventions to decrease adolescents’ aggression within the social context.
BackgroundChild maltreatment in daycare is a public health issue. As childcare is stressful, high care provider negativity independently predicts more internalizing behaviour problems, affecting children’s psycho-neurological development. This study aimed to determine psychosocial factors associated with the mental health of preschool care providers in Kuala Lumpur.MethodsA random cluster sampling cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2019. The study involved registered care providers for preschoolers under four years old without acute psychiatric illness. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (Malay-CES-D) and Karasek’s Job Content Questionnaires (Malay-JCQ) were used to assess depression symptoms and psychosocial job-related risks. Logistic regression (p< 0.05) guided by the Hosmer-Lemeshow strategy was used for analysis, with the final model evaluated for assumptions and goodness-of-fit.ResultsA total of 247 providers were recruited from 36 preschools. All respondents were females, with a mean age of 32.1 years old, Malays (70.4%), married (55.0%), attained a diploma and above (50.6%) and had low income (80.1%). The prevalence of depressive symptoms and job strain was 28.7%. Final logistic regression revealed individual factors (married, stressful life events: assault and marital issues), job strain (AOR = 2.33, CI = 1.22, 4.44), and job insecurity (AOR = 1.29, CI = 1.07, 1.56) determine depressive symptoms. Good supervisor support was inversely associated with depression.ConclusionsJob strain and insecurity contribute significantly to depressive symptoms among preschool care providers in Kuala Lumpur. The Social and Welfare Department can promote supportive supervision through skill training for supervisors, fostering a positive mental health environment for improving workers’ mental health.
Research on human language started to change when Murray Sidman and colleagues demonstrated that a participant was able to derive unreinforced stimulus relations after conditional discrimination training. This work provided the basis for a novel approach to research on symbolic behavior and fostered the development of three main theoretical accounts: stimulus equivalence (SE), relational frame theory (RFT), and naming theory (NT). These accounts unfolded in the last decades of the twentieth century, promoting intense debate and discussion within behavior analysis. Although experimental research emerging from these three accounts is still highly active today, the theoretical discussions have, to a large extent, faded. Considering the importance of rekindling a dialogue, this article aims to describe the differences among the three accounts, but focus on their common points. We conclude by arguing that developing a more complete behavior-analytic account of human language would be served best by considering both research and theoretical analyses of SE, RFT and NT. Finally, we provide examples of two successful research groups that adopted this approach and in doing so have advanced our understanding of language within behavior analysis.
An organization that functions as an intermediary has been described as an entity that engages in the support of many programs while also building capacity for the implementation and delivery of programs locally so that they may be successfully sustained over time. The role of the intermediary in the distribution and support of usable innovations and evidence-based programs must be clearly defined if the functions of the intermediary, as well as the evidence-based programs, are to be sustained and scaled. Effective intermediary organizations require consistent attention to program implementation strategies and to integrating principles related to race equity within the structures and functions of intermediary organizations so that all children and families can benefit from usable innovations. This paper provides case examples of two intermediary organizations in the United States. We describe how they use the Active Implementation Frameworks to support the implementation of evidence-based practices and their organizational efforts to operationalize equity throughout their intermediary structure and functions.
Gender inequalities are pervasive across various life domains, yet research has often overlooked how people perceive that women are treated differently than men. To fill this gap, we developed and validated the 16-item multidimensional Social Treatment and Experiences of Women (STEW) scale across different samples of women and different cultural contexts, namely Italy and the UKN= 1,195). Using exploratory (Study 1,N =703) and confirmatory (Study 2,N =550; Study 3a,N =132; Study 4,N= 201; Study 5,N= 233) factor analysis, we identified four dimensions: workplace inequalities, domestic imbalance, harassment towards women, and social expectations. Studies 3a and 3b (N =96) demonstrated convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of the STEW, linking the STEW’s subscales to group-based emotions, reported experiences of sexism, attitudes towards affirmative action, and attitudes towards women’s sexual freedom. Replicating the factor structure in the UK, Study 4 found the STEW explained unique variance in group-based emotions and intergroup attitudes beyond personal experiences of sexism. Last, Study 5 showed that the STEW explains unique variance in collective action intentions and feminist identification beyond people’s attitudes towards gender equality. Highlighting the importance of conceiving gender inequalities as a multifaceted issue, the STEW provides a robust tool for assessing perceptions of differential treatment of women across domains and can inform more comprehensive interventions promoting gender equality.
This research uses a self-report questionnaire to examine how humour styles based on Martin’s taxonomy (affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating) may moderate the relationship between Dark Triad personality traits (Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy) and bullying behaviors among 662 university students. Significant positive correlations between Dark Triad traits and bullying emerged, as well as gender, with males scoring higher in all variables. Moderation analyses showed that affiliative humour reduced the impact of narcissism on bullying, while aggressive enhanced it. Additionally, self-enhancing and aggressive humour increased the impact of psychopathy on bullying behaviors. These results suggest that humour styles play a crucial role in the dynamics of bullying in relation to Dark Triad personality traits, offering new insights for intervention strategies.
ObjectivesIntuitive eating is a healthy and positive eating behavior. Previous research has indicated that intuitive eating is associated with body appreciation, which may be enhanced through self-compassion. This study developed and evaluated the effectiveness of a self-compassion-based intuitive eating intervention, titled Be Friends with Yourself and Food (BFYF), on intuitive eating, self-compassion, and body appreciation. Additionally, it explored the pathways from self-compassion to body appreciation and intuitive eating in a Chinese population.MethodsOne-hundred Chinese adults were randomly assigned to BFYF group and waitlist group. Three-week intervention to improve self-compassion, body appreciation and intuitive eating included psychoeducation about intuitive eating and meditation practice based on self-compassion. Data were collected before intervention of BFYF group (T0), after intervention for each group (T1 and T2) and 1 month after intervention for each group (T3 and T4).ResultsBFYF significantly increased self-compassion, intuitive eating, and body appreciation, and all the changes were maintained at the 1-month follow-up. BFYF improved intuitive eating directly and via self-compassion.ConclusionThe current study supported BFYF as a promising intervention to enhance intuitive eating, self-compassion, and body appreciation. It also illustrated how self-compassion benefits positive eating behaviors.
Bullying is a serious public health issue for adolescents in the United States. Previous studies have demonstrated associations between self-esteem, anxiety/depressive symptoms, and bullying victimization (BV); however, these relationships have not been extensively studied considering the overlap of social identities of Latinx adolescents living with obesity and overweight (LAWO), who are more likely to be victims of bullying. The current study aims to address these gaps by examining the relationship between BV and anxiety/depressive symptoms and the role of self-esteem while considering sex differences among LAWO (N= 139; female:n= 77, 55.4%; mean age = 12.9 years). Results for overall group showed that BV significantly predicted anxiety/depressive symptoms and self-esteem significantly mediated this relationship. Multigroup mediation analysis resulted in significant mediation by self-esteem for females. Results suggest that interventions that target self-esteem and consider culture would be beneficial for female LAWO.
Family relationships and family life are important protective factors for psychological health. Establishing healthy communication between members of a family is important for the happiness of individuals. There are several cross-sectional findings regarding family communication in the literature. A longitudinal design was used to examine the mediating effect of cognitive flexibility in the relationship between family communication and happiness, taking into consideration the limitations of the cross-sectional design. In this study, data from the Turkish adult sample (N= 277) was collected in two waves at four-month intervals. The ages of the sample group [195 (70.4%) female and 82 (29.6%) male] are between 20 and 55. The average age was calculated as 29.66 (SD = 8.27). We used the cross-lagged panel model for the half-longitudinal mediation model for testing mediation with two time points at four-month intervals. The findings revealed that the variables of the study had significant longitudinal associations, and cognitive flexibility played a longitudinal mediating role in the relationship between family communication and happiness. The current results prove the importance of healthy relationships among family members and highlight the significant influence of family communication and cognitive flexibility on happiness.
Among a large sample of youth (9–10 years old at baseline) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study®(n= 11,661) we modeled trajectories of psychopathology over three years and associated risk and protective factors. Growth mixture modeling characterized latent classes with distinct psychopathology trajectories. Results indicated four different internalizing trajectories: a high-decreasing class, a moderate-decreasing class, a moderate-increasing class, and a low-stable class. There were also four externalizing trajectories: a moderate-decreasing class, a high-decreasing class, a moderate-increasing class, and a low-decreasing class. We used parallel process growth analysis to examine the co-development of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and characterized five trajectory classes with distinct patterns of co-development. These classes were differentially associated with negative life events, neighborhood safety, and parental acceptance. Together, the findings characterize general developmental patterns of psychopathology, quantify the proportion of youth that follow each pattern, and identify key predictors that discriminate these patterns.
This study aims to provide a novel perspective on why and how abusive supervision originates. Drawing upon reactance theory which argues that restrictions on individuals’ desired behavior cause a threat to their sense of control and, in turn, invokes the threatened individuals’ reactance, we propose that supervisors’ experience of being ostracized by peer coworkers thwarts the ostracized supervisors’ sense of control, eventually triggering their abusiveness toward subordinates. We further suggest that supervisors’ perception of their power is a critical boundary condition of this mediation mechanism, such that for those supervisors with weaker, rather than stronger, perceived power, the ostracized experience damages their sense of control in a greater extent and thus causes more severe abusive supervision. In Study 1, using an experimental design with manipulations of workplace ostracism by peer coworkers and perceived power, we find support for our moderated mediation model. Study 2 replicates the findings with field survey data from South Korea. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our research.

Empathy is multifaceted, involving sharing and understanding the emotional and mental states of others. This study investigated the factor structure of the English-language version of the Empathy Quotient for Children (EQ-C; Auyeung et al.,2009), an empathy measure previously well-validated only as a global scale. We aimed to compare children with and without educational differences (i.e.,Special Educational Needs & Disabilities, SEND), and explored associations between empathy and sensory sensitivities across the whole sample. Based on responses from 680 parents, we analysed data from English-speaking children aged 6–12 years, via a series of factor analyses using polychoric correlation matrices and bass-ackward analysis. Empathy domain profiling for children with SEND status (versus children without SEND status) was investigated as group differences (t tests). Sensory sensitivities were examined via associations (correlation) and net effects (regression). We identified an optimal four-factor solution (emotional empathy,social-cognitive empathy,negative interactions,antisocial behaviours), and robust higher order one-, two- and three-factor models. Children with SEND status displayed empathy differences across all four empathy domains (allp< .001). Children with greater sensory sensitivities displayed significant differences forsocial-cognitive empathyandnegative interactionsonly (bothp< .001). We demonstrated the potential utility of the English-language EQ-C as a domain-level measure of empathy. Our paper discusses how the domains align with traditional emotional and cognitive dimensions in adults and cross-culturally. Our empathy profiles can be used alongside global empathy measures for different groups of children, with and without educational differences and sensory sensitivities.
This study examined the effects of virtual exercise participation on leisure motivation, psychological well-being, and performance outcomes. A sample of 110 university students (Xage = 21.49 ± 1.82) participated in a virtual cycling simulation over an approximate eight-week period, performing individually, in a group setting, and then as teammates with an unfamiliar partner. For each session, performance indicators—completion time, average heart rate, cadence, power output, and calorie expenditure—were recorded. The Leisure Motivation Scale and Psychological Well-Being Scale were administered before the initial ride and after the final ride. Analysis using Repeated Measure ANOVA (Analysis of variance) revealed significant differences in performance metrics across the three exercise conditions. Pairwise Comparisons with Bonferroni correction indicated specific differences between group configurations, and a Paired Sample t-test showed notable changes in leisure motivation and psychological well-being from pre- to post-test. These findings highlight the role of social context in virtual exercise performance and its impact on participants’ motivational and psychological outcomes.
The diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) in young children has been a topic of debate, in part owing to varied interpretation of manic-like symptoms. We examined how expert academic clinicians participating in the pediatric bipolar biobank varied in their interpretation and application of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria and diagnoses. Study co-investigators reviewed 12 standardized narratives and for each marked a visual analog scale with their confidence in the presence of manic episodes and criteria. We analyzed raters’ confidence and inter-rater agreement using interclass correlation (ICC). Symptoms with good ICC ranging from 0.60 to 0.74 included inflated self-esteem/grandiosity and decreased need for sleep. Diagnoses and episodes with poor ICCs (< 0.4) included Hypomania and Bipolar Not Elsewhere Classified/Not Otherwise Specified. Despite efforts made to refine BD criteria with DSM-5, there was substantive variation in diagnostic interpretation among investigators working with children presenting with manic-like symptoms.
There have been disparities reported in prevalence of autism by gender, race, and socioeconomic status with older ages of diagnosis in non-White and in female children. Possible disparities in the ages of autism diagnosis are not well-established within the Military Health System (MHS) pediatric population, where we hypothesized less disparities given universal Tricare coverage for active-duty military families and theoretically equal access to the military treatment facility (MTF). We conducted retrospective cross-sectional analysis using deidentified database repository records from the MHS. We collected and analyzed demographic data on children covered by Tricare and newly diagnosed with autism within an MTF (N = 31,355) or outside of the MTF (5,579 respectively). Within the MTF, we identified younger ages of autism diagnosis in non-White children less than 18 years old (p < 2.2e−16), without significant differences in ages of diagnosis by race in children less than 6 years of age. There were no statistically significant differences in ages of diagnosis between males and females. Outside the MTF, we identified younger ages of autism diagnosis in males versus females with statistically significant difference in average ages of autism diagnosis between males and females less than the age of 18 years (p = 4.4e-08). This difference was not seen in children less than 6 years of age. Racial data was not available for diagnosis outside the MTF. The age of autism diagnosis in the military pediatric population within the MTF did not reflect historical disparities seen in non-White and in female children.
BackgroundA happy adolescent may live a healthy and successful life. This study focused on parental expectations in the Chinese cultural context and investigated whether and under what conditions adolescents’ perceived parental expectations are associated with their happiness, the affective component of subjective well-being.Sample and methodsThis cross-sectional study included a sample of 1510 Chinese adolescents; the average age of the adolescents was 12.39 years, and 55.40% were boys. A questionnaire including the perceived parental expectations scale, self-efficacy scale, connectedness subscale and one item that measured happiness was administered to the adolescents.ResultsThe results reveal that self-efficacy moderates the relationship between perceived parental expectations and happiness. For adolescents who exhibit higher levels of self-efficacy, perceived parental expectations are negatively correlated with happiness; in contrast, for adolescents who exhibit lower levels of self-efficacy, perceived parental expectations are not related to happiness. Moreover, the results reveal that connectedness moderates the relationship between perceived parental expectations and happiness. Among adolescents who exhibit higher levels of connectedness, a nonsignificant relationship is observed between perceived parental expectations and happiness; in contrast, among adolescents who exhibit lower levels of connectedness, perceived parental expectations are negatively related to happiness.ConclusionsThis study reveals that, under conditions featuring higher levels of self-efficacy or lower levels of connectedness, perceived parental expectations are not conducive to their happiness. These findings have important implications with regard to parenting practices.
Proponents of schema focused therapy (SFT) have accrued a growing and persuasive evidence base that indicates it as one of a small number of treatments for personality difficulties and associated issues. However, unlike other treatments, SFT’s focus has predominantly remained on adults with enduring and chronic psychopathology. This comprehensive narrative review firstly aims to articulate the theoretical application of SFT as a means of addressing suitable psychological vulnerabilities and associated issues with adolescents. In addition, the review aims to highlight the potential use of SFT techniques when integrated into parental interventions as a means of strengthening the parent-child relationship. Finally, the review aims to synthesize the accumulation of SFT research applicable to work with adolescents and parents with a view towards delineating future treatment development and clinical application among a wide range of mental health and social care professions.
This volume makes a notable contribution with a deep and extensive analysis to achieve the movement from Yoga Philosophy to Yoga Psychology for the promotion of integration with Modern Psychology, a task hitherto unrealized despite the burgeoning attention to Yoga. This commentary is constrained by my own limited knowledge of traditional Indian philosophy in making a thorough examination of Paranjpe’s contribution beyond attention to selected concepts and sporadic illustrations from the original volume. Yoga practice is, Paranjpe informs us, just the tip of an immense consolidation of knowledge, deep intellectual thought and theoretical consideration about the embodied sense of self, health and well-being. Spirituality is foundational to the theory and practice of yoga. This volume has immense potential relevance for contemporary psychological theory and practice in an attempt to highlight embodied and spiritual considerations of human existence. With some notable exceptions, modern psychology has adopted the positivistic paradigm that systematically rejects traditional knowledge systems. Through intercultural translation (a concept I borrow from Santos,2018), Paranjpe successfully transcends this divide and provides detailed possibilities about why and how this knowledge can relate to, inform and expand the science of human being and becoming that is inclusive, built for mutuality rather than domination; travelling on the path of dialogue between diverse knowledge systems.
Telehealth has evolved over the course of time with advances in technology and utilization by healthcare providers. Specific to the field of psychology, telepsychology is advantageous for clinical, supervisory, and training purposes. The nine profession-wide competencies (PWCs) required by the American Psychological Association (APA) Commission on Accreditation (CoA) for training in health service psychology (HSP) provide a foundation for efficacious psychological practice. Given the integration of telepsychology into clinical practice, it is essential to establish a structured framework for developmentally appropriate telepsychology training to assure competency for doctoral, intern, and post-doctoral residency trainees. The present study surveyed 20 training directors to obtain their preference between three proposed models to assess trainee’s competence in telepsychology at the doctoral, internship, and postdoctoral training level. Results supported a preference for integrating telepsychology within the current PWCs. Important next steps may include formation of an expert panel to assist in integrating telepsychology expectations for advance-level psychology trainees within the required PWCs for training programs.
Action-state orientation (ASO) refers to regulatory modes influencing intention initiation and goal pursuit. While ASO pertains to both dispositional and time- and context-sensitive states, extant research predominantly focuses on individual differences in ASO, leaving within-person dynamics and situational antecedents underexplored. Addressing this gap, the study explored task-related fluctuations in ASO (ASO-T) and its relationship with task-related affect and anticipated task difficulty. Both the pilot study (Nperson= 62,Nmeasurement= 248) and the main study (Nperson= 165,Nmeasurement= 660) employed a biweekly data collection. However, in the main study, the assessment of anticipated task difficulty and other measures was temporally separated. Results of the pilot study indicated that the measurement of ASO-T is a reliable and valid instrument and ASO-T displays substantial within-person variation. The main study findings showed that task-related negative affect, but not positive affect, mediates the relationship between anticipated task difficulty and two forms of ASO-T (hesitation and preoccupation). Additionally, task-related positive affect was more strongly related to ASO-T than task-related negative affect. These findings confirm ASO-T as a context-sensitive and malleable construct and extend the ASO research by shedding light on task-related, situational antecedents of ASO-T.
ObjectivesHigh prevalence of depression in young adults indicates the importance of finding effective treatments for this population. Mindful yoga has shown promise as a mood disorder intervention, but there remain gaps in the knowledge base, such as the mechanisms of action. These studies examined whether a short mindful yoga intervention led to greater reductions in depressed affect, compared to an active control group, and whether this effect was mediated by rumination and attentional bias.MethodIn Study 1, undergraduates (n= 71) received nine sessions of mindful yoga or relaxation. In Study 2, undergraduates (n= 74) selected for symptoms of depression followed the same procedure as Study 1.ResultsIn Study 1, results indicated no group differences on depressed affect at post-intervention or at 2-month follow-up. Post-hoc moderation analyses showed that for participants with greater depressed affect at baseline, mindful yoga was more effective in reducing depressed affect at post-intervention and 2-month follow-up. In Study 2, at 2-month follow-up, but not at post-intervention, mindful yoga led to greater reductions in depressed affect. Neither study showed mediation effects for rumination or attentional bias.ConclusionsThe results suggest mindful yoga may have promise for young adults with symptoms of depression.PreregistrationThis study was not preregistered.
Efficient and flexible responses are essential for successfully interacting with the environment. These interactions require an instantaneous integration of visual stimuli and responses, known as ‘stimulus–response binding’ (SR binding). SR binding is considered part of a holistic temporary representation, the event file, that integrates the stimulus, the response, and the action effect produced by this response. It is commonly assumed that an event file (or at least the SR binding) would end with the execution of the response or its action effect. This, however, has never been directly tested. Here, we tested whether the SR binding can be formed between another temporally close stimulus that people didn’t respond to by implementing a sequence of two stimuli where participants needed to respond only to the first or second stimulus. Our results indicate that a binding between the response and this temporally close stimulus can occur, but only when it’s placed after, and not before, the response execution. This finding suggests that the event file might operate a temporal binding window that is not decisively terminated by the response execution. Further, this insight into the temporal dynamics of the event file highlights the temporal flexibility of the SR binding and, thus, the need for careful consideration of its sub-structures and durability.
Time perspective is a concept that elucidates the manner in which individuals assess the present, past, and future. In the relevant literature, trauma and trauma-related issues have been matched to time perspective. In particular, there are conflicting findings regarding post-traumatic growth. The objective of the research is to investigate the mediator role of time perspective in the relationship between childhood traumas and post-traumatic growth. Based on this, it is predicted that early traumas and post-traumatic growth will be related to time perspective and proposed relationship will have important consequences for literature and clinicians. For this purpose, 676 participants were included, and the survey set was presented to the participants. Pearson correlation and mediation were performed. Results showed that there is a only significant relationship between emotional neglect and post-traumatic growth, while there is no relationship between the other sub-dimensions of childhood traumas and post-traumatic growth. As a result of the mediation analysis conducted, it was seen that time perspectives played a mediator role between emotional neglect and post-traumatic growth. The results obtained were discussed within the framework of the related literature and suggestions for future studies were presented.
When COVID-19 vaccines were publicly distributed, there was inaccurate information about their efficacy and safety. Why is it that some people came to believe claims that were not corroborated by evidence and held such misbeliefs? Based on the belief gap hypothesis, we expect partisan-based gaps in misbeliefs about COVID-19 vaccines to grow over time as a function of partisan news exposure. Data from a three-wave survey fielded shortly after the COVID-19 vaccine public rollout showed no change in misbeliefs by political identity. However, data showed three-way interaction effects, such that levels of misbeliefs decreased during the study period for respondents with right-leaning political identities as they were exposed to vaccine-related news in both conservative and liberal news outlets. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of findings.
Athletes at all levels experience setbacks to sport performance that hinder goals and impact motivation and wellbeing. In two randomized controlled trials, we tested the viability of athletes to learn from a cognitive-based Setback Solutions Intervention intended to enhance perceived control and behavioural strategy intentions, and lower indecision about setback management. Study 1 focused on testing the intervention feasibility, fidelity, and effectiveness of setback management for 81 postsecondary student-athletes in the USA and Canada (Mage= 22.69). ANCOVAs tested differences between conditions (treatment, control) for Time 2 (post-treatment) setback-related indecision, perceived control, and behavioural strategy intentions, controlling for Time 1 (baseline) levels of each outcome, and setback experience. Athletes in the treatment (vs. control) condition reported lower Time 2 indecision and greater perceived control over setback management. Study 2 tested pre-registered hypotheses for these effects in 201 postsecondary student-athletes from the USA and Canada (Mage= 23.54 years). Study 2 incorporated a six-week follow-up post-intervention (Time 3) and additional psychosocial wellbeing outcomes (e.g., rumination, likelihood to seek social support). The findings were consistent with Study 1 evidencing the effectiveness of the intervention to decrease indecision and increase perceived control over setback management. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the development and potential of the intervention for widespread delivery to student-athletes encountering adversity in sport.
To measure individuals’ generalized approach to group inequality, social dominance orientation (SDO) scale (i.e., SDO7; with two correlated dimensions of dominance and anti-egalitarianism) has been developed. However, its measurement invariance has not been tested yet, nor has it been extensively used in developing countries. Therefore, in the present study, we studied the factor structure of the eight-item SDO7scale-short form in India and tested its measurement invariance across groups on a sample of 734 college students (age,M= 20.3 years,SD= 3.48). The results show that, after controlling for the acquiescence response style and wording (method) biases, the theoretically consistent two-factor model was a better fit than the one-factor model. This best-fit model was strongly invariant across caste and gender and partially strongly invariant across religion. Moreover, consistent with social realities, Hindu, men, and higher caste (among Muslim) had higher SDO. Thus, the present study supports the cross cultural validity of SDO and partially establishes a reliable and valid Hindi version of SDO7scale-short form.
Diminished responding to one’s own name is one of the strongest and earliest predictors of autism. However, research on the neural correlates of this response in autism is scarce. Here we investigate neural responses to hearing the own name in school-aged children with and without autism. Thirty-four children with autism and 33 without autism (ages 7–13) were presented with three categories of names (own name, close other’s name and unknown other name) as task-irrelevant deviant stimuli in an auditory oddball paradigm, while EEG was recorded. In line with previous findings, parietal P3 amplitudes for the own name were enhanced compared with a close other’s name. Older children showed a stronger self-specific effect than younger children. However, this self-preferential effect was not different between groups, despite the fact that parents of children with autism reported significantly less own-name responsiveness in daily life. Neither the N1 component or SON negativity showed self-specific effects. In school-aged children, only the parietal P3 component, and not the N1 or SON negativity, appears to be enhanced for the own name as compared to a close other’s name. Age seems to have an effect on the own name modulation of the P3 amplitude, which may explain the relatively small overall effect size. Against expectations, groups did not differ on this self-specific effect. Further research into neural and behavioral responses to hearing one’s own name in autism, across different age groups, is warranted.
BackgroundCurrent research on the transmission of trauma and eating disorders across generations is limited. However, quantitative studies suggest that the influence of parents’ and grandparents’ eating disorders and their prior exposure to trauma are associated with the development of eating disorders in future generations. Qualitative research exploring personal accounts of the impact of transgenerational trauma on the development of eating disorders has been largely unexplored. The aim of the current qualitative study was to explore the meaning that participants ascribed to their eating disorders in the context of transgenerational trauma across three generations.MethodsSix adult female participants who had received a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa and/or bulimia nervosa completed multiple unstructured interviews, informed by a psychoanalytical methodology.ResultsFour themes were developed from the material that emerged from the interviews: (1)The toll of undigested emotions(2),A need for safety(3), “It’s not just me” – making connections with the past, and (4)“Last link” in the chain?ConclusionsThe themes were discussed in respect of previous literature, with a particular emphasis on Gerson’s concept of thedead third, which emphasises an unconscious compulsion to repeat unprocessed transgenerational traumas. Clinical implications of the research underscores the importance of a holistic approach to the treatment of eating disorders, recognising both individual and familial traumas within the family system. Moreover, the research demonstrates the significant impact that mental health clinicians can have in eating disorder treatment by fostering a supportive, safe and trusting therapeutic relationship.
ObjectivesIndividuals with autism often experience difficulties with executive functions (EF). Some of these EF are, in turn, associated with certain behavioural autism characteristics. This study explored the intra- and inter-individual variability between autistic children in each of the EF components. Furthermore, this study aimed to delineate subgroups of autistic children and adolescents with different EF profiles and examined whether these subgroups are distinguished by differences in autism characteristics.MethodsA sample comprised 58 autistic individuals and 47 non-autistic controls, aged between 8 and 18 years. Eight lab-based EF tasks were administered to measure EF domains: working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, generativity, and planning. Additionally, a parent-reported daily-life EF measure was used to assess how these abilities manifest in real-life contexts.ResultsA multiple case series analysis revealed that most autistic individuals performed similarly to the non-autism group on all lab-based EF tasks, and no autistic participant experienced difficulty with all EF measures. However, most individuals seemed to face a particular challenge in daily-life EF, as reported by parents. Furthermore, a cluster analysis was performed to delineate more homogenous subgroups with similar EF profiles within the autistic group. Three subgroups were identified and characterised by (1) challenges with internally controlled cognitive flexibility and planning, (2) challenges with internally and externally controlled cognitive flexibility and (3) no EF-related difficulties. These clusters did not differ in terms of social communication and interaction; however, they significantly differed regarding restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour and interests.ConclusionsDistinct subgroups within the autistic group with unique EF profiles (weaknesses and strengths) were identified providing insight into the specific patterns of difficulty crucial for tailor-made interventions.

Major life events, such as living through a pandemic, can have profound influences on development. The COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges to the ways in which parents lived their lives. Mothers’ workloads were magnified as they had to balance their own responsibilities and those of their children all within the confines of the home. Little is known about how mothers adapted over time and what they took away from the experience of living through this global crisis. The objective of the current study was to explore how life has changed for mothers three years after COVID-19 was designated a pandemic. Thirty mothers (Mage= 39) living in the Western United States participated in an interview between March and April 2023. Reflexive thematic analysis grounded within a hermeneutic phenomenological approach was used to analyze the transcripts. Four themes and one subtheme were identified around changes in perspective, family intimacy, gratitude, friendships, and coping tools. Mothers’ discussions highlighted both growth and challenges. They described increased feelings of family connectedness and agency, while also expressing negative shifts in their views on the goodness of humanity. The findings reveal that the pandemic had lasting impacts on mothers’ socioemotional and cognitive development, particularly in terms of relationships and worldviews. These effects are discussed within a context of a bioecological systems framework and life course theory. Insights from mothers’ lived experiences may provide valuable guidance for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and mental health practitioners, in developing interventions that can support mothers during and after crises.
Purpose: Autistic children have an increased likelihood of anxiety, but more research is needed on the characteristics that predict various types of anxiety in this population. Methods: In this study, we examined a range of child and family predictors of various types of anxiety using a sample of 452 autistic children from the Australian Autism Biobank. We used logistic regression to examine child and family predictors of four common types of anxiety in autistic children: generalised, phobic, separation, and social anxiety. Results: We found that 62.8% of children in this sample had symptoms of at least one type of anxiety. Poor quality sleep habits were the only predictive factor consistently identified across all anxiety symptom types. Specific to children with indicated generalised, separation, and phobic anxiety symptoms were the predictive factors of being older than five years, and specific to generalised and social anxiety were the predictive factors of higher cognitive abilities. Maternal anxiety was also a predictive factor in indicated children’s separation anxiety. Conclusion: These findings can help inform the provision of more targeted support for autistic people, particularly the interaction of poor sleep habits and anxiety symptoms.
The psychological resilience of teachers has gained significant attention due to its positive effects on schools and students. This cross-sectional quantitative study investigates the moderating roles of gender and the length of time spent with the school principal in the relationship between principals' empowering leadership behaviors and teachers' psychological resilience. Data were collected from 362 teachers working in public primary, secondary, and high schools in Siirt, Türkiye. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and moderation analysis using the bootstrapping method were applied to analyze the data. The findings reveal that the empowering leadership behaviors of school principals positively correlate with teachers' psychological resilience, with variations based on gender and time spent with the principal. Specifically, the relationship is stronger for female teachers compared to male teachers and for those who have spent more time with the school principal. These results offer theoretical insights and practical recommendations for enhancing teacher resilience through leadership practices, highlighting the importance of understanding contextual and demographic factors.
The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected those with caregiving responsibilities and its impacts continue. Through the fall of 2022, the circulation of RSV, influenza, and COVID-19 – a “tripledemic” – placed parents and caregivers in precarious situations with few COVID-19 supports available and less flexibility in work arrangements, potentially increasing family-to-work conflict (FWC). This mixed-methods study incorporates online survey data from the January 2023 Alberta Viewpoint Survey (N= 1196) and interview data collected from May-August 2023 (N= 23) to study the strategies families and caregivers used during the tripledemic to manage FWC in a time of high uncertainty. We find that parents, especially mothers, were most likely to miss work for extended periods, leading to a greater potential for FWC among these groups. Parents’ ability to manage FWC depended on the resources available to them, which were highly unequal. Those who were able to take advantage of workplace, relationship, and network resources were better able to limit FWC during these uncertain times. Findings contribute to larger understandings of family-to-work conflict by highlighting how parents attempt to manage uncertainty and the inequalities in available resources.
Despite enduring global efforts to reduce suicide incidence, over 700,000 people die by suicide annually, and rates remain near their all-time highs. Early detection of suicidal ideation (SI) provides the opportunity to intervene, although the speed of the suicide process and the aperiodic nature of self-harm screenings present major obstacles. In the U.S. and elsewhere, health inequities and sparse psychiatric services exacerbate these challenges. New approaches are needed to enable rapid risk stratification and connect individuals in crisis to the right level of care, regardless of when or where SI occurs. To that end, we investigated a location-agnostic, asynchronous approach to modelingcurrent SI riskusing affective and physiological self-reports ofN= 30,725 individuals. We implemented ecological momentary assessment (EMA) “trackers” within a digital behavioral health (dBH) platform between 1 May 2021 and 31 August 2023. These trackers elicited optional self-reports on sleep quality, stress, mood, and pain on an 11-point scale. We analyzed the resulting retrospective EMA dataset alongside participants’qualifying self-harm questionsfrom concurrent assessments (e.g., Patient Health Questionnaire-9). First, we conducted exploratory binomial tests and linear least squares regressions and found strong cursory associations between EMA tracker severity and SI risk. These tests motivated our hypothesis that EMA tracker data could significantly predict current SI risk in more rigorous analyses. Next, we used sequential logistic regression to control for the overrepresentation of trackers and/or assessmentsbetweenindividuals. Finally, we used multilevel logistic regression to control for the EMA tracker and assessment historywithinindividuals. Our analyses revealed significant associations between sleep, stress, mood trackers, and SI risk. Notably, mood emerged as a powerful SI predictor across multiple analyses. Our findings suggest that EMA trackers are well poised to integrate with tech-enabled suicide prevention frameworks to support low-latency, individualized care and improve health equity in underserved communities.
BackgroundAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) may result in significant medical sequelae. Compared to youth with eating disorders like anorexia nervosa (AN), youth with ARFID tend to be younger and are more likely to be male. We aim to describe sex differences in clinical characteristics of youth hospitalized for medical complications of ARFID and compare their characteristics with youth hospitalized for anorexia nervosa.MethodsThis is a retrospective review of electronic medical records for youth with ARFID (N= 36; 13 male and 23 female) and AN (N= 355; 40 male and 315 female), including restricting and binge-eating/purging subtypes, aged 9–25 admitted to the inpatient UCSF Eating Disorders Program (2012–2020).ResultsA greater proportion of youth with ARFID were male compared to youth with AN (36.1% vs. 11.2%). Male youth with ARFID (mean age 15.5 ± 2.8) had lower heart rate nadir (49.2 vs. 57.6 beats per minute,p= .019) and lower total cholesterol (129.8 vs. 159.3 mg/dL,p= .008), but higher hemoglobin (13.9 vs. 13.0 g/dL,p= .015) and prescribed calories at discharge (3323 vs. 2817 kcal,p= .001) compared to females with ARFID. Males with AN, who on average had higher admission BMI than males with ARFID (17.3 vs. 15.5 kg/m2,p= .013), required more (3785) kcal on discharge to restore medical stability than males with ARFID (3323 kcal). Compared to all youth with AN, youth with ARFID had lower body mass index (BMI, 15.7 vs. 17.0 kg/m2,p= .001) and lower vitamin D (26.5 vs. 33.0 ng/mL,p= .003).ConclusionsARFID in males is associated with lower heart rate nadirs than in females with ARFID. Clinicians should be aware of unique medical complications in youth with ARFID compared to youth with AN.
This article aims to reconceptualize the replication crisis as not merely a problem of flawed methods, lack of scientific rigor, or questionable researcher conduct, but as a fundamentally epistemological and philosophical issue. While improved methodologies and scientific practices are necessary, they must be considered through the lens of the underlying epistemologies. Toward this end, a new paradigm for psychological research and practice, grounded in second-order cybernetics and transactional causality, is proposed as instrumental. Second-order cybernetics, as introduced by Heinz von Foerster, challenges traditional scientific methodologies that assume a strict separation between the observer and the observed. The core idea is that the observer, through the very act of observing, inevitably becomes part of the system they study, leading to a shift from linear to transactional causality. This epistemological shift has profound implications for the research practice and the responsibility of the psychology practitioner. Foerster’s ethical imperative –act always so as to increase the number of choices– combined with the aesthetic imperative –If you desire to see,learn how to act– illuminates an alternative methodological landscape for the clinical practice. The replication crisis in psychology is examined in light of these theoretical shifts, allowing for a new constructive vision which integrates basic research with applied psychological practice. Second-order cybernetics encourages a participatory approach to research, emphasizing the catalyzing role of the observing practitioner. The article concludes by advocating for an epistemological superposition, where psychologists navigate multiple perspectives to enhance the integrity and applicability of their findings in the real world.
In 2021, the Welsh Government introduced new statutory guidance for schools titled ‘Framework Guidance on Embedding a Whole School Approach to Emotional and Mental Wellbeing’. This document outlined new responsibilities for educational settings to work towards incorporating a whole school approach, with regard to the Framework in action planning, service delivery and policy in relation to the mental and emotional wellbeing of learners and staff. While there is growing evidence to suggest that whole school approaches can be beneficial to social and emotional wellbeing for pupils, evidence on effective implementation is limited. This paper reports on findings from qualitative group interviews with staff in schools in Wales, conducted as part of a wider, mixed-methods evaluation of the Framework. It focuses on factors in the school context which impacted initial implementation. A number of school level factors were identified as barriers to implementation and staff engagement with the Framework. School staff reported higher levels of pupil mental health challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and an absence of capacity in in-house and external support services to address this. Poor staff wellbeing and significant workload pressures were also reported, driven in part by concurrent implementation of the new Curriculum For Wales. This led staff to feel ill-prepared for the more complex issues being faced, exacerbated by a lack of access to relevant training to be able to support pupil and colleague mental health. This paper concludes with recommendations for policy-makers to support Framework implementation.
IntroductionAttitudes of healthcare providers towards young people seeking sexual and reproductive health services (SRHS) are poorly described in research. Yet, this has implications for the promotion and operations of Youth Friendly Sexual and Reproductive Health Services (YFSRHS). This study seeks to identify and describe the overall treatments received by young people seeking SRHS.MethodA total of 31 qualitative sessions were conducted, comprising 20 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with healthcare providers and 11 focus group discussions (FGDs) with young people aged 15–24 years in Ebonyi state. The data were collected from December 2022 to March 2023. The analyses followed a coding reliability approach.ResultsFindings indicate that healthcare providers express both negative and positive attitudes when providing SRHS to young people. The attitude expressed is determined by the SRH sought and an intersection of social characteristics like age, gender, marital status and economic status. Thus, young unmarried persons may be reprimanded for seeking safe motherhood and newborn care, whereas young married persons are better received and treated positively. Young boys and girls experience negative treatment when seeking contraceptives but young girls are easily attended to when seeking information and counselling on SRH.ConclusionHealthcare providers’ attitude when dealing with young people seeking SRHS is influenced by multiple social dimensions, which reinforce discrimination and marginalisation.Policy ImplicationsPolicies that promote the provision of YFSRHS should consider the intersectional factors which trigger negative attitudes of healthcare providers that deliver these services.
This study investigated parental beliefs and experiences with cooperation among adults to overcome cyberbullying in Norwegian schools. Data comprised 17 semi-structured interviews conducted with parents of adolescents enrolled in primary or lower secondary schools in Norway. Reflexive thematic analysis revealed four themes: (1) individual and (2) organizational aspects influencing cooperation, (3) cyberbullying as a form of aggression, and (4) interactional dimensions of cooperation. These findings highlight the complexity of cyberbullying characteristics and mesosystemic cooperation, which require expertise in various fields. The viral and covert nature of cyberbullying requires adults to create spaces, online or offline, where children may safely report unwanted behaviors without the fear of retaliation. Any barriers to cooperation, such as language, lack of technological knowledge, and resource allocation, must be addressed. Immigrant parents contributed insights regarding barriers to cooperation due to cultural and linguistic differences. Attitudes, behaviors, and outcomes need to be addressed before cooperation based on trust, support, and realistic goals can be implemented.
BackgroundThere is a growing importance of loneliness measurement through valid and reliable instruments. However, to establish valid and reliable measures, there is a need to explore their psychometric properties in different research settings and language environments. For this reason, this study aimed to validate the Three Item Loneliness Scale (TILS) in the Czech Republic within a Slavonic language environment.MethodsA sample of Czech adults (n= 3236) was used consisting primarily of university students. We utilized Classical Test Theory to assess TILS internal consistency, temporal stability, and factor structure. Item Response Theory (IRT) was used to estimate Differential Item Functioning (DIF), the discrimination and difficulty of the TILS items and to estimate the measurement precision of the whole scale. Construct validity was explored through the Spearman correlation coefficient using personality traits, depression, and anxiety.ResultsThe results showed satisfactory reliability and validity of the TILS in the Czech Republic. The scale’s internal consistency and temporal stability were found to be satisfactory (Cronbach’sα= 0.81, McDonald’sω= 0.82, ICC = 0.71). The parallel analysis supported the unidimensionality of the TILS. The IRT results indicated that the highest measurement precision was reached in individuals with lower and above-average levels of loneliness. Significant correlations between the TILS scores, anxiety, depression, and personality traits supported the construct validity of the scale. Although the DIF analysis identified statistically significant differences in responses to items TILS_2 and TILS_3 based on education level and employment status (with no significant differences observed for TILS_1), the effect sizes of these differences were small. This indicates that, despite statistical significance, the practical impact on the scale’s validity across these groups is minimal.ConclusionsThe validated TILS provides a reliable and valid tool for assessing loneliness in the Czech Republic. Its brevity makes it a practical option for researchers and clinicians seeking to measure loneliness time-efficiently. Future studies should explore how adding new items could increase the measurement precision of the TILS.
Sighting dominance is an important behavioral property which has been difficult to measure quantitatively with high precision. We developed a measurement method that is grounded in a two-camera model that satisfies these aims. Using a simple alignment task, this method quantifies sighting ocular dominance during binocular viewing, identifying each eye’s relative contribution to binocular vision. The method involves placing a physical target between the viewer and a display. The viewer indicates the perceived target’s projection on the display with both eyes open and with only one eye open. The relative location of the binocular projection in relation to the two monocular projections is the index of dominance. The method produces a continuous variable with robust test–retest reliability (ICC = 0.96). The unit of measurement for the computed quantity is physiologically grounded: it is proportional to the distance between the monocular projections, which we show is predictable from interpupillary distance and phoria. Comparisons with the classic ‘hole in card’ sighting dominance test show good agreement, but also hint at potential bias for determining right-eye dominance in the latter. Interestingly, we find that some individuals systematically demonstrate nearly balanced vision, a phenomenon previously construed as mixed dominance or noisy responses. We also present ways to quantify and mitigate sources of random noise in this measurement. Overall, this new method allows for precise estimation of sighting dominance during binocular viewing. We expect it will allow a more effective understanding of the neural basis of dominance and improved effectiveness when using sighting dominance as a covariate in more complex analyses.
Recovery Colleges offer an innovative educational model focused on collaborative learning, emphasizing the lived experiences of individuals facing mental health challenges. The Recovery College Guetersloh-OWL (RC GT-OWL) exemplifies this approach, supporting and empowering participants through collective learning to enhance their mental well-being. This study aims to explore the subjective experiences and perceived value of participating in RC GT-OWL programs, with particular attention to their influence on students’ knowledge acquisition and individual recovery journeys. Forty-four students (N = 44) who engaged in RC GT-OWL courses participated in this study. Data collection involved an online survey informed by a modified version of the RECOLLECT Fidelity Measure, adapted and translated using Beaton et al.’s framework. Findings highlight RC GT-OWL’s role in fostering meaningful interpersonal relationships within and beyond the college setting. Participation was associated with personal growth, increased self-awareness, and significant contributions to students’ recovery processes. This study underscores the potential of recovery colleges to support mental health recovery through educational, peer-driven models. Continued research is recommended to further understand the mechanisms by which educational interventions, such as those implemented in recovery colleges, foster sustainable recovery and personal development.
Parental Reflective Functioning is considered a critical variable, both for the exercise of parenthood and for child development. For some years now, there has been a need for sufficiently sensitive and effective instruments to explore and evaluate Parental Reflective Functioning. This preliminary study presents the construction and validation of a short version of theParent Development Interview-Revised, which we callParent Development Interview-Brief.The main objective of this abbreviation is to maintain the semi-structured nature of the interview while decreasing the time needed to administer it. A multicenter and cross-sectional study with a normative sample of 60 mothers of children under five years of age with normotypical development is presented. To analyze the criterion validity of theParent Development Interview-Brief, participants completed theCuestionario de Apego Adulto [Adult Attachment Questionnaire]and theParenting Stress Index-Short Form.The psychometric qualities of the new instrument are discussed, as well as the need for sufficiently sensitive, reliable, and effective tools to tap Parental Reflective Functioning for use in clinical contexts and research.
The prevalence of autistic students in schools is continuously increasing. Typically, the social and sensory differences associated with autism can make the school environment difficult to manage. Autistic students are more likely to experience mental health difficulties than their non-autistic peers. It is therefore important to listen to autistic people about their educational experiences and explore ways that the environment could be changed to reduce anxiety.Purpose.The current research explores whether the relationship between school belonging and anxiety in secondary-aged autistic students is mediated by camouflaging.Methods.An anonymous online survey was completed by 72 autistic students attending mainstream schools in the UK and Ireland. The survey included questionnaires about school belonging (simple sense of belonging scale), anxiety (ASC-ASD) and camouflaging traits (CAT-Q). Further, the survey included open-ended questions about environmental factors related to school belonging and camouflaging. Qualitative content analysis was used to interpret answers to open ended questions.Results.The results found that, as predicted, camouflaging did mediate the relationship between school belonging and anxiety. Categories were created for each question, for example, ‘the school environment’ and ‘acceptance and understanding’.Conclusion. Social relationships; individual factors; the environment and adaptations, and acceptance and understanding, influence students’ sense of belonging.
BackgroundWhile recent studies suggest a high prevalence of Internet gaming disorder (IGD) in child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) clinics, little is known about the factors contributing to problematic gaming among these patients. Given the well-established role of parenting and parent-child relationships in the development of problem behaviors, this study aimed to explore parent-child relationships within a Swedish cohort of CAP patients with IGD.MethodsA total of 72 adolescents from CAP clinics in Skane, Sweden, diagnosed with IGD based on DSM-V criteria (73% boys), aged 13 to 18 years were included in the study. The adolescents completed the Game Addiction Scale for Adolescents (GASA) and reported on aspects of parent-child communication, such as parental control and adolescent disclosure and secrecy, and family climate. Adolescents were categorized as engaged, problem or addicted gamers based on core approach. Independent sample t-tests, Pearsons’s correlations, and multivariate regression analyses were used to address the study goals.ResultsIndependent sample t-tests revealed that girls showed lower levels of parental knowledge than boys. Bivariate correlation analyses showed that IGD-symptoms were related to lower levels of child disclosure, while multivariate regression analyses revealed that higher IGD-symptoms were predicted by high levels of child secrecy and low child disclosure.ConclusionParent-child relationships, in particular adolescent information management to parents, plays an important role for the level of IGD-symptoms in a clinical sample of adolescents. We suggest that therapeutic interventions for IGD should integrate family-focused strategies, such as parent training programs fostering open communication between parents and their children.
This study aims to validate the Portuguese version of the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.82) and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.86 for positive affect and 0.89 for negative affect) for people with disabilities and to examine the association between engaging in physical activity and affective responses, investigating the relationship with satisfaction with life. 143 Portuguese with disabilities filled in the Portuguese version of the scales. The findings endorsed the single factorial structure and reliability of the Satisfaction with Life Scale [χ2/df = 6.3, B-Sp= 0.487, TLI = 0.989, CFI = 0.995, SRMR = 0.0263, RMSEA = 0.043 (CI = 0, 0.130)]. For Positive and Negative Affect Scale, the results also confirmed the factorial structure and reliability [χ2/df = 1.871, B-Sp= 0.114, TLI = 0.891, CFI = 0.918, SRMR = 0.0778, RMSEA = 0.078 (CI = 0.048, 0.108)]. On the other hand, the structural model presented satisfactory fit to the data [χ2/df = 1.436, B-Sp= 0.269, TLI = 0.917, CFI = 0.930, SRMR = 0.0748, RMSEA = 0.055 (CI = 0.033, 0.075)]. Significant direct effects have been found, as has been theoretically proposed, namely: years of practice displayed a positive and significant association with positive affect; positive affect was positively associated with satisfaction with life (β = 0.073, CI = 0.020, 0.139;p= 0.031).
Professor Nicola Clayton is perhaps best known for her work on food-caching scrub jays. Her seminal 1998 paper, together with Anthony Dickinson, showed that scrub jays could remember what food they had cached, where and how long ago, suggesting memory ability that is ‘episodic-like’ in nature. Here, we present data from a previously unpublished study that sought to replicate and extend these findings. The results replicate previous findings and address potential alternative explanations for earlier results. We argue that the controlled behavioural analyses introduced in this study have the potential to add nuance to our understanding of memory in scrub jay cache retrieval, and to inspire new studies exploring this phenomenon, about which we still have so much to learn.
Auditory iconic words display a phonological profile that imitates their referents’ sounds. Traditionally, those words are thought to constitute a minor portion of the auditory lexicon. In this article, we challenge this assumption by assessing the pervasiveness of onomatopoeia in the English auditory vocabulary through a novel data-driven procedure. We embed spoken words and natural sounds into a shared auditory space through (a) a short-time Fourier transform, (b) a convolutional neural network trained to classify sounds, and (c) a network trained on speech recognition. Then, we employ the obtained vector representations to measure their objective auditory resemblance. These similarity indexes show that imitation is not limited to some circumscribed semantic categories, but instead can be considered as a widespread mechanism underlying the structure of the English auditory vocabulary. We finally empirically validate our similarity indexes as measures of iconicity against human judgments.
The multiple-baseline design is a predominant experimental design in applied behavior-analytic research. Despite its strengths, when baseline lengths are assigned a priori, it is possible that the independent variable may be implemented when baseline data are trending in the same direction that is anticipated for positive treatment outcomes, thus threatening experimental control. A partial solution to this problem is to modify the traditional multiple-baseline design and stagger baselines across more than one dimension (e.g., across both individuals and settings). The purpose of this article is to describe the historical underpinnings of this approach, to highlight more recent uses of the design, and to emphasize possible areas suitable for application.
ObjectivesMeditative practice and experience increase sensitivity to bodily sensations and improve emotional well-being, but their influence on emotional body sensations has not been directly examined. Therefore, we aimed to measure bodily representations of emotion and relate them to mindfulness-related traits and skills.MethodUsing a sample of both mindfulness-naïve participants and experienced meditators, we applied the bodily maps of emotion task to measure emotional body sensations and relate them to mindfulness, using a preregistered analysis plan. Based on previous research, emotional body sensations were analyzed in terms of their magnitude, detail, and clarity.ResultsWe found that mindfulness skills and experience with meditation are related to several aspects of emotional body sensations, including sensation from key organ systems (the heart and stomach), and the level of detail and clarity of body sensations. We found that interpersonally focused mindfulness skills (e.g., empathy, compassion) are related to emotional body sensations across the sample, while intrapersonally focused skills (e.g., body awareness) are related to emotional body sensations only in experienced meditators.ConclusionsOur results show that mindfulness skills and practice are associated with enriched bodily representations of emotion, providing new insights into how mindfulness may improve self-awareness and emotion regulation.PreregistrationThe study’s analyses were preregistered athttps://osf.io/uxcbk.
Mental health services and treatment are unfortunately subject to sociodemographic disparities. To address this issue, recent studies have begun to apply analytics methods—that is, artificial intelligence in general, machine learning and deep learning in particular—toward the identification of such disparities and, where possible, mitigation of bias within models used in mental health research. However, it is difficult to understand the scope and status of such research as it is spread across many journals and contexts of study. Here we conducted an analysis of articles in this area. We identified 40 articles from 2017 to July 2023 related to the use of analytics in the context of sociodemographic disparities in mental health. We find that prediction, clustering/grouping and fairness models were most often applied in the articles analyzed. A number of mental health-related sociodemographic disparities were identified in these articles, for example, associated with race/ethnicity, gender, age and socioeconomic status, but such findings were typically context dependent. Thus, we also provide suggestions in this Analysis on how to both enhance generalizability and embrace context-dependent findings, especially via the identification of heterogeneous treatment effects, model bias mitigation, use of generative artificial intelligence, incorporation of data from devices, and translation of findings into practice.
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly heritable and burdensome worldwide. Genome-wide association studies can provide new evidence regarding the etiology of AUD. We report a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study focusing on a narrow AUD phenotype, using novel statistical tools in a total sample of 1,041,450 individuals (102,079 cases; European, 75,583; African, 20,689 (mostly African American); Hispanic American, 3,449; East Asian, 2,254; South Asian, 104; descent). Cross-ancestry functional analyses were performed with European and African samples. Thirty-seven genome-wide significant loci (105 variants) were identified, of which seven were novel for AUD and six for other alcohol phenotypes. Loci were mapped to genes, which show altered expression in brain regions relevant for AUD (striatum, hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex) and encode potential drug targets (GABAergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons). African-specific analysis yielded a unique pattern of immune-related gene sets. Polygenic overlap and positive genetic correlations showed extensive shared genetic architecture between AUD and both mental and general medical phenotypes, suggesting that they are not only complications of alcohol use but also share genetic liability with AUD. Leveraging a cross-ancestry approach allowed identification of novel genetic loci for AUD and underscores the value of multi-ancestry genetic studies. These findings advance our understanding of AUD risk and clinically relevant comorbidities.
Purpose: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often show abnormal speech prosody. Tonal languages can pose more difficulties as speakers need to use acoustic cues to make lexical contrasts while encoding the focal function, but the acquisition of speech prosody of non-native languages, especially tonal languages has rarely been investigated. Methods: This study aims to fill in the aforementioned gap by studying prosodic focus-marking in Mandarin by native Cantonese-speaking children with ASD (n = 25), in comparison with their typically developing (TD) peers (n = 20) and native Mandarin-speaking children (n = 20). Natural prosodic marking of different types of focus was elicited by picture-based prompt questions, recorded and analyzed acoustically. Results: The autistic children made use of fewer acoustic cues and produced less evident on-focus expansion in these cues than TD, especially the native-Mandarin speaking peers. They also demonstrated a clear preference to on-focus expansion than to post-focus compression. These children, together with their native Cantonese-speaking peers, also hyper-performed in tone realization, prioritizing lexical prosody over focus marking. Such hyper-performance may further limit their use of prosodic cues in focus marking. However, the difficulties the autistic children faced in the acquisition of speech prosody in a non-native tone language, though found, are not more than those they face in their mother tongue. Conclusion: Multilingual exposure may help the autistic children master the use of some focus marking strategies though they still need interventions to help them to implement their focus-marking knowledge more sufficiently in both native and non-native languages.
The present study aims to investigate the impacts of father-child communication on the mental health of left-behind children (LBC), and the role of maternal migration and mother-child communication in this correlations. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Anhui, China, from April 2018 to March 2019. Among 5253 valid responses, 1599 LBC who self-reported that their fathers were migrants at the time of the survey were included in the present study. There are three major findings: first, maternal migration can negatively influence LBC’s father-child communication frequency and quality; second, both higher father-child communication frequency and quality can promote LBC’s mental health; third, mother-child communication can enhance the protective effects of father-child communication quality on LBC’s mental health. Thus, we propose that, to promote the mental health of children with both parents migrating, it is of great importance for mothers and fathers to realize that direct father-child communication matters. And more direct father-child communication should be encouraged for children with both parents migrating.
The degree of semantic equivalence of translation pairs is typically measured by asking bilinguals to rate the semantic similarity of them or comparing the number and meaning of dictionary entries. Such measures are subjective, labor-intensive, and unable to capture the fine-grained variation in the degree of semantic equivalence. Thompson et al. (inNature Human Behaviour,4(10), 1029–1038,2020) propose a computational method to quantify the extent to which translation equivalents are semantically aligned by measuring the contextual use across languages. Here, we refine this method to quantify semantic alignment of English–Chinese translation equivalents using word2vec based on the proposal that the degree of similarity between the contexts associated with a word and those of its multiple translations vary continuously. We validate our measure using semantic alignment from GloVe and fastText, and data from two behavioral datasets. The consistency of semantic alignment induced across different models confirms the robustness of our method. We demonstrate that semantic alignment not only reflects human semantic similarity judgment of translation equivalents but also captures bilinguals’ usage frequency of translations. We also show that our method is more cognitively plausible than Thompson et al.’s method. Furthermore, the correlations between semantic alignment and key psycholinguistic factors mirror those between human-rated semantic similarity and these variables, indicating that computed semantic alignment reflects the degree of semantic overlap of translation equivalents in the bilingual mental lexicon. We further provide the largest English–Chinese translation equivalent dataset to date, encompassing 50,088 translation pairs for 15,734 English words, their dominant Chinese translation equivalents, and their semantic alignmentRcvalues.
Jessel et al. (Behavior Analysis in Practice, 17, 727–745,2024) demonstrated that results from the performance-based, interview-informed synthesized contingency analysis (IISCA) had strong correspondence when compared to typical IISCA procedures and produced positive outcomes with resultant functional communication training procedures. On the basis of the assumption that functional analyses may include potentially adverse events insofar as they deliberately and repeatedly arrange conditions suspected to evoke dangerous behavior, Jessel and colleagues argued in favor of aligning functional analysis procedures with guidelines of trauma-informed care. We replicated and extended Jessel et al. (Behavior Analysis in Practice, 17, 727–745,2024) by conducting a performance-based IISCA with three children with autism referred for behavioral services due to dangerous behavior and by evaluating a comprehensive skill-based treatment informed by the performance-based IISCA. The skill-based treatment resulted in the eventual elimination of dangerous behavior and the acquisition of multiple important skills, with caregivers implementing treatment sessions for two of the three participants. Assessment and intervention procedures and outcomes were socially validated by all participating families.
This article addresses the problem of measurement invariance in psychometrics. In particular, its focus is on the invariance assumption of item parameters in a class of models known as Rasch models. It suggests a mixed-effects or random intercept model for binary data together with a conditional likelihood approach of both estimating and testing the effects of multiple covariates simultaneously. The procedure can also be viewed as a multivariate multiple regression analysis which can be applied in longitudinal designs to investigate effects of covariates over time or different experimental conditions. This work also derives four statistical tests based on asymptotic theory and a parameter-free test suitable in small sample size scenarios. Finally, it outlines generalizations for categorical data in more than two categories. All procedures are illustrated on real-data examples from behavioral research and on a hypothetical data example related to clinical research in a longitudinal design.
BackgroundThe need for educational institutions to create a conducive learning environment for participation of all students in school activities is one of the pillars advocated under Goal 4 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. While there are structures institutionalized to promote students’ well-being, universities are faced with a myriad of challenges which can negatively impact mental health and disrupt the overall learning experiences of students. This study explored the relationship between Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem which have been found to influence the mental health of students.MethodInformed by the cross-sectional design, one thousand and twenty (N= 1020) university students were recruited to self-report their Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem. The participants completed the Schutte Emotional Intelligence scale and the Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem scale. The data were validated using confirmatory factor analysis, means were computed, followed by multivariate analysis of variance and hierarchical multiple regression.ResultsThe study showed that participants were ambivalent on both EI and self-esteem. The hypothesized relationship between Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem was supported by the study findings. More so, demographic variables such as gender, religion and programme of study provided further insight into Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem of participants.ConclusionIn conclusion, the researchers of this study called on educators and university administrators to prioritize the Emotional Intelligence and Self-Esteem of students in mental health interventions. The need for partnership between administrators and religious leaders and other study implications, are discussed.
This research aimed to establish whether 12 weeks of bicycle-riding skills exercises with massed and distributed practice frequency at low and high intensity affect communication performance and stereotyped behavior among adolescent boys with autism. Fifty autistic boys aged 13.3 ± 1.32 years participated in the study. The participants were divided into homogeneous experimental groups (N= 10) with dissimilar training frequencies and intensities, along with a control group. Pre-tests using the GARS-2 test were administered to assess stereotyped behavior and communication skills, followed by post-tests and a one-month follow-up. Non-parametric Kruskal Wallis and ANCOVA results at a significance level of 0.05 showed that there was a significant difference in the post-test of stereotyped behavior and communication skills (p= 0.001 andp= 0.002, respectively) and follow-up test one month later (p= 0.003,p= 0.048, respectively) between the intervention and control groups after performing bike riding skills exercises with low and high intensities and frequencies (one and three sessions per week). Regardless of the intensity and frequency, bike riding skills training during the critical period of adolescence can significantly reduce stereotyped behaviors and enhance communication skills, which can also support positive development in other domains for individuals with autism.
IntroductionThe Big Five Inventory (BFI) is a popular measure that evaluates personality on the Big-Five model. Apart from its utilization across cultures, the literature did not reveal any meta-analysis for the reliability of the different versions of the BFI and its translations. The current study carried out a reliability generalization meta-analysis (REGEMA) to establish the reliability of the BFI across cultures and languages.MethodsWe searched 30 databases for the relevant studies from 1991 to mid-November 2024. The studies that we intended to include in our meta-analysis required to have utilized the BFI (44 items) and the BFI-2 (60 items) and have reported Cronbach's alpha or McDonald's omega reliability estimates. Our coded variables included BFI version, sample size, population type, age, gender, clinical state, and reliability. A total of 57 studies (datapoints) published in 34 research articles (involving 43,715 participants; 60.24% women; Mean age = 30.08) from various cultures and languages were finally included. These studies used BFI and BFI-2 in Arabic, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swahili, and Turkish. Data analysis was conducted using the metafor and meta packages in R. The average correlation was computed using a random-effects model and reliability coefficients indicated effect size. I2and Cochran's Q tests were used to examine heterogeneity, with prediction intervals suggesting genuine influences around the pooled estimate. Using funnel plots, regression-based tests (e.g., Egger's regression, rank correlation), and trim-and-fill imputation, publication bias was adjusted to estimate unbiased effects.ResultsWe calculated the individual and combined reliability of the BFI and BFI-2 across languages and cultures. The results revealed the reliability of all five factors used in the BFI/BFI-2. The BFI estimates provide the following results: openness is estimated at 0.77 (95% CI: 0.75; 0.80); conscientiousness is estimated at 0.80 (95% CI: 0.78; 0.82); extraversion is also estimated at 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79; 0.82); agreeableness is estimated at 0.73 (95% CI: 0.71; 0.76); and neuroticism is estimated at 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79; 0.82). The BFI-2 estimates are as follows: openness is estimated at 0.83 (95% CI: 0.82; 0.84); conscientiousness is estimated at 0.86 (95% CI: 0.85; 0.87); extraversion is estimated at 0.85 (95% CI: 0.84; 0.86); agreeableness is also estimated at 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79; 81); and neuroticism is estimated at 0.89 (95% CI: 0.88; 0.89).ConclusionThe current meta-analysis represents the first reliability analysis of the BFI and the first comparison between its two different versions, the BFI (44 items) and the BFI-2 (60 items). The generalized reliability of both the BFI and BFI-2 were established. The findings confirm that the BFI and BFI-2 have good reliability across all five factors.
Depression is among the most prevalent mental health issues affecting adolescents. Parents may play an important role in identifying warning signs of depression and providing support. However, little is known about how parents understand and respond to the early signs of adolescent depression, or their depression literacy (DL). The factors associated with their DL are also unclear. This questionnaire-based study aimed to explore DL in a sample of primary caregivers (n= 321,Mage= 46.2 years, 76% female) of 12–18-year-old adolescents living in the Republic of Ireland, through responses to a vignette depicting a character displaying symptoms of depression. Two-thirds (66.7%) attributed the character’s symptoms to depression, while 92.2% believed the character needed help. One third (34.6%) believed asking the adolescent about suicide would be harmful. Only parent empathy significantly predicted labelling the symptoms as ‘depression’. Contrary to hypotheses, there were no significant differences identified based on parents’ gender, their child’s gender, or their child’s age. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the link between empathy and DL in parents, and may inform targeted interventions to improve DL.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairments in social affective engagement. The present study uses a mild social stressor task to add to inconclusive past literature concerning differences in affective expressivity between autistic young adults and non-autistic individuals from the general population (GP). Young adults (mean age = 21.5) diagnosed with ASD (n= 18) and a non-autistic comparison group (n= 17) participated in the novel social stress task. Valence (positive/negative) and intensity of facial affect were coded across four observational episodes that alternated between engagement and disengagement of social conversational partner. Results indicated an overall attenuation in expressivity in the ASD group in comparison to the non-autistic group. Mean affect differed between groups, especially in the amount of affective expression. Both groups responded with increased positive expressions during social engagement episodes. The affect difference was driven by a smaller proportion of positive and a greater proportion of neutral affect displays in the ASD group compared to the non-autistic group during these episodes, and less so by negative affect differences. The results suggest that friendly, non-threatening social interactions should not be assumed to be aversive to autistic individuals, and that these individuals may respond to such situations with muted positive valence. These findings are consistent with past reports of decreased expressivity in autistic individuals compared to individuals from the general population, specifically in an ecologically valid social context.
The Beyond Reality Image Collection (BRIC) is a set of 648 photos, some painted by an artist and some generated by artificial intelligence. Unlike previous photosets, the BRIC focused on nonrealistic visuals. This collection includes abstract and non-abstract paintings and nonrealistic photographs depicting objects, scenes, animals, humans, and fantastical creatures with varying degrees of unreal elements. We collected evaluative ratings of the photos, using a convenience sample of 16,208 participants in a total of 25,321 sessions. We used multiple evaluation measures: binary positive/negative and like/dislike categorization, seven-point ratings on these attributes, both under no time pressure and under time pressure, and evaluative priming scores. The mean evaluation of the photos on the different measures was highly correlated, but some photos consistently elicited a discrepant evaluative reaction between the measures. The BRIC is a valuable resource for eliciting evaluative reactions and can contribute to research on evaluative processes and affective responses.
IntroductionSex workers overlap demographically with individuals who are pushed into informal economies due to their marginalized identities. Although policies increasing the criminalization of sex work are not regarded as hate politics, we argue that these policies are de facto hate policies against LGBTQ + communities and other marginalized groups.MethodsWe utilize a literature review of nine empirical studies (2018–2023) on the effects of SESTA/FOSTA, a sex worker hate policy, as well as 25 interviews from a 2022 community-based study on the effects of California Senate Bill 233 (SB233), which decriminalized condom possession.ResultsSESTA/FOSTA harmed sex workers by reducing their income, restricting access to safety and screening resources, increasing the risk of exploitation and violence, and removing online spaces for community building and political organizing. Moreover, marginalized sex workers felt these effects most keenly. The SB233 interviews further revealed that condom possession was utilized as a means for law enforcement to harass trans women through pervasive harassment, deadnaming, and forcing sexual encounters with the threat of violence and jail time.ConclusionsSESTA/FOSTA reveals how policies increasing the criminalization of sex workers also hate policies against marginalized groups. However, policies reducing the criminalization of sex workers, such as SB233, may be ineffective without community involvement. For this reason, we recommend community-based policies like SB357, which repealed loitering with intent.Policy ImplicationsHate politics increase carceral investments, leading to police harassment and surveillance of marginalized groups. We recommend community-led policy suggestions as an alternative.
The development of Chinese characters spans from the Han dynasty’s "Six Methods of Formation and Usage" to the contemporary "Three Methods," prompting scholars to explore Chinese character. This exploration reveals a typology that merges "truth" (veritas) and "conceptual thinking" (ratio) with "visual imagery" (Bildhaftigkeit, iconicity), highlighting the complex interplay between authenticity and conceptualization in character design. Chinese characters are formed through the human observation of worldly shapes, creating meaningful symbols through imaginative depiction. These symbols, mirroring the forms and sounds of various objects, enable the creation of new textual symbols with novel meanings. The character creation method from the traditional "Six Methods," has not been explored by previous studies. The aim of this paper was to examine ancient Chinese character symbolism, as seen in "Shuowen Jiezi," oracle bones, and bronze inscriptions, alongside bamboo and silk texts. It explored the relationship between cognitive linguistics and symbol visualization, analyzing both the explicit and implicit meanings of these symbols. By extending beyond established theories of character formation, the study probed into alternative creation method of Chinse characters. The distinct categories of characters were developed, including "using physical images to express objects" and "borrowing shapes to express things; focusing on shape/image to simulate terms" This approach highlights a variety of imagination are embedded within the character creation methods.
Whether it is listening to a piece of music, learning a new language, or solving a mathematical equation, people often acquire abstract notions in the sense of motifs and variables—manifested in musical themes, grammatical categories, or mathematical symbols. How do we create abstract representations of sequences? Are these abstract representations useful for memory recall? In addition to learning transition probabilities, chunking, and tracking ordinal positions, we propose that humans also use abstractions to arrive at efficient representations of sequences. We propose and study two abstraction categories: projectional motifs and variable motifs. Projectional motifs find a common theme underlying distinct sequence instances. Variable motifs contain symbols representing sequence entities that can change. In two sequence recall experiments, we train participants to remember sequences with projectional and variable motifs, respectively, and examine whether motif training benefits the recall of novel sequences sharing the same motif. Our result suggests that training projectional and variables motifs improve transfer recall accuracy, relative to control groups. We show that a model that chunks sequences in an abstract motif space may learn and transfer more efficiently, compared to models that learn chunks or associations on a superficial level. Our study suggests that humans construct efficient sequential memory representations according to the two types of abstraction we propose, and creating these abstractions benefits learning and out-of-distribution generalization. Our study paves the way for a deeper understanding of human abstraction learning and generalization.
IntroductionSex workers overlap demographically with individuals who are pushed into informal economies due to their marginalized identities. Although policies increasing the criminalization of sex work are not regarded as hate politics, we argue that these policies are de facto hate policies against LGBTQ + communities and other marginalized groups.MethodsWe utilize a literature review of nine empirical studies (2018–2023) on the effects of SESTA/FOSTA, a sex worker hate policy, as well as 25 interviews from a 2022 community-based study on the effects of California Senate Bill 233 (SB233), which decriminalized condom possession.ResultsSESTA/FOSTA harmed sex workers by reducing their income, restricting access to safety and screening resources, increasing the risk of exploitation and violence, and removing online spaces for community building and political organizing. Moreover, marginalized sex workers felt these effects most keenly. The SB233 interviews further revealed that condom possession was utilized as a means for law enforcement to harass trans women through pervasive harassment, deadnaming, and forcing sexual encounters with the threat of violence and jail time.ConclusionsSESTA/FOSTA reveals how policies increasing the criminalization of sex workers also hate policies against marginalized groups. However, policies reducing the criminalization of sex workers, such as SB233, may be ineffective without community involvement. For this reason, we recommend community-based policies like SB357, which repealed loitering with intent.Policy ImplicationsHate politics increase carceral investments, leading to police harassment and surveillance of marginalized groups. We recommend community-led policy suggestions as an alternative.
The Family First Prevention Services Act requires youth’s placement in residential care to be clinically appropriate, time-limited, and only when youth’s needs cannot be met in family-like settings in foster care. State child welfare agencies can benefit from upstream, empirical decision support to preempt youth’s placement disruption, coordinate proactive placement stabilization services, prevent unnecessary step-up to residential care, and improve outcomes for the youth. This statewide case study explores the potential benefit to child welfare decision support for placement stabilization and diversion from residential care, by comparing predictive machine learning (ML) models with conventional regression models. We analyzed child welfare spells of 12,621 youth in one large Midwestern state between January 2017 and January 2020. Caseworkers could refer youth to a placement stabilization and preservation program. To predict youth’s monthly program need in the next 6 months, we developed and validated a wide grid of ML models—random forest, regularized logistic regression, decision tree, dummy classifier—and a conventional unregularized logistic regression model, using literature-informed predictors from child welfare administrative data. We retrained, retested, and compared all models over time using temporal hold-out sets. Based on anticipated program capacity, model evaluation focused on accuracy in identifying the 100 highest-need youth, fairness, and equity of resource allocation. Random forest models produced the best performance with a precision (positive predictive value) 10 times greater than baseline precision. Common important predictors across models included youth’s age, history of placement changes, and emotional/behavioral needs. We discuss potential applications of ML to support preventive child welfare decisions, adapt to policy changes, and allocate limited resources.
Tests of Self-Conscious Affect (TOSCAs) are a group of scenario-based dispositional scales frequently used to measure individual differences in shame and guilt. The main aim of the present research was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Serbian version of TOSCA for adolescents (TOSCA-A) and to further explore the validity of guilt and shame measures. TOSCA-A was evaluated in three samples: 114 primary school students, 256 high-school students, and 365 college students. Several models were tested, but two-factor oblique solution had the best fit in all three groups. However, both shame and guilt demonstrated high internal consistency. Convergent validity of shame-proneness was also demonstrated by moderate correlations with self-esteem, perceived stress, and different affects. Results related to the measure of guilt were less consistent across age groups. Finally, we showed that guilt is a reliable measure of someone's motivation to make amends or apologize and someone’s feelings of remorse and regret - rather than feeling of guilt.
ObjectivesEquanimity is widely recognized as a fundamental component of change within mindfulness practice. The Equanimity Scale-16 (ES-16), which consists of two subscales—Experiential Acceptance and Non-reactivity—was designed to measure equanimity. However, the cross-cultural applicability of this scale has not yet been evaluated. The present study assessed the psychometric properties of the Equanimity Scale in the context of Eastern collectivist culture.MethodA total of 569 college students (371 females and 198 males) were recruited through two online data platforms. They completed the Equanimity Scale (ES-16) alongside several measures, including the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Nonattachment Scale, the Spiritual Index of Well-Being Scale, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and the Beck Depression Inventory-II. The exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted to examine the factorial validity of the ES-16, focusing on one-factor, two-factor, and bifactor models. Meanwhile, the reliability, convergent validity, and incremental validity were examined through correlation analyses and hierarchical regression analyses.ResultsSix items (1, 4, 7, 9, 10, and 11) in the original scale with 16 items were removed for lower communalities (< 0.30), lower cross-load difference (< 0.15), or the smaller number of factor items (< 2) in the Chinese context. The remaining 10 items did not support the two-factor model; instead, they indicated support for the bifactor model, which provided the best fit. The Equanimity Scale-10 (ES-10) demonstrated good convergent validity, discriminant validity, construct reliability, and predictive validity within the Chinese cultural context. However, it explained for only 41.89% of the total variance.ConclusionsThe ES-10 is a valid and reliable self-report measure for assessing equanimity within a bifactor model in the Chinese context. However, the variance explained for ES-16 and ES-10 is relatively low, with none exceeding 50%. Additionally, there are significant conceptual differences between these measures and the non-reactivity factor of the FFMQ. Consequently, it is recommended to develop an assessment tool with improved content validity and structural validity to better capture the construct of equanimity.
Pedestrian attitude is an important issue in road safety. In order to understand pedestrian attitudes, it is necessary to study their sociodemographic and psychological characteristics. With respect to this, the aim of the study was to examine age and sex differences in impulsive behavior and the role of impulsive behavior on pedestrian attitudes in Türkiye. A total of 347 Turkish pedestrians (145 male, 202 female) completed the Pedestrian Attitude Questionnaire (PAQ), the Urgency Premeditation Perseverance Sensation Seeking (UPPS) Impulsive Behavior Scale, and a Questionnaire Form. First, the psychometric structure of the PAQ was found to support the original structure, addressing attitudes towards other road users and attitudes towards traffic rules. With increasing age, negative attitudes towards traffic rules decreased. Female pedestrians also showed more negative attitudes towards other road users. The results of hierarchical regression analyses indicate that impulsive behavior is significantly associated with pedestrian attitudes depending on sociodemographic factors. The findings suggest that pedestrians’ impulsive behavior may influence their attitudes in traffic, but this influence varies by age and sex. The outcomes have important implications for intervention studies and road safety.
This study examines the transformative impact of a 6-week mindfulness-based training program on managers within the framework of humanistic management principles. Implemented as a randomized controlled trial (RCT), the research involved 97 managers from the R&D department of a technology development company in Turkiye. Participants were allocated to either an intervention group (N= 47) or a waitlist control group (N= 50), with assessments conducted at three time points: pre-test, post-test, and a 16-week follow-up. The findings reveal significant improvements in empathy, mindfulness, and wisdom among managers who completed the program, compared to those who did not. While the impact on inclusive leadership was less pronounced, the results indicate potential benefits for organizational culture as a whole. This study provides empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions in fostering key elements of humanistic management—such as empathy, mindfulness, and wisdom—and underscores their broader implications for cultivating a more humanistically oriented workplace.
In the literature about bullying prevention and intervention, still little is known about teacher and school characteristics possibly affecting an implementation of a whole-school approach anti-bullying programme. This study investigates the relations of teachers’ anti-bullying components at classroom and individual levels with teachers’ sociodemographics (gender, age, work experience and teaching in primary vs lower and upper secondary school) and school features (size, and duration of working with a whole-school approach anti-bullying programme). Teachers (n= 1576) in 99 Lithuanian schools implementing the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program answered a standardised online self-administered questionnaire. Through an Exploratory Factor Analysis (Principal Axis Factoring extraction method), we individuated a model of teachers’ implementation of anti-bullying components, consisting of three dimensions: classroom management, tutorship (organisation of class meetings and work with parents) and direct intervention into bullying incidents. In multilevel analyses, significant associations emerged between the three dimensions, teacher socio-demographics and school characteristics. Female teachers put more effort than male teachers into classroom management, tutorship and intervention into bullying incidents. Younger teachers put more effort than older teachers into all the three dimensions. Primary school teachers put more effort into classroom management and tutorship dimensions. Teachers with more working experience put more effort into intervening into bullying incidents. Lastly, teachers from certified Olweus schools with a longer duration of implementing the OBBP put more effort into direct intervention into bullying incidents. These results shed light on relevant characteristics affecting teachers’ efforts within anti-bullying components that need to be considered when implementing interventions.
The human papillomavirus (HPV) causes health problems, including but not limited to cancers of the cervix, penis, anus, and oropharynx. HPV vaccines are recommended to significantly reduce the prevalence and incidence of these health problems in males and females. Resource-limited countries, including Nigeria, experience high burdens of HPV-associated diseases. However, certain barriers within the health system may prevent the Nigerian general public who are eligible for vaccination from accessing the vaccines, and this area of research is underexplored in the country. Employing the World Health Organization’s framework of health system building blocks, the authors investigate this problem. The study involved a convenient sample of 40 participants (27 females and 13 males). Data were collected using an online survey comprising three sections, and thematic analysis was performed on the main data. Findings uncover factors in the six health system building blocks that serve as barriers to accessing the vaccines. These include the long waiting time generally experienced by patients in health facilities, insufficient awareness campaigns about the vaccination services, limited access to the vaccination services in rural and underserved areas, shaming from health care providers to patients who want to receive the vaccines, the lack of knowledgeable health care providers to educate the general public about the vaccines, shortage of human resources for health, cultural insensitivity among health care providers, inadequate assessment of patients’ HPV vaccination status by health care providers, and inefficient tracking of vaccine stocks. The factors also include the lack of technology for the vaccine production, improper storage of the vaccines in health facilities, insufficient government budgetary allocation for procurement of the vaccines, scarcity of health insurance with coverage of the vaccine cost, poor political will to improve the vaccination access, bad leadership in the country’s health system resulting in public doubt about the vaccines and health facilities administering them, absence of motorable roads for the public to access the vaccines in health facilities within rural settings, and coordination challenges in the vaccination programmes arising from shared management of the vaccination programmes among multiple government agencies or departments. Although the study provides comprehensive country-specific information on health system barriers to accessing HPV vaccines in Nigeria, its findings may also be relevant to other resource-limited countries with inefficient health systems. Improvements in health service delivery, human resources for health, health system financing, infrastructure, and leadership and governance are recommended to strengthen access to HPV vaccines and eliminate the health problems caused by HPV.
Resonance frequency (RF) is characterized as the specific frequency at which a system, equipped with delayed self-correction or negative feedback mechanisms, exhibits maximal amplitude oscillations in response to an external stimulus of a particular frequency. Emerging evidence suggests that the cardiovascular system has an inherent RF, and that breathing at this frequency can markedly enhance health and cardiovascular function. However, the efficacy of resonance frequency breathing (RFB) and the specific responses of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems during RFB remain unclear. In this study, we recruited 27 healthy young male subjects (aged 20–30 years) and used the corrected sliding method to accurately determine each subject’s RF. We then investigated cardiovascular activity, cardiorespiratory coupling, and the brain-cardiovascular network to clarify the effects and mechanisms associated with RFB. Our results indicate that: (a) the corrected sliding method can precisely evaluate RF; (b) the reduction in blood pressure is unique to RFB and not observed in other slow-paced breathing patterns (RF + 1 and 6 breaths per minute), which we attribute to the α-wave and parasympathetic-BRS pathway; (c) during slow-paced breathing, cardiorespiratory coupling predominantly favors the respiration-to-heart direction, with the RF stage eliciting the most significant response, while brain-cardiopulmonary information transfer increases across all tasks. These findings offer valuable insights into the impact of RFB on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems, potentially laying the groundwork for future research to optimize respiratory training protocols and improve health outcomes.
ObjectivesNumerous studies have focused on the ways to cultivate self-compassion (SC). Most of the SC interventions were typically lengthy and did not capture momentary fluctuations in SC after each exercise in the intervention. Therefore, we explored the impact of repeated self-compassionate writing as an ecological momentary intervention (EMI).MethodSeventy-five participants completed a 3-week study with signals sent twice daily, resulting in 1,980 observations collected. During the 1-week control period, participants were asked to report their experiences of negative events, momentary SC, and momentary stress. In the subsequent 1-week intervention period, they engaged in SC writing whenever they experienced negative events. Trait SC and weekly stress were also evaluated before and after the intervention, including a 1-week follow-up period.ResultsMultilevel modeling showed a slight significant increase in momentary SC and a reduction in momentary stress. However, the slope did not differ significantly between the intervention and control periods. Moreover, there were no significant changes in trait SC nor in weekly stress, although the weekly stress levels showed a decreasing trend with a small effect size from pre to post intervention.ConclusionsThis study provided preliminary evidence of the feasibility and utility of EMI in cultivating SC using repeated self-compassionate writing. Although the effect sizes were small, the study highlighted possible approaches to increase the effectiveness of the intervention.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.
Hispanic women in the United States have been identified as an ethnic group experiencing disproportionately higher mortality rates of breast cancer. These higher rates have been linked to contextual factors that delay breast cancer screening utilization. The COVID-19 pandemic posed a significant disruption to obtaining breast cancer screening affecting utilization of these services especially among minorities. Our cross-sectional study utilized the socio-ecological model (SEM) as a framework to identify barriers influencing delayed utilization using a comprehensive self-administered survey, which was completed among 155 Hispanic and 147 non-Hispanic White women, aged 50 and older, and who resided in the state of New Jersey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cancer screening attitudes and the extent in which numerous barriers affected utilization of breast cancer screening services during the pandemic were assessed using logistic regression and factor analysis. The analysis confirmed barriers that included low socio-economic status, lack of health insurance, low education attainment, unemployment, limited access to health care services, cancer fatalism, fear of acquiring COVID-19, and linguistic barriers. The findings of this study validate the recommendation of using multi-pronged interventions based on the SEM framework to address both individual and systemic barriers to screening. Breast cancer screening education, resources to access health services and health insurance options may be applied to these vulnerable populations to reduce barriers and facilitate yearly breast cancer screening.
The current cross-sectional study aims to examine whether spiritual wellbeing mediates between childhood psychological maltreatment and stress-related growth in emerging adults. We also aim to investigate the moderating role of responsibility on the mediating effect of spiritual wellbeing between childhood maltreatment and stress-related growth. The sample of the study consisted of 501 undergraduate emerging adults from different public universities in Türkiye, with 66.5% of whom were female and aged between 18 and 25 years. Results showed that childhood psychological maltreatment had significant associations with responsibility, spiritual wellbeing, and growth. Additionally, spiritual wellbeing acted as a mediator between childhood maltreatment and stress-related growth in emerging adults. Further, the results indicated that responsibility moderated the mediating effect of spiritual wellbeing on the link between psychological maltreatment and stress-related growth. The study results underscore the mediating role of the spiritual wellbeing in the association between childhood maltreatment and stress-related growth and the protective role of a sense of responsibility in this mediating model. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of spiritual wellbeing and responsibility in promoting positive outcomes in emerging adults, particularly in the face of adverse childhood experiences.
Much of the current autism and gender literature has been based within a medical deficiency model; where both are seen as deficiencies rather than differences. However, there is currently minimal knowledge about the experiences of being an autistic adolescent who is both assigned female at birth and has gender dysphoria (GD), whilst even less is known about their experiences of social identity, self-concept and resilience. This study aims to explore experiences of GD with a particular focus on identity and resilience to promote parent and healthcare staff understanding; particularly around gender-affirming care, to foster positive mental health outcomes. Five assigned female at birth autistic adolescents, who identify as trans men/boys, took part in one-to-one semi-structured interviews, which were analysed using an Interpretative Phenomenological Approach. Five subordinate themes arose;“Having both autism and GD”,“Finding where I belong”,“Being more than labels”,“Trying to cope”and“Making support successful”. Our findings build on current literature and theory regarding the experience of concurrent autism and GD; highlighting its legitimacy, the ways in which autism impacts upon GD and how healthcare approaches and policy can increase accessibility and suitability of gender-affirming care.
IntroductionIntimate partner violence (IPV) is a widespread social and health problem disproportionately burdening women and, we are learning, gender and sexual minority (GSM) people, who are under-represented in research. The measurement and reporting of gender and sexual orientation in health and social science research are also inadequate.MethodsWe conducted a focused mapping review and synthesis to examine the inclusion of GSM people, and the reporting of gender identity and sexual orientation, in Canadian IPV research. Using database searches, hand-searches (November 2022), and citation chaining (April/May 2023), we identified eligible articles that (1) were published in English or French in peer-reviewed journals from 2020 to 2022, (2) reported research involving at least some Canadian IPV survivors and/or perpetrators, and (3) had at least one Canada-affiliated author.ResultsThe 150 included articles contribute significantly to the IPV literature but have shortcomings. Most articles inadequately reported gender identity and sexual orientation; among articles reporting, most only included cisgender heterosexual participants. Some articles conflated sex and gender, used outdated terminology, or used language that invisibilized GSM people.ConclusionsWhile research focused on heterosexual women (and men) is needed, exclusionary research practices can further marginalize GSM people.Policy ImplicationsGiven such research practices can impede the development of equity-oriented policies for these groups, we provide recommendations for researchers to improve inclusion and reporting. Gatekeepers such as ethics review board members and funders should strive to uphold these standards, including developing their own research and reporting policies.
BackgroundThe influence of eye contact on memory has been a topic of extensive study, yet its effects remain ambiguous. This inconsistency may be attributed to the varying levels of task difficulty encountered when conducting this type of research.MethodsTo explore this possibility, our study used a word memory task that also integrated eye gaze as a means of examining how task difficulty (easy or difficult) modulates the effect of eye contact on word memory. A total of 41 participants engaged in the memory task under varying eye contact conditions.ResultsOur findings revealed a significant interaction between task difficulty and eye contact: For easy tasks, memory accuracy was lower with eye contact, whereas for difficult tasks, accuracy was improved with eye contact. Intriguingly, this effect was predominantly observed in female participants. In easy tasks, eye contact appeared to hinder memory performance in females, whereas it enhanced performance in difficult tasks.ConclusionsThese results suggest that the impact of eye contact on memory is not uniformly positive or negative, but is instead contingent on task complexity and influenced by gender differences. This study contributes new insights into the fluctuating effects of eye contact on memory, thereby enriching our understanding of the relationship between nonverbal social cues and cognitive processes.
This study aims to shed light on the influence of insecure attachment representations on the presence of emerging borderline personality features (EBPF) in school-age children, and the role of these features in manifestations of behavioral dysregulation. The sample is composed of 116 children aged 7 to 12 (Mage= 9.11;SD= 1.68; 47 girls) drawn from three groups: children under youth protective care (n= 35), consulting psychologists or child psychiatrists (n= 42), and the general population (n= 39). The EBPF were evaluated using the Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children. Attachment representations were assessed using the Child Attachment Interview. The Child Behavior Checklist for youth was used to verify the presence of behavioral dysregulation. Analyses of variance indicate that the three groups differ in the insecurity of attachment representations and the extent of behavioral dysregulation, with children under youth protective care showing the highest levels and children in the general population showing the lowest. Children under youth protective care have a higher EBPF score than the general population. Regression analyses confirmed that more insecure attachment representations predict an increase in EBPF, while the latter influence the increase in behavioral dysregulation. A partial mediating effect of EBPF was found in the relationship between attachment representations and behavioral dysregulation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify a mediation trajectory between attachment representations, EBPF, and behavioral dysregulation in a sample of school-age children. These results are discussed with regard to their implications for borderline-to-be functioning.
Parental bonding is defined as the affectionate tie a parent feels towards their infant. These feelings generally arise prenatally and increase in intensity over the course of pregnancy, both in mothers and in fathers. Bonding is fundamental for positive parenting behaviors and optimal child development. Few quantitative studies systematically examined what factors contribute to optimal bonding in fathers during pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to examine whether a variety of risk factors (symptoms of depression and anxiety, stress, and repetitive negative thinking) and resilience factors (self-compassion and trait mindfulness facets) were associated with prenatal paternal bonding and to explore potential mechanisms. In total, 66 expectant fathers with an average age of 33.7 years completed online questionnaires during the second or third trimester of pregnancy to assess the variables of interest. Analyses demonstrated that more symptoms of depression and anxiety and elevated levels of stress were associated with poorer bonding. In addition, less repetitive negative thinking, and more self-compassion and non-judging of inner experience were indirectly related to higher levels of paternal bonding through lower levels of stress. Findings suggest that expectant fathers who suffer from psychological distress, have more repetitive, negative, or intrusive thoughts, and tend to be more judgmental and self-critical may be at risk for suboptimal prenatal bonding. Providing adequate support for fathers at risk, perhaps in the form of mindfulness-based interventions, may be essential in order to cope with the challenges of new fatherhood and facilitate the process of bonding with the unborn child.
Having a detailed description of the psycholinguistic properties of a language is essential for conducting well-controlled language experiments. However, there is a paucity of databases for some languages and regional varieties, including Québec French. The SyllabO+ corpus was created to provide a complete phonological and syllabic analysis of a corpus of spoken Québec French. In the present study, the corpus was expanded with 41 additional speakers, bringing the total to 225. The analysis was also expanded to include three new databases: unique words, lemmas, and morphemes (inflectional, derivational, and compounds). Next, the internal structure of unique words was analyzed to identify roots, inflectional markers, and affixes, as well as the components of compounds. Additionally, a group of 441 speakers of Québec French provided semantic transparency ratings for 3764 derived words. Results from the semantic transparency judgment study show broad inter-individual variability for words of medium transparency. No influence of sociodemographic variables was found. Transparency ratings are coherent with studies showing the greater transparency of suffixed words compared to prefixed words. Results for participants who speak French as a second language support the association between second-language proficiency and morphological processing.
People with social anxiety disorder tend to interpret ambiguous social information in a negative rather than positive manner. Such interpretation biases may cause and maintain anxiety symptoms. However, there is considerable variability in the observed effects across studies, with some not finding a relationship between interpretation biases and social anxiety. Poor psychometric properties of interpretation bias measures may explain such inconsistent findings. We evaluated the internal consistency, test–retest reliability, convergent validity, and concurrent validity of four interpretation bias measures, ranging from more implicit and automatic to more explicit and reflective: the probe scenario task, the recognition task, the scrambled sentences task, and the interpretation and judgmental bias questionnaire. Young adults (N= 94) completed interpretation bias measures in two sessions separated by one week. Psychometric properties were poor for the probe scenario and not acceptable for the recognition task. The reliability of the scrambled sentences task and the interpretation and judgmental bias questionnaire was good, and they correlated highly with social anxiety and each other, supporting their concurrent and convergent validity. However, there are methodological challenges that should be considered when measuring interpretation biases, even if psychometric indices suggest high measurement validity. We also discuss likely reasons for poor psychometric properties of some tasks and suggest potential solutions to improve the assessment of implicit and automatic biases in social anxiety in future research.
In recent years, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques in research on the prediction of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has increased. However, concerns regarding the clinical relevance and generalizability of ML findings hamper their implementation by clinicians and researchers. Here in this systematic review we examined (1) the extent to which pre-, peri- and post-traumatic risk factors identified using ML approaches coincide with the theoretical understanding of the disorder; (2) whether new insights were gained through ML techniques; and (3) whether ML findings, combined with previous research, enable an integrative model of PTSD risk encompassing both predictor categories and their theoretical relevance. We reviewed ML studies on PTSD risk factors in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Studies were included if they specified when predictors and PTSD symptoms were collected in temporal relation to the traumatic event. A total of 30 studies with 12,908 participants (mean age 36.5 years) were included. After extracting the 15 most important predictors from all studies, we categorized them into pre-, peri- and post-trauma exposure predictors and examined their associations with established theoretical models of PTSD. Many studies exhibited a risk of bias, assessed using the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST). However, we found overlaps in identified predictors across studies, a concordance between data-driven results and theory-driven research, and underexplored predictors identified through ML. We propose an integrative model of PTSD risk that incorporates both data-driven and theory-driven findings and discuss future directions. We emphasize the importance of standards on how to apply and report ML approaches for mental health.
Process-based consent conceives of sexual consent as a process whereby individuals are continuously considering and have concern for their sexual partner’s willingness to continue engaging in sexual behavior without coercion. The current study used cross-sectional survey data and hierarchical linear regression to examine the independent and interactive effects of sex-related alcohol use attitudes, hostility toward women, and peer support for abuse on college men’s process-based consent (N= 463;Mage = 19; 93% heterosexual; 64% White, non-Hispanic). Findings revealed significant main effects of all three primary study variables on process-based consent beliefs and behaviors while controlling for fraternity membership, relationship status, and sexual history. A significant three-way interaction indicated that permissive sex-related alcohol use attitudes may inhibit process-based consent among college men with higher levels of hostility toward women who also believe their peers hold rape-supportive attitudes. These findings indicate that education around consent is necessary but may not be sufficient for preventing sexual violence. Interventions developed with and delivered by peer leaders that challenge harmful peer group norms about sex-related alcohol use and the mistreatment of women may create a social environment with more favorable conditions for changing individual college men’s beliefs and behaviors.
Premature reproductive aging is linked to heightened stress sensitivity and psychological maladjustment across the life course. However, the brain dynamics underlying this relationship are poorly understood. Here, to address this issue, we analyzed multimodal data from female participants in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (longitudinal,N= 441; aged 9–12 years) and Human Connectome-Aging (cross-sectional,N= 130; aged 36–60 years) studies. Age-specific intrinsic functional brain network dynamics mediated the link between reproductive aging and perceptions of greater interpersonal adversity. The adolescent profile overlapped areas of greater glutamatergic and dopaminergic receptor density, and the middle-aged profile was concentrated in visual, attentional and default mode networks. The two profiles showed opposite relationships with patterns of functional neural network variability and cortical atrophy observed in psychosis versus major depressive disorder. Our findings underscore the divergent patterns of brain aging linked to reproductive maturation versus senescence, which may explain developmentally specific vulnerabilities to distinct disorders.
Previous research has consistently demonstrated that emotional abuse is a robust predictor of adolescent suicidal ideation. However, few studies have explored the bidirectional relation between changes in emotional abuse and suicidal ideation at the within-person level, as well as the underlying mediating mechanisms. This longitudinal study examined the reciprocal relations between emotional abuse and suicidal ideation, along with the potential mediating role of self-disgust, by disentangling between- and within-person effects. A total of 4731 students (44.9% girls; Mage = 10.91 years, SD = 0.72) participated in a four-wave longitudinal study with 6-month intervals. Results from random intercept cross-lagged panel modeling indicated significant positive associations between emotional abuse, self-disgust, and suicidal ideation at the between-person level. At the within-person level, findings revealed that emotional abuse directly predicted suicidal ideation, and suicidal ideation also directly predicted emotional abuse. Emotional abuse also indirectly predicted suicidal ideation via self-disgust, while suicidal ideation indirectly predicted emotional abuse through self-disgust. These findings emphasize self-disgust as a central psychological mechanism in the bidirectional relations between emotional abuse and suicidal ideation. Targeted interventions reducing self-disgust and fostering a healthier self-concept could be crucial in breaking this harmful cycle, ultimately protecting adolescents from escalating emotional abuse and suicidal thoughts.
The fact that mental health has a major impact on individuals’ lives increases the importance of evaluating mental well-being. This longitudinal study investigated interaction between emotional reactivity, intolerance of uncertainty, and mental well-being among Turkish adults. Drawing on a sample of 199 participants, the research utilized measures to assess emotional responses, intolerance of uncertainty, and mental well-being. The findings indicated that emotional reactivity has a significant positive effect on intolerance of uncertainty, suggesting that heightened emotional reactivity is associated with an increase in intolerance of uncertainty. Moreover, intolerance of uncertainty demonstrated a significant negative impact on mental well-being, highlighting its role as a predictor of mental health outcomes. Importantly, intolerance of uncertainty fully mediated in the relationship between emotional reactivity and mental well-being. The study contributed to the literature by employing a longitudinal design, shedding light on the dynamic interactions between emotional processes, intolerance of uncertainty, and mental well-being. The findings emphasized the importance of considering intolerance of uncertainty as a key factor in understanding mental health outcomes and suggested avenues for future research to explore these relationships further.
The Multicultural Ideology Scale has been revised (MCI-r) and its psychometric properties are tested across different socio-political contexts. The MCI-r is comprised of six domains: Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social Interaction, Essentialistic Boundaries, Extent of Differences, and Consequences of Diversity. This study is a part of a larger international research project, examining the validity of the MCI-r in Canada. The results of our study supported a six-factor model for the MCI-r. However, we suggest removing Essentialistic Boundaries and Extent of Differences as they do not align with multicultural ideology and affect the interpretation and application of the model. Further analyses confirmed discriminant validity for the majority of the subscales; however, ideal convergent validity was not reached for all the subscales but one (Equity/Inclusion). Sufficient reliability was established for all the subscales. The examination of the association of the six components of the MCI-r with tolerance, intergroup contact, attitudes toward different ethnocultural groups, and intercultural ideology revealed that the four subscales of Cultural Maintenance, Equity/Inclusion, Social Interaction, and Consequences of Diversity were positively related to these variables. However, the association of Essentialistic Boundaries and Extent of Differences with tolerance was negative. We further found a negative relationship between the Essentialistic Boundaries dimension and interculturalism ideology. These results further support the argument that Essentialistic Boundaries and Extent of Differences may promote fixed, essentialist views of cultural groups that contrast with the flexible, inclusive nature inherent to the principles of multiculturalism.
Educators play a pivotal role in shaping the minds of future generations, fostering their growth and development into valuable societal assets. This study investigated the relationships between progressive personality, self-transcendence, and eudaimonic well-being in qualified teachers, with meaning in life as a potential mediator. Employing a descriptive-correlational design, the study targeted all qualified teachers within Ahvaz, Iran, during the year 2023. A stepwise cluster sampling technique was utilized to select a representative sample of 264 teachers. Data collection instruments included questionnaires measuring progressive personality, self-transcendence, eudaimonic well-being, and meaning in life. Statistical analysis relied on descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and structural equation modeling (SEM). The analysis revealed significant positive correlations (p< 0.01) among the variables. Specifically, eudaimonic well-being was positively related to both progressive personality and meaning in life. Self-transcendence was also positively associated with meaning in life, which, in turn, was positively related to progressive personality. Bootstrapping analysis confirmed that meaning in life significantly mediated the relationships between both self-transcendence and progressive personality, and eudaimonic well-being and progressive personality (p< 0.01). These findings supported the proposed model’s fit to the data.
The effects of serial order of presentation on parent ratings of items referring to the behavior of their children were examined using two scales measuring dispositions and psychopathology that were administered to a representative sample of 1,358 4–17 year olds. Items within each scale were pseudo-randomized instead of being grouped according to the constructs they were written to measure. Each scale was presented in either forward or reverse serial order, with parents who were unaware of all hypotheses being randomly selected for forward or reverse order of administration. In both the disposition and psychopathology scales, the same items were rated significantly differently depending on the order of presentation to the raters; ratings declined in magnitude as the parents rated increasing numbers of items. Although parent ratings presumably partly reflect the behavior of their children, they are biased by robust order effects. The unbiased counter-balancing of items in scale construction and the use of randomized forward versus reverse orders of scale administrations can be used to minimize extraneous order effects.
BackgroundPsychological safety is crucial for student-athletes, impacting their stress levels and academic anxiety. Understanding how interpersonal factors like intimacy and social adjustment impact psychological safety can guide interventions to enhance student-athlete well-being.ObjectivesThis study investigates the relationships between intimacy, social adjustment, psychological safety, perceived stress, and learning-related anxiety among student-athletes. It tests explicitly whether psychological safety mediates the effects of intimacy and social adjustment on perceived stress and learning-related anxiety.MethodologyA cross-sectional design was employed, involving 300 student-athletes from various universities in Wuhan, China. Participants completed measures of intimacy (RCI), social adjustment (SAS-SR), perceived stress (PSS), learning-related anxiety (LAS), and psychological safety (PSS). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze direct and indirect relationships among the variables.Results/DiscussionThe results revealed that intimacy and social adjustment positively impact psychological safety. In turn, psychological safety negatively affects perceived stress and learning-related anxiety. The mediation analysis showed that psychological safety significantly mediates the relationships between both intimacy and social adjustment with perceived stress and learning-related anxiety. Specifically, the study found that higher intimacy and social adjustment levels increased psychological safety, subsequently reducing perceived stress and anxiety levels. These findings underscore the importance of fostering a psychologically safe environment to mitigate stress and anxiety among student-athletes. The study’s implications suggest that coaches and educators should build supportive relationships and enhance social integration to improve psychological safety and overall athlete well-being.ConclusionThis study highlights the critical role of psychological safety in student athletes’ mental health. By promoting intimacy and social adjustment, institutions can enhance psychological safety, reduce stress and anxiety, and improve athletes’ academic and personal experiences. Future research should explore longitudinal effects and potential moderators to understand these relationships further.
Teachers are dealing with the challenges of educating students who have been exposed to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) at an increasing rate (Brunzell et al., 2021; Mayor, 2021). Often their education has not prepared them for recognizing and mitigating the behaviors associated with ACE exposures. This article offers a review of current research regarding the role of the school counselor in supporting teachers. A case study provides insight into this support through a university partnership with a trauma-focused charter school. Suggestions are offered for teacher training and policy changes based on the author's experiences in working with a trauma-focused school. Specifically, there are many areas where school counselors can provide advocacy and support through efforts within their role in the areas of defining, managing, delivering, and assessing ASCA (2024). Partnering with a university can provide needed services for schools while simultaneously offering learning opportunities for students.
Perceiving organizational support is a crucial factor in enhancing teacher job satisfaction and contributes to improving teacher job performance. Previous research has predominantly focused on the impact of job satisfaction on job performance, overlooking the interactions among factors shaping perceived organizational support. This study aims to examine the interrelationships among personality traits, perceived organizational support, self-efficacy, and job satisfaction in influencing teacher job performance. A total of 581 university teachers participated in an empirical study, and the results confirmed that perceived organizational support influences teacher job performance directly and indirectly through personality traits, self-efficacy, and job satisfaction. This study develops and validates a novel model illustrating how perceived organizational support indirectly influences teachers’job performance through personality traits, self-efficacy, and job satisfaction. By emphasizing the mediating roles of personality traits, self-efficacy, and job satisfaction, this study makes a significant contribution to the theoretical literature. Moreover, it provides valuable theoretical insights and practical guidance for universities to formulate support strategies tailored to teachers’ personality traits, thereby enhancing their job performance.
BackgroundMilitary personnel face an increased risk of developing mental disorders owing to the stressful environments they encounter. Effective stress management strategies are crucial to mitigate this risk. Mindfulness training (MT) is promising as a stress management approach in such demanding settings. This study uses a quantitative approach to investigate the impact of MT on the relationship between the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and emotional regulation.MethodsThe study evaluated the effectiveness of MT in reducing stress among 86 military personnel. Participants were divided into two groups: MT (n= 42) and non-MT (n= 38). The study compared the two groups using measures of heart rate variability (HRV), a reliable indicator of ANS activity.ResultsThe MT group exhibited a significant increase in HRV (14.4%,p= 0.001) and alpha asymmetry (AA) in the frontal lobe (45.7%,p< 0.001) compared to the non-MT group. Notably, the MT group achieved significantly higher scores on the parachute landing fall (PLF) training performance (p< 0.001). These improvements in HRV, AA, and PLF performance were strongly correlated. Furthermore, AA fully mediated the relationship between HRV and PLF training performance.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that MT has a positive impact on stress resilience, potentially by mitigating anxiety and attention deficits induced by extreme stressors. These positive effects are facilitated by concurrent modulation of the frontal cortex and autonomic nervous system. Our findings provide insight into the neural mechanisms behind MT-induced stress reduction from the perspective of neuromodulation.
In cognitive psychology, research on attention is shifting from focusing primarily on how people orient toward stimuli in the environment toward instead examining how people orient internally toward memory representations. With this new shift the question arises: What factors in the environment send attention inward? A recent proposal is that one factor is cue familiarity-detection (Cleary, Irving & Mills,Cognitive Science, 47, e13274, 2023). Within this theoretical framework, we reinterpret a decades-old empirical pattern—a primacy effect in memory for repetitions—in a novel way. The effect is the finding that altered repetitions of an image were remembered as re-occurrences of the first presentation despite having a changed left–right orientation; participants better retained the first orientation while incorrectly remembering changed instantiations as repetitions of the first orientation (DiGirolamo & Hintzman,Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 4, 121–124, 1997). We argue that this pattern, which has never been fully explained, is an existing empirical test of the newly proposed mechanism of cue familiarity-detection flipping attention inward toward memory. Specifically, an image’s first appearance is novel so draws attention outward toward encoding the stimulus’ attributes like orientation; subsequent mirror-reversed appearances are detected as familiar so flip attention inward toward memory search, which leads to 1) inattentional blindness for the changed orientation due to the familiarity-driven shift of attention inward and 2) memory retrieval of the first instance and its orientation, thereby enhancing memory for the first instance and its previously encoded attributes like orientation.
Culture can shape memory, but little research has investigated age effects. The present study examined the neural correlates of memory retrieval for old, new, and similar lures in younger and older Americans and Taiwanese. A total of 207 participants encoded pictures of objects and, during fMRI scanning, completed a surprise object recognition task testing discrimination of similar and new from old items. Results show that age and culture impact discrimination of old from new items. Taiwanese performed worse than Americans, with age effects more pronounced for Taiwanese. The cultural differences in the engagement of left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) in younger adults (i.e., greater activity for old [for Taiwanese] or new items [for Americans]) were eliminated with age. The results are interpreted as reflecting cultural differences in orientation to novelty versus familiarity for younger, but not older, adults, with the LIFG supporting interference resolution at retrieval. Support is not as strong for cultural differences in pattern separation processes. Although Americans had higher levels of memory discrimination than Taiwanese, neither cultural nor age differences were found in hippocampal activity, which is surprising given the region’s role in pattern separation. The findings suggest ways in which cultural life experiences and concomitant information processing strategies can contribute to consistent effects of age across cultures or contribute to different trajectories with age in terms of memory.
BackgroundSelf-control is essential for individual health and well-being. The relationship between mindfulness and self-control has recently become a central focus of research. However, the dynamics of this relationship in deaf and hearing individuals remain underexplored. This study, based on the Cognitive Behavioral Theory, developed a moderated mediation model to examine the mediating role of inner peace and the moderating role of group type in the mindfulness-self-control relationship.MethodsUsing a cross-sectional survey design, this study used a sample of 121 deaf and 142 hearing college students. A moderated mediation analysis was conducted based on participants’ responses to the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale, Peace of Mind Scale, and Belief Self-Control Scale.ResultsThe findings indicate a significant positive correlation between mindfulness and self-control across both groups. Inner peace partially mediates the mindfulness-self-control relationship for both groups. However, group type moderates the mindfulness-inner peace-self-control pathway. Specifically, in hearing individuals, mindfulness bolsters self-control by enhancing inner peace, whereas in deaf individuals, this mediation effect is weaker, with their self-control not correlating with increased inner peace.ConclusionThe results reveal that, despite shared psychological mechanisms in mindfulness and self-control between deaf and hearing individuals, the beneficial impact of inner peace on self-control is significantly lower in deaf individuals. This highlights the complex relationship shaped by diverse life experiences, underscoring the need for tailored interventions like mindfulness training to enhance positive emotions and self-control in deaf individuals.
Witnessing rejection against one’s group can have similar impacts on psychological distress and aggression as experiencing rejection personally. In this study, we investigated the neural activity patterns of group rejection and whether they resemble those of personal-level rejection. We first identified the neural correlates of social rejection (exclusion based on negative attention) compared with ostracism (exclusion based on lack of social connection) and then compared group-level to personal-level rejection. We employed a novel social exclusion task, “RateME,” to induce group and personal rejection and Cyberball to evoke ostracism during fMRI scans. Our results showed that personal rejection increased activity in regions associated with autobiographical memory and self-identity, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the lingual gyrus, whereas ostracism engaged areas related to social pain and salience, including the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula. Additionally, group and personal-level rejection elicited similar neural activity patterns, regardless of participants’ fusion with the rejected groups. Therefore, group membership seems sufficient for group rejection to trigger self-referential processing pathways similar to those activated by personal rejection. Our findings highlight the overlapping neural mechanisms underlying personal and group-level grievances, which may explain the detrimental effects of group rejection on aggression, extremism, and intergroup conflict.
A variety of different evidence-accumulation models (EAMs) account for common response time and accuracy patterns in two-alternative forced choice tasks by assuming that subjects collect and sum information from their environment until a response threshold is reached. Estimates of model parameters mapped to components of this decision process can be used to explain the causes of observed behavior. However, such explanations are only meaningful when parameters can be identified, that is, when their values can be uniquely estimated from data generated by the model. Prior studies suggest that parameter identifiability is poor when error rates are low but have not systematically compared this issue across different EAMs. We conducted a simulation study investigating the identifiability and estimation properties of model parameters at low error rates in the two most popular EAMs: The diffusion decision model (DDM) and the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA). We found poor identifiability at low error rates for both models but less so for the DDM and for a larger number of trials. The DDM also showed better identifiability than the LBA at low trial numbers for a design with a manipulation of response caution. Based on our results, we recommend tasks with error rates between 15% and 35% for small, and between 5% and 35% for large trial numbers. We explain the identifiability problem in terms of trade-offs caused by correlations between decision-threshold and accumulation-rate parameters and discuss why the models differ in terms of their estimation properties.
AbstractThe present study aims to fill the research gap by evaluating published empirical studies and answering the specific research question: Can individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) predict upcoming linguistic information during real-time language comprehension? Following the PRISMA framework, an initial search via PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar yielded a total of 697 records. After screening the abstract and full text, 10 studies, covering 350 children and adolescents with ASD ranging from 2 to 15 years old, were included for analysis. We found that individuals with ASD may predict the upcoming linguistic information by using verb semantics but not pragmatic prosody during language comprehension. Nonetheless, 9 out of 10 studies used short spoken sentences as stimuli, which may not encompass the complexity of language comprehension. Moreover, eye-tracking in the lab setting was the primary data collection technique, which may further limit the generalizability of the research findings. Using a narrative approach to synthesize and evaluate the research findings, we found that individuals with ASD may have the ability to predict the upcoming linguistic information. However, this field of research still calls for more studies that will expand the scope of research topics, utilize more complex linguistic stimuli, and employ more diverse data collection techniques.
This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Dietarian Identity Questionnaire (DIQ), an instrument based on the Unified Model of Vegetarian Identity (UMVI), within a Brazilian context of adult vegetarians, dietary vegans and omnivores. Vegetarianism encompasses various dietary patterns that range from avoiding and reducing to excluding animal-derived foods, as is the case with dietary vegans. The UMVI conceptualizes vegetarianism and related dietary patterns as dietarian identities. Dietarian identity represents a novel framework within the Brazilian context, underscoring the significance of the present study. After transcultural adaptation, a Brazilian sample was recruited in two stages (n= 1181 andn= 226), comprising omnivores, vegetarians, and dietary vegans, aged 18 to 60 years. Data was collected via the RedCap platform, with participants being reached through vegetarian/dietary vegan groups in social media and direct outreach to various vegetarian associations. Psychometric evaluation included confirmatory factor analysis, assessment of convergent validity, and test-retest reliability. Additionally, multiple ANOVAs were conducted to explore differences among omnivores, vegetarians, and dietary vegans in the Brazilian population. The confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the instrument's internal structure and validity, with test-retest reliability and convergent validity further supporting its psychometric properties. Brazilian omnivores exhibited higher levels of Centrality, Personal Regard, Strictness, and Prosocial and Moral Motivations compared to data from other cultural contexts, such as Europeans and North Americans. These findings highlight unique aspects of Brazilian dietarian identity, challenging existing literature and emphasizing the need for further exploration of cultural influences on dietarian identity, including regional and cross-cultural perspectives.
Social media users’ excessive preservation and collection of digital information result in digital hoarding. Understanding the internal motivations of users’ digital hoarding behavior is made possible by studying the factors that influence this behavior through the lens of perceived value. This study built a model to predict social media users’ digital hoarding, incorporating perceived ability, perceived usefulness, perceived richness, and perceived economy as antecedent variables and security as a mediating variable. An online survey conducted in China (n= 834) using SPSS and R Studio revealed that perceived ability, perceived richness, and perceived economy promote digital hoarding behavior, both directly and indirectly via the mediation of security. These findings provide support for the proposed role of security as an underlying mechanism that explains digital hoarding behavior. The study holds significant implications for the crafting of strategies to facilitate healthier digital storage habits.

The current study explored the bridge symptoms between parental involvement and depression and the sex difference between this network. The participants included 772 adolescents (50.06% girl,Mage = 11.77,SD= 0.72) in China. They were recruited to complete the questionnaires regarding parental involvement and depression. Results showed that the network had eight bridge symptoms (pi6, pi12, pi17, pi20, pi21, dp8, dp12, dp16). Besides, there were significant sex differences between symptom networks. The network structure invariance test revealed significant differences in the overall network structure between the networks for boys and girls.
Guided by the theory of self-compassion and the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, we aimed to assess how self-compassion is related to psychological distress among Chinese college students. A convenience sample of 2,263 Chinese college students from four universities participated in this cross-sectional study. They completed measures assessing (un)compassionate self-responding, positive emotions, negative emotions, resilience resources, and psychological distress through an online survey platform. We found that positive emotions and resilience resources significantly mediated the associations between (un)compassionate self-responding and psychological distress. Future studies on mental health promotion programs based on self-compassion should evaluate whether interventions for enhancing positive emotions effectively boost resilience resources and adjustment outcomes during future pandemics. For application, university counselling centers may offer self-compassion workshops or groups to college students during transitional periods.
The error-related negativity (ERN) has been called a putative neural marker of anxiety risk in children, with smaller ERN amplitudes denoting greater risk in early childhood. Children of anxious mothers are at elevated risk for anxiety problems compared to children of non-anxious mothers. Still unknown is whether discrete maternal symptoms interact with child ERN to predict different forms of child anxiety risk, knowledge of which could increase our understanding of the specificity of known conditions and pathways for transgenerational effects. Targeting two of the most prevalent forms of anxiety problems across children and adults, we tested whether maternal generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social phobia (SP) symptoms when children were 3 years old interacted with child ERN at age 4 years to predict child symptoms of overanxiousness and separation anxiety at age 5 years. We found that greater maternal SP, but not GAD, symptoms along with smaller (i.e., less negative) child ERN predicted more separation anxiety and overanxious symptoms in children, suggesting some specificity in prediction but less specificity in outcomes regarding the transmission of anxiety risk from mothers to offspring.
Actors need to memorize lines of text to audition for roles with a limited amount of time; therefore, an evidenced-based system may help ensure adequate preparation for auditions. Precision Teaching is a subspecialty within behavior analysis focused on precise definitions and continuous measurement of dimensional features of behavior and analyzes behavioral data to accelerate behavioral repertoires by promoting fluency. One way to promote fluency is through Say All Fast Minute Each Day Shuffled (SAFMEDS), a procedure that has been shown to increase recall through practice and assessment and is a systematic tool for learning that is an improvement over standard flashcard methods. The current study compares the effects of see-say and hear-say learning channel sets on the recall of long theatrical texts for one actor and one non-actor using an adapted alternating treatments design. Results demonstrate that the hear-say learning channel set was most effective for both participants. Additionally, these skills generalized during MESAA tests for both monologues and participants in the absence of the SAFMEDS cards and in novel environments. Participants reported high satisfaction with both treatments, indicating high utility in developing fluency.
BackgroundWeight stigma is pervasive, and it has a significant impact on the social, physical, and psychological health of an individual. Weight stigma is observed from several different sources. Therefore, the present study developed and validated a new instrument, the Weight Stigma Exposure Inventory (WeSEI), to assess different sources of observed weight stigma across interpersonal and non-interpersonal sources.MethodsThe participants (n = 15,991) comprised Taiwanese young adults, Chinese adolescents, and Chinese young adults who completed paper-and-pencil and online surveys between September 2023 and December 2023. All participants provided demographic information, and completed the WeSEI, Weight Self-Stigma Questionnaire (WSSQ), and Perceived Weight Stigmatization Scale (PWSS). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to examine the factor structure of the WeSEI.ResultsEFA and CFA results confirmed a seven-factor structure (television sources, traditional media sources, social media sources, parent sources, stranger sources, significant other sources, and friends sources) across 35 items of the WeSEI. Moreover, the WeSEI was supported by measurement invariance across subgroups (i.e., subsamples, gender, and weight status). Moreover, there were positive correlations between all seven factors of the WeSEI and the WSSQ and PWSS.ConclusionThe WeSEI appears to assess observed weight stigma from different sources, and had good reliability, validity, and invariance across various subsamples. The WeSEI may be useful in clinical practice and research for assessing exposure to weight stigma from different sources.
Compulsivity has been associated with variable behavior under uncertainty. However, previous work has not distinguished between two main sources of behavioral variability: the stochastic selection of choice options that do not maximize expected reward (choice variability) and random noise in the reinforcement learning process that updates option values from choice outcomes (learning variability). Here we study the relation between dimensional compulsivity and behavioral variability using a computational model that dissociates its two sources. Across two independent datasets (137 and 123 participants), we found that compulsivity is associated with more frequent switches between options, triggered by increased choice variability, but no change in learning variability. This effect of compulsivity on the ‘trait’ component of choice variability is observed even in conditions where this source of behavioral variability yields no cognitive benefits. These findings indicate that compulsive individuals make variable and suboptimal choices under uncertainty, but do not hold degraded representations of option values.
IntroductionMusic is known to impact attentional state without conscious awareness. Listening to music encourages the brain to secrete neurotransmitters improving cognition and emotion.Aim of workAnalysis of QEEG band width while listening to two music types, identifying different cortical areas activated and which genre has a similar effect to relaxed EEG.MethodsThis is a cross-section interventional analytic study including 76 normal subjects, 55 of them are females (72.37%). Participants listened to 10 min of a single audio track during EEG recording, consisting of (1 min of silence, 3 min of Egyptian folk music, 3 min of silence, then 3 min of Egyptian instrumental classic music (without any lyrics). We analyzed QEEG bands at each brain region during different tracks. The power ratio index (PRI) was calculated for each region, and then the interhemispheric difference was compared.ResultsThe participants’ ages ranged from 15 to 26 with a mean 16.73 ± 2.37 years. PRI showed a significant increase in the frontal and occipital regions during listening to folk music compared to the silent epoch, where p < 0.001 and p = 0.023, respectively. In the frontal and temporal regions, the classic music epoch evoked the highest PRI interhemispheric difference compared to the folk music epoch, where p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively.ConclusionEgyptian folk music has significantly slowed the brain rhythm, particularly in the frontal region, compared to classic music, supporting the hypothesis of a momentary reduction of cognitive capacities by the noise. Classic music was evidently associated with a relaxed state EEG.
BackgroundLimited research has been conducted on the relationship between inflammatory markers and psychological status in medical staff fighting COVID-19.ObjectiveThis article examines the psychological and inflammatory conditions of medical personnel working on the front lines of the battle against COVID-19. Methods: A total of 102 clinical staff members were included in this study. All subjects received the Symptom Checklist-90 questionnaire (SCL-90) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian questionnaires for assessing different mental symptoms. The levels of various inflammatory markers, including IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, and IFN-γ, along with GDNF, were evaluated.ResultsSpearman correlation analysis showed that the levels of IL-6 were positively associated with the anxiety score (Spearman’s rho= .230,p= .021), obsessive–compulsive symptoms (Spearman’s rho= .201,p= .042). The levels of IL-8 were negatively associated with the anxiety score (Spearman’s rho= -.223,p= .028), obsessive–compulsive symptoms (Spearman’s rho = -.252,p= .012), hyperarousal (Spearman’s rho= -.221,p= .028). The levels of TNF-α were positively associated with the anxiety score (Spearman’s rho= .201,p= .045), obsessive–compulsive symptoms (Spearman’s rho= .222,p= .035).ConclusionGenerally, our results suggested that IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α might play a role in the development of psychological symptoms among medical staff.
Teacher well-being has increasingly become a prominent research topic due to its significant impact on various teacher and student outcomes. This focus is particularly crucial for early career teachers, who often encounter numerous challenges at the beginning of their careers, leading to elevated levels of stress and burnout. Our study aimed to examine the relationship between social and emotional competencies and burnout of early career teachers and the potential mediating role of teacher self-efficacy in this relationship. A total of 657 Croatian subject teachers with up to 5 years of experience participated in the study. Structural equation modelling was implemented to test models of hypothesised relations for the overall burnout as a dependent variable and for each burnout dimension: exhaustion, mental distance, cognitive impairment, and emotional impairment. Tested models singled out self-management and social awareness as two social and emotional competencies that are, along with teacher self-efficacy, particularly predictive of burnout. Self-management predicted lower overall burnout and teacher self-efficacy partially mediated this relationship. Social awareness also predicted lower burnout in teachers, but this relationship was fully mediated by teacher self-efficacy. Early career teachers who are better at managing and motivating themselves, who are socially aware and behave more prosocially were feeling more efficacious as teachers and, subsequently, displayed fewer symptoms of burnout. At the level of burnout dimensions, the overall pattern of relations was mainly retained, indicating that self-management and social awareness are particularly predictive of the four burnout dimensions and that self-efficacy plays a mediating role, either partially or fully, in this relationship. Our findings are especially important in light of the knowledge about early years in teaching being a critical period for teacher career development. They suggest that new teachers could benefit from well-structured mentoring and induction programs designed to ease their transition into schools and foster their well-being in the initial years of teaching.
ObjectiveTo study the heterogeneity and influencing factors of self-acceptance of drug addicts in compulsory isolation in 2 drug rehabilitation centers in Sichuan Province, and to analyze the effects of different types of self-acceptance on subthreshold depression in drug addicts, in order to provide useful references for improving their mental health.MethodsSelf-acceptance Questionnaire (SAQ), Drug use Stereotype Threat Scale(DSTS) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale(CES-D) were used to conduct a questionnaire survey in January 2024 on 1068 drug addicts in two compulsory isolation drug rehabilitation centers in Sichuan Province.ResultsDrug addicts self-acceptance can be categorized into 5 potential categories; men were more likely than women to show lower self-acceptance in the ‘low-low’(β = 0.285,OR = 0.381, p < 0.001),‘low-high’(β = 0.331,OR = 0.383,p = 0.004), and‘high-low’(β = 0.283,OR = 0.548, p = 0.033) groups compared to the ‘ high-high’ group; drug addicts with an education level of elementary school and below were categorized into the‘low -low ’ group(β = 0.642,OR = 6.173, p = 0.005);HIV-negative drug addicts were more likely to show higher self-acceptance than positive patients(β = 0.418,OR = 2.427, p = 0.034)); the‘low-low’group had the greatest likelihood of being alienated(β = 0.169,OR = 3.249, p < 0.001). The results of multiple linear regression showed that drug addicts in the‘ moderate-moderate ’group and‘high-high ’group had significantly lower subthreshold depression than those in the‘low-low ’group; the results of the Kruskal-Wallis Test showed that the‘high -high ’group had the lowest level of subthreshold depression, and the‘low -low ’,‘low-high ’and‘high-low ’groups had the highest mean ranks in different dimensions of subthreshold depression(P < 0.001).ConclusionHeterogeneity exists in drug addicts’ self-acceptance, and gender, HIV-positive or not, education level, and drug use stereotype threat are factors influencing self-acceptance in compulsory isolated drug addicts. High self-appraisal-high self-acceptance had the lowest level of subthreshold depression in drug addicts, and the consistency of poor self-appraisal and self-acceptance also affected the level of subthreshold depression in drug addicts.
BackgroundThis research focuses on examining and comparing the aggression levels of prisoners incarcerated for intentional injury and amateur combat athletes. The study aims to explore the differences in aggression levels among these groups to understand the impact of incarceration and sports participation on aggression.MethodsThe participants included in the analysis consist of prisoners (n= 363) housed in Marmara No. 7 and No. 3 Type L Closed Penal Institutions, who have been incarcerated for intentional injury, with an average age of 36.64 ± 10.30 years and an average custody period of 980.47 ± 1335.27 days. Amateur combat athletes (n= 203) with an average age of 25.17 ± 10.09 years have been actively engaged in sports for an average of 11.83 ± 9.53 years. The control group (n= 329) has an average age of 32.65 ± 7.56 years. Data collection instruments included a personal information form and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0, with a significance level set atp< 0.05.ResultsAnalysis of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire scores revealed that the aggression levels of prisoners incarcerated for intentional injury were statistically significantly lower than those of both amateur combat athletes and control group participants (p< 0.001). Additionally, a significant reduction in overall aggression scores was observed among prisoners as the number of days in custody increased (p= 0.045). No significant differences were found among amateur combat athletes concerning the discipline variable, and no meaningful relationship was identified between years of active sports participation and aggression scores.ConclusionThe findings indicate that educational, social, and sports activities organized in correctional facilities can be effective in reducing aggression levels among inmates. Systematic planning, professional implementation, and continuous evaluation of such programs can make significant contributions to the rehabilitation of prisoners and their successful reintegration into society.
Examining the quality of life outcomes and supports of autistic people, particularly without proxies, is important to inform research and service delivery – not only for it to be more evidenced-based, but also to ensure services and supports are successfully supporting autistic people in ways that are important to them. The aim of this exploratory study was to examine the quality of life personal outcomes of autistic people; our secondary aim was to examine the presence of person-centered organizational supports to facilitate autistic people’s outcomes. We analyzed secondary Personal Outcome Measures interview data from 860 autistic adults (January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2023), many of which also had additional intellectual/developmental disabilities. Autistic people had 50.4% of outcomes present; they were most likely to be safe and have the best possible health, and least likely to choose where and with whom to live, and choose their services. Autistic people had 52.1% of individualized supports in place. While there were differences in autistic people’s outcomes and supports based on their sociodemographics, the presence of supports played a larger role in quality of life. While much work remains, our findings indicate that with thoughtful, person-centered services and supports, autistic people’s outcomes improve tremendously.
The impact of the boarding school milieu on the psychological development of children has garnered considerable attention. Scholars have especially expressed apprehension regarding the potential adverse effects of boarding on familial bonds. Addressing this concern, certain primary schools in Yunnan Province have implemented a Kinship boarding system, wherein older students are entrusted with the care of younger ones. The present study explored the progression of sharing behaviors among children in boarding environments and the mechanisms underlying these behaviors. Utilizing methodologies such as story completion, the dictator game, and motivational ranking, this study compared the sharing consciousness and behaviors of children under different administrative approaches: kinship boarding, class boarding, and day school. Additionally, we examined the roles of moral reasoning and empathy in how boarding styles influence sharing behaviors. The results revealed that children in kinship boarding exhibited more sharing consciousness, as well as both proactive and reactive sharing behaviors, compared to their counterparts in class boarding or day school settings. Furthermore, affective and cognitive empathy function as mediators in the relationship between boarding styles and children’s sharing behaviors, with sharing consciousness serving as a moderating factor.
This article explores the embodied dimension of authoring life trajectories for individuals who have undergone heart transplantation. Confronting the radical otherness of existential finitude can create a rich context for examining the relationships between authorship, corporeality, and creative processes. By integrating Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of the body with Susanne Langer’s theory of affective semiosis and presentational signs, this work aims to foster a productive dialogue between these perspectives, grounded in Semiotic Cultural Psychology, which meta-theoretically synthesizes a diverse range of knowledge on the transformative interaction between individuals and culture. The article presents three participants’ cases, selected for their ideographic expressiveness, as empirical evidence that both enlivens and enriches this study’s theoretical and epistemological foundations. The fragments of participants’ elaborations were derived from individual interviews conducted at the IMIP heart transplant clinic between 2022 and 2023. IMIP is a university hospital located in Recife. The interviewees were adults who had undergone transplantation at least one year prior. The discussion of the reports highlights three interpretative axes: (a) embodied ambiguities and tensions experienced; (b) living metaphors and potential presentational signs regarding life trajectories; (c) ways of referencing the future and temporality of experiences felt intensely in the present and their methods of reconstructing the past. The interpretative analysis of participants’ metaphors aims to shed light on the role of corporeality in the construction of meaning and, consequently, in the creative perspective of life and the sense of authorship when facing the alterity, in this case, specifically of illness and consecutive heart transplantation. This article seeks to contribute to studying affective semiosis and corporeality in Cultural Psychology by highlighting its hermeneutic relevance as a critical feature of the human cultural construction of the self, others, and the world.
The analysis of eye movements is a noninvasive, reliable and fast method to detect and quantify brain (dys)function. Here, we investigated the performance of two novel eye-trackers—the Thomas Oculus Motus-research mobile (TOM-rm) and the TOM-research stationary (TOM-rs)—and compared them with the performance of a well-established video-based eye-tracker, i.e., the EyeLink 1000 Plus (EL). The TOM-rm is a fully integrated, tablet-based mobile device that presents visual stimuli and records head-unrestrained eye movements at 30 Hz without additional infrared illumination. The TOM-rs is a stationary, video-based eye-tracker that records eye movements at either high spatial or high temporal resolution. We compared the performance of all three eye-trackers in two different behavioral tasks: pro- and anti-saccade and free viewing. We collected data from 30 human subjects while running all three eye-tracking devices in parallel. Parameters requiring a high spatial or temporal resolution (e.g., saccade latency or gain), as derived from the data, differed significantly between the EL and the TOM-rm in both tasks. Differences between results derived from the TOM-rs and the EL were most likely due to experimental conditions, which could not be optimized for both systems simultaneously. We conclude that the TOM-rm can be used for measuring basic eye-movement parameters, such as the error rate in a typical pro- and anti-saccade task, or the number and position of fixations in a visual foraging task, reliably at comparably low spatial and temporal resolution. The TOM-rs, on the other hand, can provide high-resolution oculomotor data at least on a par with an established reference system.
The value of population screening for suicide risk remains unclear. The US Army’s annual medical examination, the Periodic Health Assessment (PHA), screens for suicidality and other mental and physical health problems. Here in our 2014–2019 cohort study we used PHA and Army administrative data (n= 1,042,796 PHAs from 452,473 soldiers) to develop a model to predict 6-month nonfatal and fatal suicide attempts (SAs). The model was designed to establish eligibility for a planned high-risk SA prevention intervention. The PHA suicide risk screening questions had limited value, as 95% of SAs occurred among soldiers who denied suicidality. However, a simple least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized regression model that included a wide range of administrative predictors had good test sample discrimination (0.794 (standard error 0.009) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (integrated calibration index 0.0001). The 25% of soldiers at highest predicted risk accounted for 69.5% of 6-month SAs, supporting use of the model to target preventive interventions.
ObjectivesBoth mindfulness and humor are inherently connected to well-being. Recent research found evidence for their combined effect in a joint training, the Humor-Enriched Mindfulness-Based Program (HEMBP). This study extends these findings by exploring (1) effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on different forms of humor, (2) differential effects of the HEMBP on outcomes compared to MBSR, and (3) whether the HEMBP and MBSR may alter worldviews.MethodNinety participants were randomly allocated to three conditions: the HEMBP, MBSR, and a wait-list control group. Participants’ mindfulness, psychological well-being, life satisfaction, perceived stress, comic styles, and primal world beliefs (primals) were assessed before and after the trainings, and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups. Changes in outcome variables over time were modeled by applying linear mixed-effects models.ResultsThe HEMBP enhanced participants’ mindfulness, benevolent humor, psychological well-being, and life satisfaction compared to the wait-list control. Similarly, MBSR increased participants’ mindfulness and life satisfaction while reducing perceived stress and primalgood, but no effects on humor were observed. Comparison between the two trainings revealed trends toward a greater increase in benevolent humor in the HEMBP group and a greater decrease ingoodin the MBSR group.ConclusionThe results largely replicate previous research on the efficacy of the HEMBP. Both programs demonstrated similar effects on outcomes, with only the HEMBP increasing benevolent humor and psychological well-being, while MBSR reduced stress. Further research is needed to investigate qualitative aspects of the integration of humor in MBPs and the long-term impact of MBPs on individuals’ worldviews.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.
The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionally affected parents with young children whose incomes are below the federal poverty threshold. However, studies examining life changes related to parents’ mental well-being due to pandemic effects are limited. In addition, given the racial disparities in mental health established in prior literature, clarifying the role of race in the relationships between life changes and parents’ mental well-being may help identify culturally responsive interventions that support racially/ethnically diverse families in crisis. Therefore, using a cross-sectional survey, this descriptive and exploratory study examined the impact of COVID-19 on the life changes of 408 English-speaking parents of preschool children whose incomes were below the federal poverty threshold. Half of the parents indicated that the pandemic had a negative impact on their life, including loss of employment, financial difficulty, difficulty accessing food, and challenges with finding childcare. While some parents reported feeling closer to their children, the majority felt more stressed, anxious, and depressed after the pandemic started. Not surprisingly, physical activity and better parent-child relationships were associated with reduced levels of stress and depression in parents in addition to access to childcare support. Interestingly, the negative impact of the pandemic was more correlated with White parents’ stress, anxiety, and depression than Black parents. During the post-pandemic phase, providing parental support to improve family cohesion and interactions is promising in minimizing stress, anxiety, and depression. Results from this study should be interpreted with caution due to the nature of the cross-sectional design and use of self-report data from parents.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety disorders are early-onset mental disorders characterized by selective attention and strong emotional reactions. Attentional bias has been proposed to play a role in the development, onset, and maintenance of the disorders, but few studies have included youth with mental disorders, and no study has included more than one clinical group, making it unclear whether biased attention is disorder-specific or transdiagnostic in nature. In the present study, 65 youths with OCD (Mage= 13.6 [2.4], 57% girls), 52 youths with anxiety disorders (Mage= 14.5 [2.6] 83% girls), and 45 youths without a psychiatric disorder (Mage= 13.9 [3.1], 67% girls) completed a modified dot-probe task that included threat, incompleteness, and disgust cues. Contrary to our hypotheses, no group exhibited any attentional bias to any emotional cue, no group differences were present, and individual differences in attentional bias were not associated with individual differences in any symptom type. Disgust cues produced slower response times compared to the other emotional cues, but this effect was consistent across all type of trials and present in all three groups. In this study, no support for biased attention in treatment-seeking youth with OCD or anxiety disorders was found, which is in line with recent findings in adults using the dot-probe task. As attentional processes are clearly implicated in the clinical manifestation of these disorders, future research should try to better operationalize and measure relevant processes.
Psychological Inflexibility (PI) is related to negative psychological, social, and academic adjustment among university students. The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire for University Students (AAQ-US) was developed as a specific measure of PI in university contexts to overcome some limitations of general PI questionnaires to predict mental health and academic performance in university students. This study addresses the validation of the Italian version of the AAQ-US in two samples of Italian undergraduate students. Sample 1 consisted of 118 university students (67.8% females, Mean age = 23.2 years) and Sample 2 consisted of 190 students (72.1% females, Mean age = 22.7 years). In addition to the AAQ-US, participants completed measures of psychological outcomes (anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction), academic functioning (procrastination, average grade, and completed courses), and general PI. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses supported a one-factor model for the AAQ-US scores. Measurement invariance across gender was also supported. The internal consistency was excellent in both samples. Higher AAQ-US scores were significantly related to poorer psychological outcomes and academic functioning, supporting the concurrent validity. The Italian version of the AAQ-US also proved convergent validity with measures of general PI and incremental validity in predicting psychological (anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction) as well as academic outcomes above and beyond measures of general PI. The Italian version of the AAQ-US proved to be a reliable and valid measure of PI in university contexts, and more useful than measures of general PI to predict academic outcomes.
This article describes the findings of a study that explored potential factors that influence the pass rate for those taking marriage and family therapy (MFT) licensing exams, both the national and California exams. An online, national survey was conducted to determine factors associated with passing the MFT licensing exams. The survey included measures of test anxiety, coping strategies, perceived stress, and experience of discrimination. The demographic results included patterns of racial and age disparities similar to those reported by the Association of Social Work Boards (2022), especially for Black respondents. Specific and readily implemented recommendations for making the current exams more equitable include (a) changing the phrasing of questions, (b) clarifying and reducing the scope of the content, (c) reducing the number of questions during the 4-hour period, and (d) ensuring adequate accommodations for disabilities.
PurposeOur goals were to: 1) examine the occurrence of behavioral and emotional symptoms in children on the autism spectrum in a large national sample, stratifying by sex, and 2) evaluate whether children with increased autism-related social communication deficits also experience more behavioral and emotional problems.MethodsParticipants (n = 7,998) were from 37 cohorts from the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program. Cross-sectional information on demographic factors, parent-report of an ASD diagnosis by clinician, Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scores were obtained for children aged 2.5–18 years by surveys. We examined mean differences in CBCL Total Problems and DSM-oriented subscale scores by autism diagnosis and by child sex. Analyses using logistic regression were conducted to examine whether autism was associated with higher CBCL scores. We further examined if these relationships differed by child age category (< 6 years, 6–11 years, 12 + years). The relationships between SRS score and CBCL total and subscale scores were examined using quantile regression models, with analyses adjusted for child sex and age.ResultsIn ECHO, 553 youth were reported by a parent to have a clinician diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (432 [78%] boys and 121 [22%] girls). Youth on the spectrum had higher mean CBCL raw scores on Total Problems and all DSM-oriented subscales compared to those not on the spectrum (all p < 0.0001). Analyses adjusted for sex and stratified by age group indicated that higher odds of autism diagnosis were associated with total, depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) scales in the top 30% of the CBCL score distribution. Autistic girls were more likely to have parent-reported depression and anxiety compared to autistic boys. In quantile regression analyses, we observed evidence of stronger associations between SRS and CBCL for those in higher quantiles of CBCL total problems scale score (beta representing 1-unit change in SRS associated with 1-unit increase in CBCL total problems scale score), among children in the 70-90th percentile (β = 1.60, p < 0.01), or top 10th percentile (β = 2.43, p < 0.01) of the CBCL total problems scale score distribution. Similar findings were seen for the DSM-oriented depression, anxiety, and ADHD subscales.ConclusionResults from this large national sample suggest increased behavioral and emotional problems among autistic children compared to non-autistic children throughout early life. Among children on the spectrum this may warrant increased monitoring for co-occurring behavioral and emotional problems.
Measuring attention and engagement is essential for understanding a wide range of psychological phenomena. Advances in technology have made it possible to measure real-time attention to naturalistic stimuli, providing ecologically valid insight into temporal dynamics. We developed a research protocol calledTrace, which records anonymous facial landmarks, expressions, and patterns of movement associated with engagement in screen-based media. Trace runs in a standard internet browser and resembles a contemporary media player. It is embedded in the open-source package PsychoJS (the JavaScript sister library of PsychoPy) hosted via Pavlovia, and can be integrated with a wide range of behavioral research methods. Developed over multiple iterations and tested with over 200 participants in three studies, including the official broadcast of a major theatre production, Trace is a powerful, user-friendly protocol allowing behavioral researchers to capture audience attention and engagement in screen-based media as part of authentic, ecologically valid audience experiences.
The ability to monitor for rare critical events tends to deteriorate over time on task, an effect termed thevigilance decrement. Although the decrement has been replicated many times, it has generally been studied with sensory discrimination tasks. Research using cognitive vigilance tasks, which require judgments of symbolic stimulus characteristics, has produced less consistent results. To test the robustness and nature of the cognitive vigilance decrement, the current study developed a computational performance model of a novel monitoring task. Participants monitored for critical events in a task that required them to estimate the central tendency of a set of three-digit readings each trial. For analysis, data from the first and last 4-min blocks of trials were fit with a model based on signal detection theory. The model assumed that participants could either perform the task in an attentive state, in which decisions were stimulus-driven, or could lapse into an inattentive state, in which decisions were guessed. Parameter estimates indicated an increase in attentional lapse rate and a decrease in positive guess rate over time, coupled with a decrease in internal processing noise. The effects of these latent changes on observable response rates, however, were modest and partially offsetting. Results suggest that attention lapses and a tendency toward negative guesses are common causes of vigilance loss across sensory and cognitive tasks, but can have small effects on observed responses.
Episodic memory and future thinking are generally considered as two parts of the same mental time travelling system in vertebrates. Modern cephalopods, with their independent evolutionary lineage and their complex cognitive abilities, appear as promising species to determine whether these abilities have separate evolutionary histories or not. In our study, we tested future-planning abilities in a cephalopod species which has been shown to possess episodic-like memory abilities: the common cuttlefish. They were tested on their ability to plan for a future need for food instead of following their current need to hide. To explore the flexibility in such future-planning behaviour, we varied the protective value of the shelter. No future-planning behaviour was observed in cuttlefish during our experiment regardless of the value of the shelter provided. From one perspective, as cuttlefish were facing a trade-off decision, the attractiveness of the shelter (to satisfy their current need) might have been of higher value than their future need to eat (low drive for food). By contrast, our results might reflect an inability of cuttlefish to act in the present to secure future needs, suggesting that episodic memory and future planning might be distinct cognitive traits with their own evolutionary histories. Identifying both similarities and differences in complex cognition between vertebrate species and cephalopods is important to pinpoint which evolutionary pressures have led to the emergence of complex cognitive abilities.
The purpose of this study was to develop a five-item form of the Religious and Spiritual Struggles Scale (RSS; Exline et al.,Psychology of Religion and Spirituality, 6, 208-222,2014), (2022). Drawing upon three samples – 711 depressed adults from prior studies that utilized the RSS (Study 1), 303 undergraduates from a public university in the Southeastern U.S. (Study 2), and 121 adults seeking psychotherapy and/or primary care in an integrated behavioral health clinic (Study 3) – findings indicated the five-item version represents a structurally sound and reliable instrument for assessing clinically relevant struggles (divine, interpersonal, moral, doubt, ultimate meaning struggles) in mental health care settings. Specifically, Cronbach’s alphas for the RSS-5 ranged from .77 to .85 across the three studies. Further, scores on this short form overlapped highly with the original RSS in Study 1 and were moderately to strongly associated with validated assessments of positive (well-being, flourishing, and perceived meaning in life) and negative (suicide ideation, depression and anxiety symptoms) mental health in Study 2 and 3. When accounting for depression and anxiety symptoms, RSS-5 scores were also uniquely associated with patients’ suicidal ideation over the past month in Study 3. Although we found evidence of multidimensionality of the selected items that aligned with psychometric findings for the original RSS (Exline et al.,Psychology of Religion and Spirituality, 6, 208-222,2014), findings also supported a unidimensional factor structure for the RSS-5 in each sample. Looking ahead, the RSS-5 will hopefully support clinical research and practice in ways that enhance training clinicians’ responsiveness to patients who are experiencing spiritual struggles.
ObjectivesMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a severe and widespread psychiatric condition that affects individuals globally. Suicidal ideation is one of the key symptoms associated with this disorder. Numerous studies have explored the impact of adverse childhood experiences on the development of suicidal thoughts in adulthood. However, limited research focuses on the underlying mechanisms that mediate this relationship. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate whether emotional reactivity, along with probabilistic and reinforcement learning (PRL), serves as a mediator in the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and suicidal ideation in Iranian patients with MDD.MethodThe study included 201 inpatients diagnosed with MDD hospitalized in various psychiatric wards across Shiraz, Iran. Participants were selected using a convenient sampling method. Data were collected through the Probabilistic Reward Task, the Emotional Reactivity Scale, the Beck Scale of Suicidal Ideation, and the Modified Adverse Childhood Experiences – International Questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation test and structural equation modeling with SPSS and AMOS 26.ResultsAdverse childhood experiences were found to have a direct and significant relationship with suicidal ideation (p< .001). Additionally, emotional reactivity and PRL served as significant mediators in the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and suicidal ideation.ConclusionOur findings indicate that various factors—including adverse childhood experiences, emotional reactivity, and PRL—contribute to the development of suicidal ideation in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Therefore, it is essential to consider these factors when developing therapeutic plans.
This article explores the role of constructive anger in motivating and sustaining climate action. It considers relevant research in climate psychology with special attention to the dynamic between climate-related anger, action, and hope. The psychological research is then applied to a reconstruction of the concept of anger and hope in philosophical and theological approaches. Developing the concept of constructive anger, this article suggests that such constructive anger can be a factor in moving through apathy, fear, and depression and mobilizing toward collective climate action. Climate-related anger can be relieved through collective forms of climate action and the sense of collective efficacy that can emerge in becoming active. These can become a means to generating resistant, active, constructive forms of hope that can be distinguished from deceptive forms of hope.
The viewpoint that unitization provides a possibility of increasing the contribution of familiarity to associative memory has been widely accepted, but its effects on associative memory and recollection remain controversial. The current study aims to explain these mixed results by considering a potential moderator: changes in the level of unitization from encoding to retrieval phases. During the encoding phase, participants learned the related and unrelated picture pairs (i.e., high vs. low levels of unitization). Subsequently, they needed to distinguish between the intact and rearranged pairs during retrieval, where, in these rearranged pairs, the level of unitization from encoding to retrieval phases may or may not change. Meanwhile, the scalp electroencephalographic activity (EEG) was recorded. The results showed a significant familiarity-related FN400 old/new effect for related picture pairs alone, which supported the above viewpoint. However, its impact on the associative memory and recollection-related LPC old/new effects varied with the level of unitization changes—specifically, under the unchanged conditions. Although related pairs elicited significant FN400 and LPC old/new effects, the differences in these old/new effects and associative memory between the related and unrelated picture pairs were not significant. Conversely, under the changed conditions, related picture pairs not only elicited significantly larger FN400 and LPC old/new effects but also improved associative memory more than unrelated picture pairs. These findings not only clarify some of the inconsistencies in the literature concerning the impact of unitization on associative memory but also suggest that unitization affects the contributions of familiarity and recollection to associative memory differently, its effectiveness varying with the level of unitization changes.
Emotion regulation is integral to well-being and adaptive behavior. Differing regulation strategies have important downstream consequences. Evidence suggests that reappraisal use can improve memory and reduce emotional reactivity to previously regulated stimuli. Reappraisal is cognitively demanding and dependent on prefrontal-based cognitive control processes typically enhanced by motivation. We recently demonstrated that motivational incentives increased reappraisal use and decreased negative affect during emotion regulation. It is currently unknown how incentive manipulations of emotion regulation affect later memory and affective response: some accounts suggest that motivation boosts memory relatively automatically, via dopamine input to hippocampus, whereas others suggest that motivated memory might depend on control allocation at encoding. In a 2-day online study, we examined how motivated emotion regulation relates to downstream memory and affect. Participants completed an emotion regulation task under baseline and incentive conditions, with recognition memory and affect examined ~ 24-hours later. Surprisingly, for stimuli encountered under incentive, memory decreased, challenging the hypothesis that motivational enhancements of memory occur automatically. Additionally, Day 2 affect did not significantly differ for stimuli encountered in baseline and incentive contexts, suggesting that incentive-related affective benefits were short-lived. In contrast, reappraisal predicted increased memory and reduced negative affect upon reencounter. These results suggest that incentive may have promoted global, potentially automatic changes in affect, independent from regulatory control processes that also could lead to affective change. Further characterization of these multiple pathways will be important for advancing a mechanistic understanding of emotion regulation and its consequences across motivational contexts.
The present study investigated the role of inhibition in peripheral cueing by nonpredictive cues. Based on past findings, we investigated the possibility that inhibition of learned irrelevant cue colors is typical of short cue-target intervals, with more competition for attention capture between cue versus target. In line with the expectation, in a modified contingent-capture protocol, with short cue-target intervals, we found same-location costs (SLCs) – that is, disadvantages for validly cued targets (cue = target position) compared to invalidly cued targets (cue ≠ target position) with consistently colored non-matching cues. In contrast, no such effects for inconsistently colored non-matching cues were observed with short intervals. In a control condition, with longer intervals, the differences between consistently and inconsistently colored cues were no longer observed. We argue that this effect is due to participants proactively inhibiting consistently colored non-matching cues with short intervals but not with long intervals, but that inhibition failed with inconsistently colored non-matching cues that could take on different possible colors. Alternative explanations in terms of object-updating costs or masking were ruled out. We conclude that the currently found type of inhibition of peripheral cues most likely reflected the limitation of proactively established control structures that could be used at the same time.
Loneliness is a common feeling often framed in negative terms. It can take several forms, including social, emotional, and existential loneliness, or through the concept of solitude, which is the desire to be alone. This qualitative study explores these types of loneliness among Swedish parents who regret having children. Our analysis of 29 interviews shows that loneliness is intertwined with regretting parenthood. Participants perceived that parental regret was unconventional, socially taboo, and unspeakable, which resulted in feelings of loneliness, shame, and guilt. They also reported that healthcare professionals, friends, and family rarely acknowledge parental feelings of regret and loneliness. Since loneliness is associated with the potential for mental health issues, it is important to build support structures for parents. In Sweden, the welfare state relies on healthcare professionals (such as nurses, midwives, and psychologists) to support parents. There is hence a need to create better support structures for parents dealing with regret and loneliness, including specialized training for healthcare professionals who work with these vulnerable groups.
Severity of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with increased relationship distress and decreased relationship satisfaction. The loved ones of individuals with OCD often engage in family accommodation (FA) behaviors that serve the same function as compulsive behavior engaged in by the individual with OCD. The current study aims to expand the literature by examining target variables from the perspective of the individual with OCD. Participants included 139 adults with self-reported OCD who were in a romantic relationship. A treatment and non-treatment seeking sample was recruited in the US through clinics and clinicians specializing in OCD treatment. Results indicated the following: (1) a significant positive association between OCD symptom severity and FA, (2) a significant negative association between OCD symptom severity and relationship satisfaction, and (3) an interaction between FA and OCD symptom severity when predicting relationship satisfaction such that FA moderates the negative association between OCD and relationship satisfaction. At high levels of OCD symptom severity, FA was found to be negatively associated with relationship satisfaction; however, at low levels of OCD symptom severity, FA was positively associated with relationship satisfaction. Findings suggest the importance of addressing family accommodation in treatment of individuals with OCD, especially at higher levels of severity.
This article contends that Western iterations of sovereignty and its apparatuses produce, in part, souls and selves that have contributed to destructive, depersonalizing relations between human beings, other species, and the Earth. Given this, it is necessary to reimagine the notion of “soul” in relation to the idea of anarchy with the aim of creating more life-enhancing and inclusive eco-social-political relations. The underlying premise of this article is that anarchic souls are an existential reality that, in the West, have mostly been hidden, denied, or suppressed as a result of persons internalizing the philosophical and theological ideas, beliefs, and values associated with varied apparatuses of domination.
Positive paternal involvement during early childhood is important for fostering healthy development. However, mental health conditions, particularly depression, can significantly limit a father's ability to engage constructively. This study explored whether religiosity can act as a resource for fathers, potentially mitigating the adverse effects of depression on their ability to engage in their child’s life. Analyzing survey data from 1147 fathers with children aged two to eight, the study investigated the how religiosity and depression interact across four domains of paternal involvement: engagement, warmth, harsh punishment, and positive control. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that fathers with higher religiosity scores exhibited more warmth, greater engagement, and higher levels of both harsh punishment and positive control techniques. Fathers with more depression symptoms were associated with more frequent harsh punishment behaviors and lower reports of warmth compared to fathers with less depression symptoms. Notably, a significant interaction effect between depression and religiosity was identified, indicating that fathers with high levels of both depressive symptoms and religiosity were at the greatest risk of engaging in harsh punishment behaviors. These findings suggest that while religiosity may support positive parenting behaviors, it may also intensify the use of harsh punishment among fathers struggling with depression. This highlights the need for targeted interventions to help fathers manage their depression and adopt positive parenting practices.
This study empirically investigated the mechanisms underlying work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict’s effect on second-child fertility intention by focusing on parental burnout and grandparent support. A sample of 1072 Chinese respondents who had already had one child were surveyed. The results of the two-wave longitudinal study showed that both work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict exerted a significant negative effect on second-child fertility intention. Mediation path analysis revealed that both independent variables had significant positive effects on parental burnout, while parental burnout exhibited significant negative effects on the dependent variable. Subsequently, our study confirmed that parental burnout served as a mediating variable between work-to-family conflict, family-to-work conflict, and second-child fertility intention. Furthermore, grandparent support moderated only the direct positive effect of work-to-family conflict on parental burnout and the indirect effect of work-to-family conflict on second-child fertility intention via parental burnout. Thus, the indirect effect of work-to-family conflict on second-child fertility intention is weakened when grandparent support is high. The study offers implications that mitigating the negative effects of family-to-work conflict on second-child fertility intention require support not only from the micro-ecosystem of the family, but also from the meso- and macro-ecosystems, such as organizations and society.
This study examined a mentorship intervention for junior teachers (i.e., those with less than five years of experience) where junior teachers had the opportunity to meet with mentors twice daily across four weeks. Changes in junior teachers’ stress levels and sense of self-efficacy were measured. Researchers collected data from three junior teachers and mentor dyads in a Southern school district in the United States. A Concurrent Multiple Baseline Design across three teachers was used to examine the impact of the daily mentorship intervention. The results suggested that the intervention decreased all three junior teachers’ daily stress but had little impact on their overall perceived stress levels. The intervention did not impact junior teachers’ sense of self-efficacy. Most of the participants rated the intervention as feasible and acceptable. This study supports a promising novel mentorship program for decreasing junior teachers’ stress. Limitations, implications for practice, and directions for future research are discussed.
Parenting is a product of complex, interactive, and interwoven factors, which are affected by a variety of characteristics, including parent characteristics and the family environment. Such characteristics, including marital dissatisfaction and poor mental health, could place infants at an increased risk for affect regulation difficulties. The current longitudinal study extended previous research by examining how multiple factors of the parenting environment are associated with infant affect regulation with mothers and fathers. Families (n= 89, primarily White) from the Southeastern United States were assessed at 4 and 8 months of age. Parent mental health (anxiety and depression symptoms, well-being) and marital satisfaction were measured by questionnaires when infants were 4 months old. Infant affect regulation was measured via infant affect observational ratings during a face-to-face play task at 4 and 8 months of age. Mothers, who were higher in well-being, had infants lower in negative affect. Infants, whose fathers were low in social anxiety and had higher marital satisfaction, had decreased levels of negative affect. Findings provide target areas for promoting infant affect regulation, such as parent marital satisfaction and parent mental health.
Infectious diseases have been major causes of death throughout human history and are assumed to broadly affect human psychology. However, whether and how conceptual processing, an internal world model central to various cognitive processes, adapts to such salient stress variables remains largely unknown. To address this, we conducted three studies examining the relationship between pathogen severity and semantic space, probed through the main neurocognitive semantic dimensions revealed by large-scale text analyses: one cross-cultural study (across 43 countries) and two historical studies (over the past 100 years). Across all three studies, we observed that increasing pathogen severity was associated with an enhancement of the sensory-motor dimension in the collective semantic space. These patterns remained robust after controlling for the effects of sociocultural variables, including economic wealth and societal norms of tightness. These results highlight the universal dynamic mechanisms of collective semantics, such that pathogen stress potentially drives sensorially oriented semantic processing.
This study investigates the prevalence, stability, and associated factors of internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents within a clinical setting. The sample included 299 patients aged 3–17 years from a Child and Adolescent Mental Health outpatient clinic, followed over one year. Internalizing symptoms were assessed using the parent-rated version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), completed at baseline and at one-year follow-up. Stability was evaluated using prospective consistency, retrospective consistency, kappa coefficient, and Spearman’s Rho correlations. Multivariate analyses were conducted to examine associated factors. Baseline prevalence of internalizing symptoms was 40% (95% CI: 33.4-44.8%), with moderate one-year stability (ρ = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.37-0.58). Key factors associated with internalizing symptoms at follow-up included: For girls, higher baseline SDQ emotional symptoms (OR = 2.12,p< 0.001), lower paternal education (OR = 9.70,p= 0.003), and lower SDQ hyperactivity/inattention scores (OR = 0.70,p= 0.016). For boys, comorbid externalizing symptoms (OR = 8.18,p< 0.001), maternal anxiety (OR = 2.35,p= 0.031), maternal unemployment (OR = 2.13,p= 0.043), and a sibling diagnosed with ADHD (OR = 0.10,p= 0.012). For children, peer problems (OR = 1.20,p= 0.02) and the absence of an externalizing diagnosis (OR = 0.33,p= 0.013). For adolescents, lower paternal education (OR = 5.99,p= 0.003), higher SDQ emotional symptoms scores (OR = 13.48,p< 0.001), and female gender. Gender and age differences in associated factors highlight the interplay of neurobiological and social influences. These findings underscore the importance of considering gender and age-specific factors when developing preventive and therapeutic interventions for internalizing symptoms in clinical populations.
Rhythm perception in speech and non-speech acoustic stimuli has been shown to be affected by general acoustic biases as well as by phonological properties of the native language of the listener. The present paper extends the cross-linguistic approach in this field by testing the application of the iambic-trochaic law as an assumed general acoustic bias on rhythmic grouping of non-speech stimuli by speakers of three languages: Arabic, Hebrew and German. These languages were chosen due to relevant differences in their phonological properties on the lexical level alongside similarities on the phrasal level. The results show Iambic-Trochaic-Law (ITL) conforming weak–strong grouping for duration-cued acoustic salience. However, only German participants judged intensity-varying sequences as strong–weak; no grouping preferences were found for speakers of Arabic and Hebrew. Overall these results suggest that prosodic properties of the phonological phrase and of the lexical level of the native language show differing effects on rhythmical grouping.
Sociodemographic disadvantage is a stressor related with unsupportive parenting practices, but little is known about the process by which it may undermine early parental emotion socialization. In the current study, we examined (1) the direct association between sociodemographic risk and supportive emotion socialization and (2) possible indirect effects via psychological distress and mother-oriented cry processing (i.e., negative cognitions about crying) in a short-term 3-wave longitudinal study that followed a stratified sample of 259 first-time mothers from pregnancy through 14-months postpartum. Sociodemographic risk included mothers’ age, education, and income reported by the expectant mothers prenatally. Psychological distress was assessed prior to the 6-month laboratory visit using mothers’ reports on depressive symptoms, difficulty regulating emotions, and trait positive and negative emotions. During the 6-month laboratory visit, mother-oriented cry processing was assessed using a video-recall procedure. Supportive emotion socialization at 14 months was assessed based on observer-rated maternal sensitivity during two distress eliciting tasks and maternal reports. Consistent with prediction, the first indirect pathway from higher sociodemographic disadvantage to lower supportive emotional socialization through higher mother-oriented cry processing was statistically significant, however the second indirect pathway from higher sociodemographic disadvantage to higher psychological distress to higher mother-oriented cry processing to lower supportive emotion socialization was not. Over and above these indirect effects, higher sociodemographic disadvantage was directly associated with lower supportive emotion socialization. Psychological distress was not significantly directly associated with emotion socialization. These findings highlight the importance of policies and interventions that provide financial assistance to the mothers experiencing sociodemographic disadvantage and target their psychological wellbeing.
The link between parenting styles and adolescents’ cyberbullying is well-established. However, few studies have examined fathers and mothers’ parenting styles separately, and even fewer have explored the relationship between parenting styles and cyberbullying from the perspective of attitude towards human dignity. Therefore, the current cross-sectional study aimed to investigate whether attitude towards human dignity underlie the associations between parenting styles and cyberbullying among adolescents. 768 adolescents from two different middle schools in China were measured for their perceptions of parenting style, cyberbullying behavior, and attitude towards human dignity. Regression analysis showed that except for paternal overprotection, both the cognition and behavioral tendency of human dignity had a significant indirect effect on fathers’/mothers’ parenting styles and cyberbullying. Still, the emotion of human dignity had no significant indirect effect.
Theory of mind (ToM) describes a child’s ability to accurately attribute mental states to themselves and others. ToM has been conceptualized as a protective factor against psychopathology across childhood. Little is known about potential moderators of this association. For example, it is unclear whether there are subgroups of children for whom well-developed ToM plays a stronger protective role for adaptive functioning compared to other children. In a community sample of 467 children, this study examined whether child temperament assessed at age 3 years moderates the association between ToM at age 3 years and internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 5 years. We used a community detection approach to identify three distinct temperament groups: emotionally and behaviorally well-regulated (EBR), emotionally and behaviorally dysregulated (EBD), and introverted and overcontrolled (IOC). Results from moderated regression analyses suggest that social competence had a stronger protective role for the two temperament groups at elevated risk for emotional and behavioral problems, i.e., EBD and IOC. For the IOC group, greater ToM was associated with reduced externalizing symptoms. Results support the view that ToM, one aspect of social competence, may serve as a protective factor against the development of psychopathology, particularly among introverted and overcontrolled children.
BackgroundIn recent years, the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly relevant in various sectors, including higher education. This study investigates the psychosocial factors influencing AI adoption among Peruvian university students and uses an extended UTAUT2 model to examine various constructs that may impact AI acceptance and use.MethodThis study employed a quantitative approach with a survey-based design. A total of 482 students from public and private universities in Peru participated in the research. The study utilized partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the data and test the hypothesized relationships between the constructs.ResultsThe findings revealed that three out of the six hypothesized factors significantly influenced AI adoption among Peruvian university students. Performance expectancy (β = 0.274), social influence (β = 0.355), and AI learning self-efficacy (β = 0.431) were found to have significant positive effects on AI adoption. In contrast to expectations, ethical awareness, perceived playfulness, AI readiness and AI anxiety did not have significant impacts on AI appropriation in this context.ConclusionThis study highlights the importance of practical benefits, the social context, and self-confidence in the adoption of AI within Peruvian higher education. These findings contribute to the understanding of AI adoption in diverse educational settings and provide a framework for developing effective AI implementation strategies in higher education institutions. The results can guide universities and policymakers in creating targeted approaches to enhance AI adoption and integration in academic environments, focusing on demonstrating the practical value of AI, leveraging social networks, and building students’ confidence in their ability to learn and use AI technologies.
Youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at nearly twice the risk of experiencing obesity, compared to youth without ASD.WellnessEducation toCreateHealthy habits andActions toThrive (WE CHAT) is a novel chatbot that engages participants to enhance primary care delivery and associated care coordination services through mobile health (mHealth) technology focused on social determinants of health (SDOH) and social-emotional health. This study examines multiple perspectives regarding the development and implementation of innovative mHealth technology among youth with ASD. The phases of this study include (1) discussion among individuals and parents of children with ASD, (2) in-depth interviews with primary care providers (PCPs) who treat youth with ASD, and (3) in-depth interviews with interdisciplinary rehabilitation providers who treat youth with ASD. Phases 1 and 2 employed rapid qualitative analysis, and Phase 3 involved inductive thematic analysis to provide context to gaps identified in prior phases. Key themes across the three phases included thevariability of symptoms among individuals with ASD, thedifferences in perceived value of mHealth technology, theimportance of family-centered care, and therole of interdisciplinary support. Participants recommended the development of branching logic to increase the flexibility of mHealth technology designed for youth with ASD. This study gathered insight from multiple perspectives to identify opportunities for supporting independent participation in mHealth technology while reducing associated caregiver burden among youth with ASD. These findings may inform refinement and expansion of WE CHAT for patients with varying health needs.
ObjectivesThe present study tested the unique contributions of prenatal maternal mindfulness to infant emerging effortful control and negative affect at 6 months postnatal. Exploratory analyses evaluated the role of individual facets of mindfulness in predicting infant outcomes.MethodThe sample consisted of 178 individuals. Participants completed self-report measures of mindfulness during pregnancy (M= 16.91 gestational weeks;SD= 4.37) and postnatally (M= 6.54 months after birth;SD= 2.12). At 6 months postpartum, participants also reported on their infants' (55% female) emerging effortful control and negative affect using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire.ResultsGreater prenatal maternal mindfulness was associated with higher infant emerging effortful control (β= 0.40,p< 0.001) and lower negative affect (β= -0.16,p= 0.04). These relations remained statistically significant when controlling for postnatal mindfulness. The prenatal describing (β= 0.21,p= 0.02) and nonreacting (β= 0.28,p= 0.01) subscales of mindfulness were statistically significant predictors of emerging effortful control after controlling for postnatal mindfulness subscales. None of the subscales were significant predictors of infant negative affect after controlling for postnatal mindfulness.ConclusionsMaternal prenatal mindfulness predicted both infant emerging effortful control and negative affect. Individual facets of prenatal mindfulness demonstrated unique patterns of association with infant emerging effortful control, suggesting that aspects of mindfulness may be promotive factors to consider in future interventions. These findings highlight that mindfulness during pregnancy is linked to improved infant self-regulation and reduced emotional reactivity.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.
Both helping and voice are usually regarded as a positive workplace behavior that benefits organizations in various ways. It might seem that employees will receive a “double reward” from supervisors if they not only help but also voice. However, this research challenges this view. Drawing upon role incongruity theory, we propose that employees who exhibit both voice and helping behaviors are likely to receive lower performance evaluations from their supervisors than those who exhibit only one of these behaviors via affective liking. Results from a multi-source field study and a scenario-based experiment consistently provided supporting evidence that helping (or voice) promoted managerial performance evaluation only when voice (or helping) was low, in which affective liking serves as the underlying mechanism. Implications for both theory and practice were discussed.
This cross-sectional, cross-cultural study aimed to investigate the relationships between death anxiety and work passion, focusing on the dimensions of harmonious and obsessive passion, as well as the moderating roles of work centrality and connection to work. Participants included Portuguese (n= 301) and Saudi Arabian (n= 181) employees. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze these relationships. The results revealed significant differences between the two groups, with Arabian participants reporting higher levels of death anxiety, work passion, and work centrality compared to Portuguese participants. The model demonstrated an adequate fit in both cultural contexts. The results indicated that death anxiety was negatively associated with harmonious work passion and positively associated with obsessive work passion in both cultures, with these effects being more pronounced among Saudi Arabian participants. Results of moderation analysis revealed that work centrality moderated the relationship between death anxiety and harmonious work passion only in Saudi Arab sample, while connection to work moderated this relationship only in Portuguese sample. Furthermore, the results indicated that work centrality and connection to work have no moderating effects on obsessive work passion in both cultures. These findings highlight the potential influence of cultural values on attitudes toward work and the interplay between personal and professional life, shaping how individuals experience death anxiety in the workplace.
People may form impressions about different groups of people, including entrepreneurs. Drawing from the constructive and blind patriotism distinction, we suggested that demonstrating constructive, compared to blind patriotism, might improve social entrepreneurs’ authenticity and general impressions and thus positively affect success-related entrepreneurial outcomes (i.e., finding collaborators and funding). In line with our expectations, in a correlational Study 1 (N= 141), ratings of real-life social entrepreneurs on constructive patriotism positively predicted general perceptions of social entrepreneurs. We further explored these findings in twopreregisteredexperiments. In Study 2 (N= 428), participants in a constructive patriotism condition rated a fictional social entrepreneur more positively and were more willing to work for him than their counterparts in a blind patriotism condition. In Study 3 (N= 391), we found that expressions of constructive patriotism positively affected perceptions of authenticity and funding intentions. Study 3 also found evidence of a serial mediation effect: greater levels of authenticity ratings and more positive general perceptions mediated the effect of our condition on (a) intentions to work for and (b) fund the social entrepreneur. Therefore, expressions of constructive patriotism might help to manage public perceptions of social entrepreneurs.
Weight control issues are a challenge today, especially in children and adolescents. Self-efficacy may play an important role in adherence to healthy eating behaviors, and good assessment tools are required. This study aimed to both explore the implications of dietary self-efficacy on healthy eating and emotional variables and validate theChild Dietary Self-Efficacy Scalein the Spanish clinical context. A total of 151 patients aged 6 to 17 years receiving care in endocrinology units were evaluated. A third of the participants were assessed a second time. Questionnaires on self-efficacy, emotion regulation, affect, and eating behaviors were administered. Bivariate correlations, test-retest analyses, and linear regression were performed. For the first time, the scale was tested with confirmatory factor analysis. Dietary self-efficacy correlated with emotion regulation, affect, and eating behaviour, and was a predictor of later eating behaviour. Also, negative affect predicted lower dietary self-efficacy. The Spanish version of the instrument confirmed a one-factor solution. However, a more efficient 10-item version showed a better model fit. Dietary self-efficacy seems to have relevant implications for children’s emotional domains and for their adherence to healthy eating, and a valid Spanish version of the scale is now available for application in clinical contexts.
Substantial findings point to the risk of chronic pain following child maltreatment (CM). However, a coherent explanation for the mechanisms underlying pain following CM is lacking. Although peritraumatic pain may encompass a significant role in these processes, a systematic quantification of peritraumatic pain in CM has never been conducted. This study was conducted to provide an initial exploration of peritraumatic pain characteristics in CM, and its links with CM characteristics, pain expression, and later posttraumatic outcomes. Two samples of adult CM survivors (N= 160 andN= 120, respectively) filled out self-report questionnaires assessing peritraumatic pain characteristics, CM characteristics, peritraumatic dissociation, and complex posttraumatic-stress symptoms (cPTSD). Peritraumatic pain was reported by 42.2% (76 participants) and 57% (69 participants) in Samples 1 and 2, respectively. While pain was most prevalent in physical abuse (90%), it was also prevalent in sexual (63%) and emotional abuse (37.5%;X2(3) = 14.65,p= .002). Peritraumatic pain was most prevalent when the perpetrator was a family member (X2(3) = 14.65,p= .002), longer CM duration (p< .001), and in fight-or-flight peritraumatic responses (X2(2) = 7.13,p= .028). Peritraumatic pain expression did not differ for CM type (p> .083), and most participants reported that the perpetrator ignored their pain (73.9%). Explicit and concealing expressions of pain were associated with later cPTSD symptoms (p< .047). The findings provide an initial understanding of peritraumatic pain characteristics and phenomenology, demonstrating that pain is a substantial constituent of CM experiences and potential posttraumatic outcomes.
Job stress among child welfare professionals affects their mental and physical health and is associated with negative outcomes. Researchers have used self-report measures to document the stress experienced by those in the child welfare field, and this is the first study to use biometric technology across 72 h to identify physiological indicators of stress, recovery, and sleep in frontline child welfare workers in mostly rural areas (n= 32). A stress profile of the participants is presented on their heart rates, mean time-stressed, percent of time stressed, mean time relaxed, percent of time relaxed, mean sleep time, mean RMSSD in sleep, and body mass index (BMI). Variables were also examined by length of employment with the agency. Results indicate participants averaged nearly 16 h of physiological stress per day and were unable to spend much time in relaxation or recovery from stress. Stress appeared ubiquitous and possibly difficult to manage.
Guardians ad Litem (GALs) are volunteer child advocates in the state of Florida and are largely considered as playing a critical role in the child welfare system. However, there has been limited research on their role and relationship with youth in care. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine GALs’ perspectives on their relationships with youth in the foster care system. This cross-sectional study included 555 GALs from the state of Florida in which volunteers were specifically asked to respond to an internet survey with a number of open-ended questions about their relationships with youth and how relationships developed with youth in foster care. Emergent themes related to the process of relationship building, as well as factors that influence their relationships with youth and strategies for building relationships were identified. Implications and recommendations for future research with child advocates and youth in foster care, training and support of advocates, and child welfare practice and policy are discussed.
The quality of mother-child interactions can affect child developmental outcomes, both positively and negatively. Little research has examined the factors that influence the quality of mother-infant interactions, particularly in a low-middle income country. Therefore, we examined sociodemographic, maternal, and child variables, to determine whether these were associated with the quality of maternal-infant interactions. 256 mother-infant dyads enrolled in a South African birth cohort study, the Drakenstein Child Health Study, were assessed. A comprehensive battery of sociodemographic and psychosocial questionnaires was utilised. Video footage of interaction between mothers and infants at a 14-week postnatal visit was coded and assessed using the Global Rating Scale (GRS). Hierarchical multiple linear regression models were used to examine the factors associated with the GRS domains. The domains included: (1) maternal sensitivities (sensitivity, intrusiveness, remoteness, depressive mood), (2) infant behaviours (sensitivity, inertness, distress), and (3) maternal-infant interaction. Maternal childhood trauma and smoking during pregnancy were associated with lower domain scores for the maternal contribution. Higher birth weight and initiated breastfeeding were associated with higher domain scores for infant behaviours, while maternal IPV exposure, and smoking tobacco were associated with lower domain scores for infant behaviours. Infant weight-for-age at birth and initiated breastfeeding were positively associated with the dyadic interaction. Factors associated with early positive and negative mother-infant interaction identified in this research could potentially serve as targets for intervention, with the ultimate aim of improving child developmental outcomes. Notably, no psychosocial variables were significantly associated with the dyadic interactions, emphasising how strong such interactions can be in the face of multiple stressors.
The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) was originally developed to evaluate interventions, and is a well-established assessment tool for challenging behaviours in people with intellectual disabilities and autistic people. However, whether the ABC displays longitudinal measurement invariance (i.e., whether it captures the same constructs over time) has been sparsely explored. The aim of the current study is to explore the factor structure, longitudinal measurement invariance, and clinical correlates of the ABC in autistic individuals with intellectual disabilities. Using data from a multicentre study of mental health assessment and treatment in autistic people with intellectual disabilities, the intake ABC scores of 200 autistic individuals with intellectual disabilities were used to explore the ABC factor structure, internal consistency, and clinical correlates (age, gender, level of intellectual disability, autism characteristics, communication skills). Scores across three time points (intake, post-intervention, follow-up) were used to explore longitudinal measurement invariance and internal consistency over time. The original five-factor structure showed a non-optimal but acceptable fit, which was similar or slightly improved compared to previous studies. Associations for some ABC subscales were found to be positive for autism characteristics and negative for communication skills. Four of the five subscales (irritability, social withdrawal, stereotypic behaviour, inappropriate speech) showed residual levels of longitudinal measurement invariance, while one subscale showed noninvariance (hyperactivity/noncompliance). The current study demonstrates the construct validity and applicability of the ABC in autistic individuals with intellectual disabilities, while also indicating that caution is advised for one of its subscales in comparisons across time.
Adopting a family system perspective, this study sets out to explore the association between family configurations of mother-child and father-child attachment to better understand children’s externalizing and internalizing behaviors in toddlerhood. A total of 182 heterosexual biparental families and their children (90 boys) were recruited from the general population. Most of the fathers and mothers were Canadian-born and the personal income and education level of the parents were high in comparison to the population of the province of Quebec at large. Attachment was assessed by direct observation using the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) in infants aged 12–18 months. Children’s internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed in toddlers aged 24–30 months using questionnaires completed by both parents. Results showed that infants with resistant attachment to one parent and secure attachment to the other parent have more externalizing behaviors than children with a secure attachment to both parents. Moreover, children with a disorganized attachment to both parents showed more internalizing and externalizing problems than children with a disorganized attachment with one parent and secure with the other parent. These results highlight the need of adopting a systemic family perspective to better understand the link between attachment and children’s behavior problems.
Teachers are leaving the field at high rates, and it is important to investigate factors that impact teacher attrition including stress and burnout. In a sample of 468 teachers, 78% of teachers had thoughts of leaving or were leaving the field. Teachers were asked about their stress, coping, burnout, and efficacy with classroom management. Overall, teachers reported high levels of stress and burnout associated with their job. Teachers with high efficacy had lower burnout and reported higher ability to cope with their job. Experienced teachers had higher efficacy but also had higher burnout and were more likely to report having thoughts of leaving the field. Lastly, stress and burnout predicted intentions to leave the field above and beyond efficacy or coping. Qualitative data indicated that lack of administrative support, followed by being overworked, underpaid, and challenging student behaviors were some of the top reasons for those not returning to teaching. Teacher stress, burnout, and attrition impact student social, emotional and academic outcomes. Implications for practice and policy are discussed.
The current study tests the implications of men’s and women’s gender-related attitudes for relationship quality and wellbeing. We apply ambivalent sexism theory to differentiate between attitudes that should have detrimental versus beneficial effects for relationships by promoting antagonism (hostile sexism) versus complimentary relational roles (benevolent sexism) between men and women. Actor-partner interdependence analyses of heterosexual couples participating in a nationally representative panel study (N= 755) revealed that men’s hostile sexism predicted greater relationship conflict and lower relationship satisfaction, which in turn were associated with greater psychological distress and lower wellbeing for both men and their women partners. In contrast, men’s benevolent sexism predicted lower relationship conflict and greater satisfaction, which in turn was associated with lower distress and greater wellbeing for men but not women partners. Women’s sexist attitudes had differential effects. Women’s hostile sexism predicted lower relationship conflict and greater satisfaction, which was associated with higher wellbeing for men partners. In contrast, women’s benevolent sexism predicted greater relationship conflict, which related to greater distress and lower wellbeing for women and men partners. These results highlight the importance of gender-related attitudes on relationship quality, which has important implications for wellbeing.
There is a substantial time gap between when parents develop concerns about their child (ages 1–2) and when they receive a diagnosis of autism (ages 3–5), delaying the onset of critical interventions. Few studies have examined how the timing, type, and quantity of early parental concerns are associated with age of diagnosis. The aims of this study were to describe characteristics of parents’ concerns in a large community-based sample and explore how characteristics of concerns relate to age of diagnosis. This study included 853 parents of 2- to 5-year-old children with an autism diagnosis. Parents completed an online survey including questions regarding their child’s age when they first became concerned about their development, what their first concern was, all concerns they have had about their child, and age of diagnosis. An earlier age at first concern and the presence of several specific types of concerns (i.e., delayed/absence response to name, reduced eye contact, developmental regression, delayed gesture development, limited emotional response) were found to be significant predictors of earlier age at diagnosis. In addition, when accounting for age of first concern and the presence of specific types of concerns, a higher number of concerns was associated with a later age of diagnosis. Several specific types of concerns significantly predict the age at diagnosis, although several of these specific types are not commonly reported by parents. Educating parents and pediatricians about these concerns may improve early detection and intervention, ultimately improving long-term outcomes for children and families.
How do people model the world’s dynamics to guide mental simulation and evaluate choices? One prominent approach, the Successor Representation (SR), takes advantage of temporal abstraction of future states: by aggregating trajectory predictions over multiple timesteps, the brain can avoid the costs of iterative, multi-step mental simulation. Human behavior broadly shows signatures of such temporal abstraction, but finer-grained characterization of individuals’ strategies and their dynamic adjustment remains an open question. We developed a task to measure SR usage during dynamic, trial-by-trial learning. Using this approach, we find that participants exhibit a mix of SR and model-based learning strategies that varies across individuals. Further, by dynamically manipulating the task contingencies within-subject to favor or disfavor temporal abstraction, we observe evidence of resource-rational reliance on the SR, which decreases when future states are less predictable. Our work adds to a growing body of research showing that the brain arbitrates between approximate decision strategies. The current study extends these ideas from simple habits into usage of more sophisticated approximate predictive models, and demonstrates that individuals dynamically adapt these in response to the predictability of their environment.
BackgroundFamily involvement in youth care and special education is referred to as family-centered practice (FCP). Research on FCP, for example in relation to the effectiveness of youth care and special education, is challenged by a lack of validated instruments that measure youth professionals’ family-centered attitudes and actions that is applicable across multiple settings and professions in youth care and special education.ObjectiveThe overall aim of the current study was to develop and empirically evaluate a comprehensive, multi-dimensional measure to assess family centered practice in residential youth care: the 40-item Family-Centered Attitudes and Actions Scale (FAAS).MethodsWe developed the 40-item FAAS in collaboration with field experts, using our systematic review on FCP in residential youth care as the foundation for the scale. Youth professionals in various Dutch welfare settings (N = 279) completed the FAAS. We used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to adjust the scale until we established satisfactory model fit and analyzed the psychometric properties of the adjusted scale.ResultsCFA confirmed the four proposed dimensions: Whole Family Empowerment, Shared Decision-Making Analysis, Parent-Child Contact, and Family-Staff Alliance. The adjusted 27-item FAAS shows sufficient internal consistency and convergent validity, correlating positively with professionals’ self-efficacy and organizational support regarding the implementation FCP.ConclusionsOur findings provide initial evidence that the 27-item FAAS is an internally consistent measure of youth professionals’ family-centered attitudes and actions and show preliminary evidence of convergent validity. The FAAS has the potential to contribute to knowledge about the effectiveness of FCP in youth care and special education.
ObjectivesThis study investigated the effect of mindfulness induction on attentional control in emotional contexts and explored whether the timing of emotional information modulated these effects.MethodA total of 323 undergraduate students participated in the study, completing a Stroop task where a task-irrelevant emotional face (neutral, happy, or angry) either preceded the Stroop target (prime condition or prime; Experiment 1) or appeared simultaneously with it (concurrent condition or concur; Experiment 2). Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: the Mindfulness Induction group in Experiment 1 (MI-Prime), the Waitlist Control group in Experiment 1 (WLC-Prime), the Mindfulness Induction group in Experiment 2 (MI-Concur), and the Waitlist Control group in Experiment 2 (WLC-Concur). The Stroop interference effect served as the measure of attentional control.ResultsA mixed-measures ANOVA showed a significant group effect, with lower attentional control observed in the MI-Prime group compared to the MI-Concur group, and in the WLC-Prime group compared to the WLC-Concur group. A significant interaction effect between group and emotions indicated that task-irrelevant emotional faces influenced attentional control differently within the WLC groups. However, in the MI groups, emotional faces did not modulate attentional control. The four groups were comparable in terms of trait mindfulness, emotional states, and affect.ConclusionThe timing of emotional information modulated attentional control irrespective of mindfulness induction. These findings support previous research on the cognitive benefits of mindfulness, even with brief, single-session practices lasting just a few minutes.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.
Existing research has shown that emotional intelligence (EI) and teacher self-efficacy (TSE) play an important role in the work of in-service teachers. However, there is limited research on these variables and their associations among pre-service teachers. Also, the cultural context is expected to influence EI and TSE. Therefore, this study examined the associations between EI and TSE in two cultures, Finland and Greece. A comprehensive evaluation of EI was done by including both trait EI and ability EI measures. Data from primary education student teachers from Finland (N= 82) and Greece (N= 117) were collected online. The measures of EI and TSE exhibited full configural and metric measurement invariance and partial scalar and residual/strict measurement invariance across cultures. Finnish students had significantly higher scores on all EI variables than Greek students, whereas Greek students scored higher on self-efficacy for student engagement. Structural equation modelling showed that trait EI was moderately associated with one facet of ability EI, namely emotional management, but not with emotional understanding, implying that trait EI and ability EI can be considered as partially distinct constructs. A statistically significant positive association between trait EI and TSE was found in Finland, whereas a statistically significant negative association between ability EI and TSE was found in Greece. The findings have important implications for the models of trait and ability EI, for understanding the links between trait and ability EI and TSE during the critical phase of teacher education in the two cultural contexts studied, and for culturally informed teacher education.
The rising prevalence of Large-Language Model-based AI Services (LLMAIs) underscores the importance of understanding users’ self-efficacy and specific needs in engaging with these technologies. Such insights are pivotal for evaluating LLMAI instructional effectiveness and guiding future developments of these technologies. However, current instruments fail to adequately capture these aspects. The study aimed to develop and validate the Questionnaire of Self-efficacy and Needs in using core features of LLMAIs (Q-SNELL). The Q-SNELL was developed through an extensive review of LLMAI core features. Its validation involved content and face validity assessments with a diverse group of experts and common users. Convergent validity, known-groups validity, and test-retest reliability were further evaluated through first and second round online surveys completed by users of LLMAIs. The Q-SNELL comprises three parts: the first focuses on self-efficacy and needs related to the eight core features of LLMAIs; the second includes two items identifying the most frequently used features; and the third assesses general self-efficacy. Content validity showed high agreement (76–100%), while face validity was also strong (80–100%), except for the ease of responding to the scale design (59% and 68% agreement). Validation with 398 participants showed mixed outcomes for convergent validity, strong support for known-groups validity, and moderate to high test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.47 to 0.74). The Q-SNELL is a pioneering instrument measuring users’ self-efficacy and needs regarding LLMAIs’ 8 core features and general usage. Its flexible structure allows for selective application of specific items, tailored to the needs of researchers.
Brand storytelling, as an important communication method for conveying and shaping brand perception and brand image, has been applied more and more widely in recent years in corporate marketing and management, among other aspects. This study investigates the effect of brand stories of agricultural products on consumers’ purchase intention, and also examines the conditions under which they are applicable. Through three experiments, this study found that brand stories increase consumers’ willingness to buy agricultural products, and the sales method plays a moderating role in this. Emotional stories increase consumers’ purchase intention when the sales method is individual sales, and experiential stories increase consumers’ purchase intention when the sales method is chain store sales. The findings of this study enrich the branding theory and are of great significance in shaping the brand image of agricultural products.
The current study aimed to investigate the link between masculine gender-role discrepancy and life satisfaction among men, focusing on the underlying mechanism. Specifically, it examined the mediating role of masculine discrepancy stress in the association between masculine gender-role discrepancy and men’s life satisfaction. Additionally, it investigated the moderating role of adherence to traditional masculinity ideology in the association between masculine gender-role discrepancy and masculine discrepancy stress, and the moderating role of self-compassion in the association between masculine discrepancy stress and men’s life satisfaction. For the present study, 831 Israeli men completed self-report questionnaires. The findings suggest that masculine gender-role discrepancy both directly and indirectly predicts men’s life satisfaction (via masculine discrepancy stress). Additionally, while adherence to traditional masculinity ideology moderated the positive association between masculine gender-role discrepancy and masculine discrepancy stress, self-compassion moderated the negative association between masculine discrepancy stress and men’s life satisfaction. This study demonstrated how aspects of masculinity are linked to men’s life satisfaction. Furthermore, it underscored self-compassion as a psychological resource that acts as a buffer against the detrimental impact of masculine discrepancy stress on men’s life satisfaction. Therefore, professionals are urged to encourage men to use self-compassion to maintain or enhance their life satisfaction.
This paper highlights the idea that people who have experienced unfair treatment tend to develop anticipatory injustice (i.e., expectations of unfairness in a new context). Specifically, it argues that citizens who have experienced unfair treatment in education are more likely to have a sense of powerlessness toward their own political abilities (internal political efficacy) and toward the political system (external political efficacy). Using data from the European Social Survey 2018, the paper shows that citizens who have not had a fair chance of achieving their desired educational goals express a weaker sense of political efficacy and that the negative effect of unfair treatment in education on external political efficacy (i.e., attitude toward the system) is more pronounced in countries with more responsive political systems. These findings suggest that previous unfair treatment in education can make citizens more cynical and frustrated about the responsiveness of their government, particularly in countries with higher levels of political responsiveness, where citizens with unfair educational opportunities perceive that they are unfairly disadvantaged and under-resourced (in terms of knowledge, skills, and dispositions) compared to their advantaged counterparts with whom they compete for government attention and responsiveness.
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have a powerful impact on adolescents’ development. The greater the number of stressful life events experienced, the more likely adolescents are to experience internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety. Due to the negative effects of early adversity, it is essential that research examine which protective factors might mitigate this relationship, such as emotion regulation (ER) and attachment. In the current study, the researchers examined the relationships between ACEs, ER, attachment, and anxiety among adolescents. We hypothesized that ER would mediate the relationship between ACEs and anxiety and attachment would moderate the relationship between ACEs and ER within the mediation model. A sample of adolescents (n= 105) completed measures of adolescent anxiety, ACEs, ER, and attachment. Using the PROCESS macro, a moderated mediation model was analyzed. Mother and father attachment moderated the mediation of difficulties in ER on ACEs and anxiety, suggesting that mean levels of mother and higher levels of father attachment function as a mechanism that strengthens the relationship between early negative life events and current anxiety. These findings suggest that the mother/father attachment relationship for adolescents might be of particular importance for youth who have experienced adverse life experiences and have trouble regulating their emotions.
Previous research has shown that children and youth with disabilities have a higher risk of being victims of sexual violence than their peers without disabilities. However, robust evidence on sexual victimization processes remains scarce and often plagued by inconsistent findings. This review aimed to synthesize research on sexual violence of children and youth with disabilities, namely the rates of sexual violence, risk factors, and characteristics of victims, environment, and perpetrators. A systematic search was conducted using the EBSCO, Web of Science, PubMed, PsycInfo, and Sage databases. Twelve studies were included for review using PRISMA guidelines. Findings from this systematic review clearly showed that sexual violence is a serious problem for children and youth with disabilities and a widespread public health concern, particularly young girls and those with intellectual disabilities. Social isolation, care needs, dependence on others, environments with restrictive routines, relational inequalities, and belonging to a family with adverse or dysfunctional characteristics were the main risk factors highlighted by the studies reviewed. This review suggested that perpetrators of sexual violence are mostly male, namely professional caregivers, teachers, peers, and family members, with a great heterogeneity regarding the types of abusive behaviors and settings where they occur. To improve prevention and intervention strategies in the field of sexual violence against children and youth with disabilities, more research is needed, particularly on risk and protective factors, as well as on predictors of potential victimization.
Previous research has suggested that numerosity estimation and counting are closely related to distributed and focused attention, respectively (Chong & Evans,WIREs Cognitive Science,2(6), 634–638,2011). Given the critical role of color in guiding attention, this study investigated its effects on numerosity processing by manipulating both color variety (single color, medium variety, high variety) and spatial arrangement (clustered, random). Results from the estimation task revealed that high color variety led to a perceptual bias towards larger quantities, regardless of whether colors were clustered or randomly arranged. This implies that distributed attention may engage in a global assessment of color richness, with less emphasis on spatial arrangement. In contrast, the effect of color on counting was influenced by spatial arrangement: performance improved with clustered colors but declined with random color distribution. This indicates that color interacts with spatial information to modulate focused attention during serial numerosity processing. Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the interaction between numerical cognition and attention, highlighting the need for theories and models of numerical cognition to take into account feature variety and contextual factors, such as the spatial arrangement of features. Additionally, in light of the widespread diversity in real-world environments, our findings could inform strategies to enhance behavioral adaptation to varying environmental conditions.
This pilot study evaluated the outcomes associated with a training workshop in cognitive-behavioural therapy with exposure and response prevention (ERP) for youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) aimed at improving clinicians’ capabilities and motivations. Questionnaires and role-plays were completed by 17 Australian clinicians working across community youth (i.e., child and adolescent) mental health services. Knowledge, beliefs, and confidence in using ERP, and adherence delivering it improved at post-training. At 6-month follow-up improvements in beliefs were not maintained, while competence delivering ERP improved. At pre-training, participants utilised ERP significantly less than they intended to. At follow-up, the proportion of time clinicians intended to dedicate to and self-reported time spent implementing ERP was unchanged relative to pre-training, and the intention-behaviour gap remained. Overall, training was associated with improvements in implementation capabilities, but the association with improvements in motivations and behaviour was less clear. Future research should explore the impact of implementation opportunities and develop strategies to support training.
Humans are inherently social beings and are often subject to social influence, a phenomenon known as conformity. But what traits characterize individuals who conform to group opinions? We aimed to examine the potential impact of religiosity and religious fundamentalism on conformity. With the growth of technology, many decisions are now made online, such as during video meetings. This shift prompted us to investigate online conformity in a pre-registered study. To measure conformity, we adapted Asch’s paradigm, using actors in an online video meeting to perform a simple perceptual task based on the classic line-length procedure. Our study focused on two constructs: (1) centrality of religiosity across its dimensions and (2) religious fundamentalism. We hypothesized that higher religiosity and higher levels of religious fundamentalism would be associated with greater online conformity. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that religious fundamentalism positively correlated with online conformity, whereas centrality of religiosity showed no relationship with conformity in the online setting.
In over 30 US states since early this century, behavior analysts have worked for months and years to secure laws to license behavior analysts. At present, very few published accounts exist to document those efforts and to provide models and recommendations for behavior analysts who are interested in advocating for licensure or some form of governmental regulation of behavior analysts. Many are well-prepared in behavior analysis but have little preparation for dealing effectively with the contingencies and procedures involved in making public policies. We provide an account of the extended, complicated efforts by behavior analysts in one state that culminated in establishment of state licensure of behavior analysts. Key activities described here include foundational organizational work by a state behavior analysis organization, preliminary licensure efforts, educating behavior analysts on public policy advocacy, establishing relationships with legislators and their staff as well as government regulatory agency personnel, developing of important alliances with various stakeholders, and review of final successful efforts. Successful efforts and lessons learned are reviewed.
The purpose of this exploratory study was to first examine the dyadic trajectory of attachment change over a longer period (i.e., 5 years) than has been examined in previous research; second, to identify a mean trajectory of attachment security for couples with no history of contact with therapy as well as the effect of therapy utilization; and third, to examine couples’ attachment trajectories for gender differences. This study included 294 heterosexual married couples (78.6% European American). One-hundred and nine (37.07%) female partners and 121 (46.60%) male partners indicated that they had never utilized therapy prior to the study or during the study (had never utilized therapy at all). Research questions were explored using dyadic longitudinal multilevel modeling with pre-existing data. Results indicate overall that couples in this sample were low on attachment insecurity at the start of data collection and became slightly more insecure over a five-year span at a statistically significant, but likely unnoticeable rate. Couples withno therapy use-everbegan the study with low attachment insecurity and remained relatively secure throughout the study. Couples whoconsistently received therapybefore and during the study reported the highest levels of insecure attachment and increased in insecurity at a faster rate in comparison to those who had never attended therapy. Males who received consistent therapy before and during the study also demonstrated significantly greater attachment insecurity than their female partners. Therapy that does not specifically focus on attachment related issues is not likely to alter attachment styles. Clinicians may wish to investigate partners’ attachment histories, including complications from trauma or abuse, and tailor treatment to attachment related issues if attachment style change is a treatment goal. Future research could examine attachment change over time for couples of lower income, more diverse racial stratification, and experiencing greater relationship distress.
While numerous reviews have assessed the association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and various mental and physical health outcomes, a comprehensive evaluation of the scope, validity, and quality of evidence is lacking. Here we present an umbrella review of a wide range of health outcomes following TBI and outline outcome risks across subpopulations. On 17 May 2023, we searched Embase, Medline, Global Health, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We compared risk ratios across different outcomes for risks compared with people without TBI and examined study quality, including heterogeneity, publication bias, and prediction intervals. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023432255). We identified 24 systematic reviews and meta-analyses covering 24 health outcomes in 31,397,958 participants. The current evidence base indicates an increased risk of multiple mental and physical health outcomes, including psychotic disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, suicide, and depression. Three outcomes—dementia, violence perpetration, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis—had meta-analytical evidence of at least moderate quality, which suggest targets for more personalized assessment. Health-care services should review how to prevent adverse long-term outcomes in TBI.
The complex interplay between low- and high-level mechanisms governing our visual system can only be fully understood within ecologically valid naturalistic contexts. For this reason, in recent years, substantial efforts have been devoted to equipping the scientific community with datasets of realistic images normed on semantic or spatial features. Here, we introduce VISIONS, an extensive database of 1136 naturalistic scenes normed on a wide range of perceptual and conceptual norms by 185 English speakers across three levels of granularity: isolated object, whole scene, and object-in-scene. Each naturalistic scene contains a critical object systematically manipulated and normed regarding its semantic consistency (e.g., atoothbrushvs. aflashlightin a bathroom) and spatial position (i.e., left, right). Normative data are also available for low- (i.e., clarity, visual complexity) and high-level (i.e., name agreement, confidence, familiarity, prototypicality, manipulability) features of the critical object and its embedding scene context. Eye-tracking data during a free-viewing task further confirms the experimental validity of our manipulations while theoretically demonstrating that object semantics is acquired in extra-foveal vision and used to guide early overt attention. To our knowledge, VISIONS is the first database exhaustively covering norms about integrating objects in scenes and providing several perceptual and conceptual norms of the two as independently taken. We expect VISIONS to become an invaluable image dataset to examine and answer timely questions above and beyond vision science, where a diversity of perceptual, attentive, mnemonic, or linguistic processes could be explored as they develop, age, or become neuropathological.
Small animal phobia (SAP) is a subtype of specific phobia characterized by an intense and irrational fear of small animals, which has been underexplored in the neuroscientific literature. Previous studies often faced limitations, such as small sample sizes, focusing on only one neuroimaging modality, and reliance on univariate analyses, which produced inconsistent findings. This study was designed to overcome these issues by using for the first time advanced multivariate machine-learning techniques to identify the neural mechanisms underlying SAP. Specifically, we relied on the multimodal Canonical Correlation Analysis approach combined with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to decompose the structural magnetic resonance images from 122 participants into covarying gray and white matter networks. Stepwise logistic regression and boosted decision trees were then used to extract a predictive model of SAP. Our results indicate that four covarying gray and white matter networks, IC19, IC14, IC21, and IC13, were critical in classifying SAP individuals from control subjects. These networks included brain regions, such as the Middle Temporal Gyrus, Precuneus, Insula, and Anterior Cingulate Cortex—all known for their roles in emotional regulation, cognitive control, and sensory processing. To test the generalizability of our results, we additionally ran a supervised machine-learning model (boosted decision trees), which achieved an 83.3% classification accuracy, with AUC of 0.9, indicating good predictive power. These findings provide new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of SAP and suggest potential biomarkers for diagnosing and treating this condition. The study offers a more nuanced understanding of SAP, with implications for future research and clinical applications in anxiety disorders.
A child’s social skills development is crucial, but social functioning deficits are common. Social impairment has been associated with various risk factors, including child anxiety symptoms and parenting practices, specifically among parents who experience distress. Given the impact that anxiety and parental distress have on social functioning, it is important to examine child characteristics that could mitigate the impact. Research has identified child characteristics (i.e., leadership, functional communication, adaptive skills, executive functioning, and emotional self-control) that promote social functioning and could serve as protective factors. The present study examined the protective effects of these child characteristics on the relation between parental distress and post-treatment anxiety of children who participated in the Resilience Builder Program® (RBP; Alvord et al.,2011). The RBP is a resilience-based cognitive-behavioral group treatment for children with social impairments. A total of 76 parents completed measures before and after the RBP, providing information on parent’s self-report of psychological distress, child anxiety, and the identified child characteristics (Mage= 10.01,SD= 1.44; 77.6% White; 81.6% male). Moderation analyses indicated that for children with poor pre-treatment functioning in adaptive skills, functional communication, and leadership, parent psychological distress was related to increased post-treatment anxiety, whereas, for strong pre-treatment skills, a negative relation was detected. Results suggest that proficiency in adaptability, functional communication, and leadership may act as a protective factor from parental distress by promoting positive treatment outcomes. Such findings could inform future interventions where these skills are emphasized during a child’s treatment if the parent indicates high distress.
Humans perceive discrete events such as “restaurant visits” and “train rides” in their continuous experience. One important prerequisite for studying human event perception is the ability of researchers to quantify when one event ends and another begins. Typically, this information is derived by aggregating behavioral annotations from several observers. Here, we present an alternative computational approach where event boundaries are derived using a large language model, GPT-3, instead of using human annotations. We demonstrate that GPT-3 can segment continuous narrative text into events. GPT-3-annotated events are significantly correlated with human event annotations. Furthermore, these GPT-derived annotations achieve a good approximation of the “consensus” solution (obtained by averaging across human annotations); the boundaries identified by GPT-3 are closer to the consensus, on average, than boundaries identified by individual human annotators. This finding suggests that GPT-3 provides a feasible solution for automated event annotations, and it demonstrates a further parallel between human cognition and prediction in large language models. In the future, GPT-3 may thereby help to elucidate the principles underlying human event perception.
Psychological science views anger as a normal, natural emotion that can be both adaptive and maladaptive, depending on how it is experienced, expressed, and managed. As a critical emotional experience, anger requires attention to both its causes and consequences to maintain optimal psychological well-being. While anger can sometimes motivate action, it often leads to negative emotional reactions and reinforces aggressive behaviors. Shantideva’s teachings in theBodhicharyāvatāraoffer a radical alternative perspective, emphasizing patience as a transformative response to anger and other adversities. He presents patience not as passive resignation, but as a dynamic and powerful tool for overcoming suffering, fostering empathy, and cultivating compassion. This shift in perspective offers significant psychological benefits, including improved emotional regulation, reduced stress, and healthier interpersonal relationships. In both formal and informal mindfulness practices, patience is operationalized as a pause between a stimulus and a response. This pause grounds the individual in the present moment, creating space to cultivate self-awareness and gain insight into habitual patterns of behavior. It also provides an opportunity to choose how to respond, rather than to react impulsively. Shantideva’s teachings offer practical tools for transforming anger into compassion, providing a profound framework for psychological well-being and interpersonal harmony.
ObjectivesRumination is a transdiagnostic risk factor for the development and maintenance of psychological distress. Mindfulness, defined as nonjudgmental regulation of attention to the present moment, is effective at reducing rumination. However, the exact mechanisms through which mindfulness reduces rumination are not well understood. This study aimed to explore whether attention control mediated the effect of a brief, app-based mindfulness intervention on reductions in rumination.MethodWe randomly assigned 77 college students with high levels of rumination to a brief, 2-week mindfulness intervention or an active control intervention. Participants completed self-report measures of mindfulness (specifically nonjudgment), rumination, and two attention control tasks (antisaccade and emotional go/no-go) at pre- and post-intervention.ResultsOur results showed a significant reduction in rumination and a significant increase in mindfulness scores from pre- to post-intervention across both groups. There was also a significant Time × Condition interaction for emotional go/no-go commission errors such that the mindfulness group experienced a decrease in commission errors (i.e., an improvement in attention control) while the control group experienced no change. Lastly, accuracy scores from the antisaccade task increased from pre- to post-intervention across both conditions.ConclusionsResults revealed that the brief mindfulness intervention improved attention control via the emotional go/no-go task, relative to the control condition. Surprisingly, both groups showed improvements in mindfulness, rumination, and antisaccade accuracy scores. These findings add to past research showing that mindfulness interventions improve certain aspects of attention control. Future work is needed to delineate the role of attention control in mindfulness interventions and how this relationship impacts psychological distress.PreregistrationThis study was a Phase 1 clinical trial and not preregistered.
ObjectivesConcerns about the mental health and well-being of K-12 schoolteachers (individuals teaching children aged 5–18 in traditional classroom settings in the USA) have never been more urgent, with stress levels, burnout, and rates of attrition reaching historically high levels. Mindfulness training may be a professional development option for teachers to better meet the demands of their career with skills such as mental flexibility, emotion regulation, resilience, empathy, compassion, and interpersonal skills. This study examined the efficacy of the Mindfulness for Humans (MfH) course, an online, self-directed mindfulness curriculum that is grounded in evidence-based practices, is easily accessible and scalable and relatively brief, and requires little or no work on the part of the school system to implement.MethodWe utilized a randomized waitlist-controlled trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of the MfH course on the well-being and mindfulness skills of 230 K-12 teachers of regular classrooms using responses to self-report measures and a satisfaction questionnaire (Group 1,n= 115; Group 2,n= 115).ResultsOnline mindfulness training through the MfH course significantly increased teacher well-being and mindfulness skills compared to a waitlist group (d= 0.28 to 0.58) regardless of initial familiarity with mindfulness practices. Participants reported that the curriculum was engaging and useful.ConclusionsOnline mindfulness training through the MfH course appears to support the well-being of K-12 schoolteachers. Future research may examine additional outcomes such as teacher stress, resilience, or psychological distress.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.
Parental psychological control is an emotionally manipulative parenting behavior that is used to control adolescents’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Such control is associated with problematic behaviors among adolescents. Less research has examined adolescents’ beliefs about parental motivations for using psychological control or the moderating role of such beliefs on associations between psychological control and adolescents’ problematic behaviors. We analyzed data from 406 US adolescents (ages 11–19) who completed school-based surveys (2020) assessing sociodemographics, parental psychological control, adolescents’ beliefs about parental motivations for using psychological control, and adolescents’ problematic behaviors (i.e., substance use, risky cyber behaviors, over- and under-eating behaviors, depressive and anxiety symptoms, delinquency, physical and relational aggression). Participants (Mage= 15.00 [SD = 1.64], 57.6% female, 85.7% White, 5.2% Black, 2.0% Asian, 1.5% Hispanic) who reported greater maternal and paternal psychological control were more likely to engage in a range of problematic behaviors. Adolescents most commonly indicated that their mothers and fathers used psychological control to keep them safe, to control their thoughts, feelings, or behaviors, and because they perceive it to be a normative parenting behavior. Adolescents’ beliefs about their mothers’ and fathers’ motivations for using psychological control were associated with adolescents’ problematic behaviors. These beliefs also moderated associations among psychological control and problematic behaviors. Findings suggest that psychological control is differentially associated with adolescents’ problematic behaviors based on their beliefs about why their parents engage in this control. Findings highlight the importance of considering adolescents as active participants in the parenting process. Findings provide potentially important individual-level targets for intervention.
PurposeThe purpose of this study was to use the advanced technique of Network Intervention Analysis (NIA) to investigate the trajectory of symptom change associated with the effects of self-control training on youth university students’ chronic ego depletion aftereffects.MethodsThe nine nodes of chronic ego depletion aftereffects and integrated self-control training were taken as nodes in the network and analyzed using NIA. Networks were computed at the baseline, at the end of treatment, at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow up. 62 samples were recruited from universities and randomly divided into two groups. The sample ranged in age from 18 to 25 years and included both males and females.ResultsSelf-control training interventions directly improved the states of low self-efficacy, low adherence, and work burnout, as well as indirectly alleviated fatigue, emotional regulation disorders, and other issues. Follow-up surveys showed that the intervention not only had immediate effects but also had long-term effects.ConclusionThese findings indicate that self-control training has a direct intervention effect on low self-efficacy, low adherence, and work burnout of youth university students’ ego depletion aftereffects. This study is the first application of NIA in abnormal psychological state intervention research outside the field of mental disorder treatment. NIA is a promising method to evaluate the trajectories of intervention change and the direct and indirect effects of training interventions.Clinical trial registrationNo. KY20202063-F-2; date of approval: 10th December, 2020.
BackgroundOrganizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is a non-compulsory but beneficial behavior for effective organizational operation. OCB can be largely determined by the type of leadership style, among which responsible leadership has been attracting considerable attention in the organizational context nowadays. The objective of this study was to examine the parallel mediating effect of gratitude and organizational identification between responsible leadership and OCB among the academic staff in China.MethodsThis study employed a cross-sectional design by distributing self-administrative questionnaires to 317 faculty members from higher education institutions in China. SmartPLS 4.0 statistical software was employed to perform Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling, in which hypotheses were tested.ResultsThe findings indicated that responsible leadership had a positive direct relationship with employees’ gratitude and organizational identification but not with OCB. Meanwhile, gratitude and organizational identification were found to improve OCB significantly. Furthermore, the results revealed that gratitude and organizational identification functioned as mediators between responsible leadership and OCB.ConclusionsThis study theoretically expanded existing research by employing a parallel mediation model between responsible leadership and OCB within an Asian higher education setting. Moreover, this study also presented practical suggestions for management and policymakers to devise strategies that can cultivate responsible leadership in higher education institutions to enhance employees’ gratitude and organizational identification, ultimately promoting OCB.
Social media users often fail to control their social media use when it disturbs with other daily goals (e.g., study, work, chores). Previous studies have demonstrated the negative impact of social media self-control failure on wellbeing, but the mechanism underlying the negative impact remains unclear. Based on the kindling model, this study examined the chain mediating effect of daily hassle and subjective vitality on the association between social media self-control failure and affective wellbeing (i.e., positive affect and negative affect). A sample of 490 Chinese social media users (Mage= 24.2,SDage= 8.3, 72.4% female) completed an online survey. Structural equation modeling results showed that: (1) Social media self-control failure was associated with lower positive affect and higher negative affect directly. (2) Their direct associations were serially mediated by daily hassle and subjective vitality. The results indicated that intermittent social media self-control failure might have durable effects on affective wellbeing through increasing perceptions of daily hassle and depleting one’s subjective vitality.
Current research categorizes corporate crises into product-functional and value-related. Given these differences, it is critical to understand how firms can tailor their response strategies, enhance crisis management and build better relationships with consumers. Using consumer negativity as a mediator, this paper provides insights into the effects of combining crisis type and coping strategies on consumers’ tendency to share negative feedback. The findings suggest that responsibility-oriented coping strategies are better at suppressing negative feedback in product functionality crises, while empathy-oriented approaches are more effective in value-related crises. The interaction between crisis types and negative feedback coping strategies was mediated by consumers’ negative emotions. This study adds depth to the corporate crisis communication literature and provides insights into effective crisis response strategies.
Caregiver sensitivity, especially female sensitivity, plays a crucial role in the cognitive and socioemotional development of children. However, existing measures of sensitivity have limitations. To enhance the study of caregiver sensitivity and advance research in this area, the current study aimed to develop and evaluate the reliability and validity of the Caregiver Sensitivity Scale (CSS) in Chinese. Through literature review and professional assessment, 34 items were formed to measure caregiver sensitivity. Two samples were recruited: the first sample included 749 participants (391 mothers and 358 grandmothers) for item analysis, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), internal consistency reliability analysis and validity analysis; the second sample comprised 421 participants (217 mothers and 204 grandmothers) for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and test-retest reliability analysis. The final 21-item scale comprised five sub-scales, according to Maslow’s Hierarchy Theory of Needs, named physiological need sensitivity, safety need sensitivity, concern need sensitivity, understanding need sensitivity, and support need sensitivity. Internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability for the five dimensions and the entire questionnaire were ranged from 0.76 to 0.93. The construct validity had reached psychometric standard. Concurrent validity was assessed by examining the correlations of the CSS with the Child Attachment Scale and the Child Adjustment and Parent Efficacy Scale, with significant associations delivered. Additionally, the measurement invariance analysis suggested that the CSS was equally applicable across mothers and grandmothers. Overall, the CSS is a validated and reliable measure of female caregiver sensitivity.
Although a large body of work has explored the mechanisms underlying metaphor comprehension, less research has focused on spontaneous metaphor production. Previous research suggests that reasoning about analogies can induce a relational mindset, which causes a greater focus on underlying abstract similarities. We explored how inducing a relational mindset may increase the tendency to use metaphors to describe topics. Participants first solved a series of either cross-domain (i.e., far) analogies (kitten:cat::spark-?) to induce a high relational mindset or within-domain (i.e., near) analogies (kitten:cat::puppy-?) (control condition). Next, they received a series of topic descriptions containing either one feature (some jobs are confining) or three features (some jobs are confining, repetitive, and unpleasant), and were asked to provide a summary phrase of the topic. Use of metaphoric language increased when topics contained more features, and was particularly frequent in the high relational mindset condition. This finding suggests that the relational mindset induction may have shifted attention toward abstract comparisons, thereby facilitating the creative use of language involving metaphors.
Frequently, we perceive emotional information through multiple channels (e.g., face, voice, posture). These cues interact, facilitating emotional perception when congruent (similar across channels) compared to incongruent (different). Most previous studies on this congruency effect used stimuli from different sets, compromising their quality. In this context, we created and validated a new static stimulus set (ECIFBSS) featuring 1952 facial and body expressions of basic emotions in congruent and incongruent situations. We photographed 40 actors expressing facial emotions and body postures (anger, disgust, happiness, neutral, fear, surprise, and sadness) in both congruent and incongruent situations. The validation was conducted in two parts. In the first part, 76 participants performed a recognition task on facial and bodily expressions separately. In the second part, 40 participants performed the same recognition task, along with an evaluation of four features: intensity, authenticity, arousal, and valence. All emotions (face and body) were well recognized. Consistent with the literature, facial emotions were recognized better than body postures. Happiness was the most recognized facial emotion, while fear was the least. Among body expressions, anger had the highest recognition, while disgust was the least accurately recognized. Finally, facial and bodily expressions were considered moderately authentic, and the evaluation of intensity, valence, and arousal aligned with the dimensional model. The ECIFBSS offers static stimuli for studying facial and body expressions of basic emotions, providing a new tool to explore integrating emotional information from various channels and their reciprocal influence.
Perception of emotion conveyed through language is influenced by embodied experiences obtained from social interactions, which may vary across different cultures. To explore cross-cultural differences in the perception of emotion between Chinese and English speakers, this study collected norms of valence and arousal from 322 native Mandarin speakers for 4923 Chinese words translated from Warriner et al., (Behavior Research Methods, 45, 1191–1207,2013). Additionally, sensory experience ratings for each word were collected. Analysis demonstrated that the reliability of this dataset is satisfactory, as indicated by comparisons with previous datasets. We examined the distributions of valence and arousal for the entire dataset, as well as for positive and negative emotion categories. Further analysis suggested that valence, arousal, and sensory experience correlated with various psycholinguistic variables, including the number of syllables, number of strokes, imageability, familiarity, concreteness, frequency, and age of acquisition. Cross-language comparison indicated that native speakers of Chinese and English differ in their perception of emotional valence and arousal, largely due to cross-cultural variations associated with ecological, sociopolitical, and religious factors. This dataset will be a valuable resource for research examining the impact of emotional and sensory information on Chinese lexical processing, as well as for bilingual research investigating the interplay between language and emotion across different cultural contexts.
The paper analyzes current discussions concerning the so called “replicability crisis” – a notion describing difficulties in attempts to confirm existing research findings by their additional scrutiny or by new empirical studies. We propose interpretation that this “crisis” may be seen as a manifestation of the increasing inconsistency between, on the one hand, the outdated views on a human being and social structures dominating in the academic mainstream across various disciplines, including psychology and sociology, and, on the other hand, the reality of the emerging new stage of societal evolution, neo-structuration, which brings to the forefront individual agency. Our analysis suggests the possibilities for the future inter-disciplinary paradigmatic shift, which implies putting in the center of research not the idea of a constant or predictably developing individual in the context of solid external structures operating in line with a presumably sustainable “progress”. Instead, under increasing neo-structuration, individual agency becomes, simultaneously, a manifestation of the essence of human nature (as cultural psychology argues) and the driving force for societal transformations, including solving most acute social problems, in the concrete historical period. It means a fundamentally new task for social sciences and humanities: to elaborate methodological solutions and theoretical frameworks to systematically comprehend the contextually conditioned human ability to create and transform – and not only to reproduce. Addressing more attention to agency manifestations in digital environment and, in particular, to those congruent to social activism or volunteering, seems especially fruitful for comprehending human activity in the neo-structurated world.
Over the past few decades, Swahili–English and Lithuanian–English word pair databases have been extensively utilized in research on learning and memory. However, these normative databases are specifically designed for generating study stimuli in learning and memory research involving native (or fluent) English speakers. Consequently, they are not suitable for investigations that encompass populations whose first language is not English, such as Chinese individuals. Notably, native Chinese speakers constitute a substantial proportion, approximately 18%, of the global population. The current study aims to establish a new database of translation equivalences, specifically tailored to facilitate research on learning, memory, and metacognition among the Chinese population. We present a comprehensive set of normative measures for 200 Swahili–Chinese paired associates, including recall accuracy, recall latency, error patterns, confidence ratings, perceived learning difficulty, judgments of learning, and perceived learning interestingness for the entire word pairs. Additionally, we include word-likeness ratings and word length for the Swahili words, and concreteness ratings, familiarity ratings, word frequency, and number of strokes for the Chinese words. This diverse array of measures, gathered across a substantial number of Swahili–Chinese word pairs, is poised to effectively support future research seeking to investigate the intricate processes of learning, memory and metacognition within the Chinese population.
BackgroundAmidst rapid developmental changes, refugee-background adolescents (RBAs) face unique challenges during resettlement, including adapting to new cultures, languages, and educational systems, while often dealing with pre-migration trauma. These youth need support to navigate educational and career pathways in their host countries. Using asset-based approaches, Teen Response (TR), a community-based program, aims to help newly resettled refugee youth reach their educational and career goals.ObjectiveThis study examines the strategies used by Teen Response (TR) to support RBAs in their educational and career pathways, as perceived by the participants.MethodThis research is part of a larger study exploring RBAs’ experiences in a community-based program. This paper focuses on the findings from focus group data collected from fifteen RBAs, offering in-depth insights into their experiences and perspectives within a community-based program.ResultsAnalysis reveals three pivotal themes that significantly shaped the participants’ experiences: the learning environment, language competency support, cultural knowledge and skills enhancement in career pathways, and the need for extended support. Additionally, RBAs requested extended time in the program and advocated for all schools in the district to have access to TR.ConclusionOur findings underscore the importance of community-based support programs responsive to the distinct needs of RBAs and highlight the value of strategies that incorporate youths’ voices and perspectives.
BackgroundEmpathy of medical students is crucial, yet it tends to decline as students enter later academic years. Empathy appeared to be affected by the learning environment (LE), which could be a potential contributor. We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the association between LE and empathy.MethodThe study comprised overall 10,901 medical students from 12 Chinese medical schools. Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) was utilized to assess empathy, while a 5-point question and the Johns Hopkins Learning Environment Scale were employed to evaluate LE. JSE scores were compared across LE levels using Pearson Chi-square, Welch’s ANOVA, and univariable linear regression. After adjusting for covariates, multivariable linear and logistic regression were used to assess the independent connection between LE and empathy. Confounders were controlled by stratified subgroup analysis.ResultsLE was significantly associated with medical students’ empathy, as shown by the Pearson Chi-square test (p< 0.001) and Welch’s ANOVA (p< 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, lower JSE scores were linked to common, bad, and terrible LE (OR = 2.226, 95% CI = [2.011, 2.465],p< 0.001; OR = 2.558, 95% CI = [1.745, 3.751],p< 0.001; OR = 1.889, 95% CI = [1.131, 3.153], p = 0.015), while excellent LE was associated with higher JSE scores (OR = 0.348, 95% CI = [0.312, 0.388],p< 0.001). Linear regression and stratified subgroup analysis confirmed logistic regression’s findings.ConclusionLE was a significant predictor for empathy. Better LE was associated with higher empathy and worse LE was related to lower empathy. This inspired us to improve LE to enhance medical students’ empathy.
Autistic adults experience greater rates of anxiety and depression compared to the general population. Compassion-focused therapy interventions, aimed at promoting self-compassion capabilities, have shown efficacy in improving mental health outcomes in autistic and non-autistic samples suffering from self-criticism that contribute to difficulties in emotion regulation. We explored the experiences of autistic adults during a brief one-week online self-compassion exercise to evaluate it’s feasibility and acceptability through self-report, experience sampling, and parasympathetic activity measured via HRV. Pre- to post-intervention comparisons showed significant improvement in trait self-compassion and fears of self-compassion, but this did not extend to acute measures of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) nor difficulties in emotion regulation. HRV measures displayed significant increases during self-compassionate practice, although there were no significant changes in physiological reactivity pre- to post-intervention. Experience sampling measures found that whether participants acted on opportunities to be self-compassionate was predictive of concurrent evaluations of affective system activation, whereby acting self-compassionately was associated with greater reported activation of the soothing affective system. Together, our findings support the use of multimodal approaches to investigating the accessibility and efficacy of compassion-focused approaches to resolving emotional difficulties experienced by autistic adults.
BackgroundDieting is a common practice around the world. People who wish to lose weight, improve their eating habits, or reach a desired level of health often diet. Rumination, a pattern of repetitive negative thoughts and emotions, is typically found when individuals diet. The current study aimed to identify physical and psychological differences between maladaptive and normative eating behaviors in a sample from Lebanon.MethodsA cross-sectional design was adopted for the current study. It occurred between June and July 2022. Four hundred participants aged 18 and above participated. The research team used a snowball sampling method to recruit volunteers from all governorates of Lebanon.ResultsBeta values were used to compare independent variables in order to infer those that have the strongest effect on the dependent ones. Higher Body Mass Index, and belonging to cluster 3 (restriction of food intake and rumination) and cluster 1 (maladaptive eating behavior and rumination) compared to cluster 2 (normative eating behavior and thought) were significantly related to more dieting. Higher physical activity index and belonging to cluster 3 (restriction of food intake and rumination) and cluster 1 (maladaptive eating behavior and rumination) compared to cluster 2 (normative eating behavior and thought) were significantly related to higher levels of orthorexia nervosa tendencies.ConclusionsThe current research demonstrated a relationship between Body Mass Index, physical activity, rumination, and maladaptive eating patterns including restriction of food intake, dieting, and orthorexia nervosa. These results can help with identifying physical and psychological factors associated with maladaptive eating patterns, as well as guide interventions within the Lebanese population.
The perception of objects is a challenging task that requires recognizing visual elements and integrating them into a whole. While human vision prioritizes attention to the overall configuration, data from other species suggests this bias towards global form perception is not universal. Studies with pigeons indicate preferential attention to local details when both local and global information may be diagnostic, but studies with other bird species are more limited. To examine whether this local bias is class-wide or potentially species-specific, we studied whether African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus) have a bias towards local elements or the global configuration when processing Navon-like hierarchical form displays. Two parrots were tested using a computerized touch-screen two-alternative choice task that presented displays that were local-relevant or global-relevant. The results of several successive acquisition phases suggest that these parrots have no local or global bias, indicating differing evolutionary or ecological drives for visual processing among avian species.
Hand movements frequently occur with speech. The extent to which the memories that guide co-speech hand movements are tied to the speech they occur with is unclear. Here, we paired the acquisition of a new hand movement with speech. Thirty participants adapted a ballistic hand movement of a joystick to a visuomotor rotation either in isolation or while producing a word in time with their movements. Within participants, the after-effect of adaptation (i.e., the motor memory) was examined with or without co-incident speech. After-effects were greater for hand movements produced in the context in which adaptation occurred – i.e., with or without speech. In a second experiment, 30 new participants adapted a hand movement while saying the words “tap” or “hit”. After-effects were greater when hand movements occurred with the specific word produced during adaptation. The results demonstrate that memories of co-speech hand movements are partially tied to the speech they are learned with. The findings have implications for theories of sensorimotor control and our understanding of the relationship between gestures, speech and meaning.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, families with children who had complex special needs faced many obstacles and had less resources available to them. Little published research has described post-lockdown family functioning in clinical samples. The current study investigated caregiver well-being, family functioning, and child/youth symptomatology in three Canadian samples of families with children/youth who had pre-existing, complex, emotional, behavioural, developmental, and mental health needs pre-pandemic (clinic intake within 1 year prior to March 2020), COVID pandemic (clinic intake 1 year during societal lockdowns), and post-restrictions (clinic intake between summer 2022 and summer 2023). Cross-sectional archival data (n> 300 in each cohort) were compared from assessments completed by families as standard of care at a tertiary children’s service agency. As predicted, the pandemic intake sample reported significantly more parental mental health challenges, stress, conflicts, and went on fewer recreational outings than the pre-pandemic sample. While parent stress levels and family outing rates in the post-restriction sample resembled the pre-pandemic sample, post-lockdown parental mental health symptoms, family conflict, and family respite levels indicate that families are still recovering. Child symptom levels were high in all three samples, likely a result of intake criteria at this tertiary mental health agency. Research recommendations are offered. Clinical agencies should be mindful that some families of children with complex needs may still be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic changes and consider using a family oriented, trauma-informed care approach to assess the effect of the pandemic.
This study sought to understand differences in the visual attention of voters with different party predispositions. We collected the political ads of the two major parties – the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) – for councilors in Taipei City and Kaohsiung City in the November 2022 local elections in Taiwan and recruited 82 participants (Taipei 40, Kaohsiung 42) for eye-tracking experiments 15 to 75 days before the election. The results showed that the eye movement behaviors of voters (total fixation duration (TFD), time to first fixation (TFF), and first fixation duration (FFD)) were affected by political ad elements: policy slogans, councilors, mayors, and party logos. Visual complexity (i.e., single and double- candidate ads) moderated the relationship between ad elements and voters' visual attention, and double-candidate ads (i.e., coattail effect) had a positive impact on voters' visual attention. We also found that voters' party predisposition leads to selective attention consistent with their attitudes. These results serve as a reference for political ad design.
Many cognitive models, including those for predicting the time of future events, can be mapped onto a particular form of neural representation in which activity across a population of neurons is restricted to manifolds that specify the Laplace transform of functions of continuous variables. These populations coding the Laplace transform are associated with another population that inverts the transform, approximating the original function. This paper presents a neural circuit that uses continuous attractor dynamics to represent the Laplace transform of a delta function evolving in time. One population places an edge at any location along a 1-D array of neurons; another population places a bump at a location corresponding to the edge. Together, these two populations can estimate a Laplace transform of delta functions in time along with an approximate inverse transform. Building the circuit so the edge moves at an appropriate speed enables the network to represent events as a function of log time. Choosing the connections appropriately within the edge network makes the network states map onto Laplace transform with exponential change as a function of time. In this paper, we model a learned temporal association in which one stimulus predicts another at some fixed delayT. Shortly aftert=0, the first stimulus recedes into the past. The Laplace Neural Manifold representing the past maintains the Laplace transform exp(-st). Another Laplace Neural Manifold represents the predicted future. Att=0, the second stimulus is represented a timeTin the future. At each moment between 0 andT, firing over the Laplace transform predicting the future changes as exp[-s(T-t)]. Despite exponential growth in firing, the circuit is robust to noise, making it a practical means to implement Laplace Neural Manifolds in populations of neurons for a variety of cognitive models.
BackgroundThere is a need for improved understanding of why 20–30% of individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) develop a severe and enduring form of illness (SE-AN). Previously, we reported differences in proactive inhibition (a pre-emptive slowing of responses) in individuals with AN compared to healthy controls (after controlling for intolerance of uncertainty). The present study is a preliminary exploration of proactive inhibition in which we compared women with SE-AN with healthy comparison (HC) women and explored its association with restrictive/avoidant eating behaviours.MethodsThirty-four women with SE-AN (defined by >3 years of illness and a previous unsuccessful course of eating disorder treatment) and 30 HCs completed (a) a cued reaction time task, to assess proactive inhibition, and (b) questionnaires assessing restrictive/avoidant eating behaviours and intolerance of uncertainty.ResultsBoth SE-AN and HC participants showed slower reaction times under conditions of uncertainty, indicating proactive inhibition in both groups. There was a main effect of group, with SE-AN participants showing significantly slower reaction times compared to HC. There was no interaction between group and condition, suggesting that individuals with SE-AN did not differ in proactive inhibition compared to HCs. However, post-hoc analysis between-group tests for each trial type revealed that group differences were only present under conditions of uncertainty. Proactive inhibition was not significantly associated with self-reported restrictive/avoidant eating behaviours, including when taking intolerance of uncertainty into consideration.ConclusionsIt is unlikely that proactive inhibition contributes to avoidant and restrictive eating behaviours seen in SE-AN. Our findings suggest that the SE-AN group are relatively more cautious when responding under conditions of uncertainty. Longitudinal studies and between-group comparisons of individuals across different stages of illness will be required to elucidate the way in which proactive inhibition is specifically implicated in SE-AN, rather than in AN more generally.
This interview article explores how British anthropologist Tim Ingold’s work can inspire innovation in mental health and the psy disciplines. Ingold critiques dominant biomedical and individualistic approaches, arguing for the importance of caring attentiveness and abolishing dichotomies like those between surface and depth, when engaging with people to understand and assist them. Instead, he suggests viewing human existence as correspondences with environmental, social, and relational others. The interview highlights the concept of “doing-undergoing,” proposing that care is a reciprocal, relational process. Ingold’s ideas suggest a shift towards practices that engage directly with the world and promote attentiveness to human and more-than-human relations. The article encourages practitioners, educators and students of mental health disciplines to rethink traditional models and adopt more humane approaches.
This paper explores the captivating narratives of women’s suffering as expressed in “Ask Me About My Uterus” by Abby Norman (2018) and “It’s Always Something” by Gilda Radner (1989). The exploration navigates the complex maze of healthcare, illuminating the difficulties women encounter in articulating and confirming their pain. Abby Norman’s insightful examination of her personal medical journey provides a modern viewpoint, untangling the intricacies of illnesses such as endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Gilda Radner’s enduring memoir provides a historical perspective, documenting her struggles with disease and the institutional disregard for health issues that specifically affect women. Both narratives function as potent catalysts, pushing for the acknowledgment of women’s suffering not only as a medical imperative, but also as a vital stride towards achieving gender parity in healthcare. This paper discusses the experiences, highlighting the significance of empathy, comprehension, and a transformative strategy to shift the discussion about women’s health.
ObjectivesMindfulness practice and trait self-compassion are promising coping resources to buffer against emotional stress reactivity and promote stress recovery. The potential variation in stress-buffering effects across gender is understudied. This study examined whether stress-buffering effects of a brief 20-min mindfulness practice and trait self-compassion vary by gender in a pilot randomized controlled trial.MethodUndergraduates (n= 55; 44% women, 56% men) were randomized to a brief mindfulness practice or control group activity and then immediately underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). We conducted repeated-measures ANCOVAs to examine whether there were effects of the mindfulness intervention with and without gender as a moderator (primary aim). We then examined whether trait self-compassion buffered against stress reactivity and aided in recovery while controlling for condition assignment, and if these effects varied by gender (secondary aim).ResultsGender significantly moderated the effect of the mindfulness practice. Men in the mindfulness condition reported reduced stress reactivity compared to men in the control condition, while there was no difference in stress reactivity across conditions for women. Gender also significantly moderated the effects of trait self-compassion such that women with higher self-compassion reported reduced stress reactivity and better recovery relative to women with lower self-compassion. Conversely and unexpectedly, men with higher self-compassion reported increased stress reactivity relative to men with lower self-compassion.ConclusionsDifferent coping resources (i.e., brief mindfulness practice and trait self-compassion) may be differentially effective across gender, indicating that future interventions may need to be tailored by gender.PreregistrationThis study was not preregistered.
Infertility has emerged as a significant and pressing issue in contemporary times. From a global standpoint, 1 in 6 adults experience fertility challenges worldwide. The current study aims to understand the psychological distress that Indian infertile couples experience, as well as the effects of psychological therapies on reducing this distress within the Indian population through Systematic Review. Indian Research studies from Frontiers, PubMed, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, Shodhganga, and other relevant journals were accessed and reviewed following the PRISMA guidelines. From the literature search, it was found that various psychological factors, such as depression, anxiety, and stress, were discovered to be commonly experienced during the journey of infertility and its treatment process. The utilization of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Couple Counselling, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy, Relaxation techniques, Psychoeducation, and integrated approaches of the psychotherapies have proven to be highly effective in treating psychological distress of Indian infertile patients and have also been shown to improve pregnancy outcomes. The findings of the study will be helpful in identifying the research gaps, current trends, and advanced psycho-therapeutic methods to deal with the psychological distress related to infertility.
The natural frequency facilitate effect in Bayesian reasoning is well-established, but the role of graphic representation remains debated. Probability is a core component of mathematics education, and enhancing probability literacy in junior high students is crucial. In specific contexts, these students can grasp Bayesian rules, with their graphic comprehension closely linked to spatial ability. This study involved junior high students using Bayesian tasks on breast cancer and lie problem, coupled with spatial ability questionnaires. Two experiments examined the impact of graphic representation on students’ cognitive mechanisms and reasoning strategies. The findings reveal that graphic representation significantly influences probabilistic reasoning, with better performance in familiar contexts. In unfamiliar contexts, graphics facilitate reasoning, particularly with unit square, where students outperform those using tree diagrams. High spatial ability students excel in interpreting unit square. Predominantly, their reasoning aligns with Bayesian and conservatism strategies, though it varies by context and spatial ability.
Time attitude refers to an individual’s feelings, thoughts, and evaluations regarding the past, present, and future; time attitude influences interpretations, goal-setting, choices and actions in both academic and social contexts. Given the impact of culture on the formation of time attitudes, it is crucial to explore how these components manifest in the specific cultural and social conditions of Iran. To this end, a qualitative methodology including interviews with focus group and grounded theory was used to investigate how youth conceptualize time and their attitudes toward it. The study included 44 participants (23 male and 21 female) in the third to sixth semester in the Tehran University. Six focus groups were formed, three for each gender, to discuss perceptions of time. Their responses regarding their perception of time were categorized in five categories including o’clock, passing, limitation, valuableness and feeling of fear. The results of open and axial coding for past, present and future revealed that Iranian youth perceive time in seven distinct categories: positive future, ambiguous future, hedonistic present, negative present, positive past, negative past and past acceptance. In conclusion, time attitude depends on culture and cultural-social conditions influence time attitude of youth.
The Malaysian public service confronts a pressing challenge in delivering impactful performance that serves the society and the nation. Addressing this challenge, this study aims to investigate the intricate relationship between organizational career management practices, career competencies, career success, and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Drawing upon the social cognitive and social exchange theories, a comprehensive research model is constructed. Data were gathered from 605 civil servants who play pivotal roles in shaping, executing, and overseeing public policies. Utilizing Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), the findings demonstrate a significant and positive influence of career management practices on OCB, with career competencies and career success acting as sequential mediators. Theoretically, this study emphasizes the necessity of balancing organizational and individual factors to enhance OCB performance. Practically, the study offers actionable insights for policymakers to formulate tailored strategies aimed at fostering organizational citizenship behavior, a pivotal element in achieving heightened performance among civil servants in Malaysia.
In a country where entrepreneurship is encouraged, Omani SMEs must make informed and strategic decisions to navigate the highly competitive business landscape. Decision-making in Omani SMEs is guided by several factors such as market conditions, financial resources, government policies, and cultural values. This research aims to investigate the emotions and psychological well-being of Omani entrepreneurs in decision-making through entrepreneurial intention. The target population of this research was the entrepreneurs in Omani SMEs where the sample consisted of 114 Omani entrepreneurs (founders, co-founders of SMEs) who were selected randomly from different industrial areas in Oman under the industrial areas (Madayn). This study utilizing Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) found that the health and emotional intelligence of Omani business owners significantly influence decision-making in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as entrepreneurial aspirations. These findings are crucial for comprehending the traits and actions of business owners when making decisions in SMEs. The study also explored practical and economic consequences offering suggestions to entrepreneurs such as seeking support and feedback, setting real objectives, fostering a positive attitude, self-care practices, and maintaining a work-life balance.
This study aims to investigate the influencing factors and mechanisms of college students’ AI tool usage behavior by integrating the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model with the rational behavior model. Using structural equation modeling, we analyzed data from 1,287 college students measuring self-media advertising influence, peer influence, self-efficacy, cognitive attitudes, educational regulations, and usage behavior. Results show that self-media advertising (β = 0.091,p< 0.01), peer influence (β = 0.151,p< 0.001), and self-efficacy (β = 0.669,p< 0.001) significantly influence students’ attitudes toward AI tools, with self-efficacy demonstrating the most substantial effect (f²= 1.492). Mediation analysis reveals that cognitive attitudes and educational regulations are significant mediating pathways, with the integrated model showing strong explanatory power (R²= 0.89). This study concludes that while external stimuli affect students’ adoption of AI tools through dual mediating pathways of attitudes and regulations, internal psychological factors play a more decisive role. The findings suggest that educational institutions should develop comprehensive AI literacy programs while establishing well-designed regulatory frameworks to guide appropriate AI tool usage.
Psychological characteristics are associated with varying dementia risk and protective factors. To determine whether these characteristics aggregate into psychological profiles and whether these profiles differentially relate to aging health, we conducted a cross-sectional investigation in two independent middle-aged (51.4 ± 7.0 years (mean ± s.d.);N= 750) and older adult (71.1 ± 5.9 years;N= 282) cohorts, supplemented by longitudinal analyses in the former. Using a person-centered approach, three profiles emerged in both cohorts: those with low protective characteristics (profile 1), high risk characteristics (profile 2) and well-balanced characteristics (profile 3). Profile 1 showed the worst objective cognition in older age and middle age (at follow-up), and most rapid cortical thinning. Profile 2 exhibited the worst mental health symptomology and lowest sleep quality in both older age and middle age. We identified profile-dependent divergent patterns of associations that may suggest two distinct paths for mental, cognitive and brain health, emphasizing the need for comprehensive psychological assessments in dementia prevention research to identify groups for more personalized behavior-change strategies.
Emotion is inevitably present in almost every action that learners and teachers take in the L2 classroom. More specifically, English as foreign language (EFL) learners experience various emotions—pleasant or unpleasant—the regulation of which can contribute to the effectiveness of their skill performance. Despite the surge of interest in emotion regulation (ER) in language education, research on how ER affects EFL learners’ oral performance, especially in emotionally-loaded speaking tasks, is surprisingly underrepresented. To address this void, the current mixed-methods study investigated EFL learners’ performance in emotionally-loaded speaking tasks after receiving a six-week ER training intervention. Prior to the intervention, a proficiency test was administered to the participants for the purpose of homogenization. Semi-formal interviews, along with demographic questionnaires, further ensured their previous non-participation in psychology-related courses. The final sample (N= 59) were assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. The results revealed that the experimental group, who received the ER intervention, performed significantly better on emotionally-loaded speaking tasks—in linguistic/discoursal accuracy, interactive communication, and emotional mastery. The findings from stimulated recall interviews with participants further confirmed the actual recruitment of ER strategies by participants who received the intervention and their effectiveness in emotionally-loaded speaking tasks.
Subjective support-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (SS-CBT) could increase subjective support among (pre)frail community-dwelling older adults, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We conducted a randomized controlled trial, in which the SS-CBT group (n= 50) received SS-CBT once a week for eight weeks and the wait-list control group (n= 50) received no intervention. The dependent variable was subjective support, and potential mediators included self-esteem, gratitude, cognitive distortions, interpersonal competence and rumination. Measurements took place before and after the intervention. We found that interpersonal competence mediated the effectiveness of SS-CBT on both perceived support availability (β= 2.030, 95%CI= 1.164, 3.081) and perceived support adequacy (β= 6.37, 95%CI= 3.52, 9.74), while self-esteem only mediated the effectiveness of SS-CBT on perceived support availability (β= 1.621, 95%CI= 0.502, 2.843). Gratitude, cognitive distortions, and rumination neither mediated the effectiveness of SS-CBT on perceived support availability nor on perceived support adequacy. These findings highlight self-esteem and interpersonal competence as the mechanisms through which SS-CBT increases subjective support, especially perceived support availability. This implicates that the SS-CBT should exclusively emphasize the apparent active ingredients (self-esteem and interpersonal competence) to promote its efficiency.
In the post-COVID-19 era, digital applications have become increasingly integral to leisure and recreational activities. This study explores how digital transformation influences individual decision-making about engaging in leisure activities across various regions of Taiwan. Data were gathered through questionnaires distributed across northern, central, and southern Taiwan, and other areas. The results reveal that digital attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and service innovation all significantly impact consumer behavior, with digital attitudes standing out as the most powerful driver of recreational engagement. This highlights the critical role of promoting positive digital attitudes through focused digital transformation efforts. Although competitive strategies were expected to strongly moderate the relationship between service innovation and consumer behavior, this effect was less substantial than anticipated, suggesting limited differentiation within digital services in the industry. As the digital landscape increasingly shapes leisure and recreational choices, this research offers valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of leisure activities in the postpandemic world.
Psychological entitlement is the belief that one deserves more. As an environmental factor that is systematically related to individuals’ beliefs about themselves and subsequent social behaviors, socioeconomic status is also closely related to psychological entitlement. However, previous research on this relationship remains insufficient. In the present three studies, we aimed to explore the relationship between socioeconomic status and psychological entitlement and its potential internal mechanisms. We recruited senior high school and college school students in Northwest China as participants. In the first study, we found that subjective socioeconomic status had a stronger explanatory power of psychological entitlement than objective socioeconomic status. In the following studies, we found that explicit self-focused attention (Study 2a) and implicit self-focused attention (Study 2b) mediated the positive relationship between socioeconomic status and psychological entitlement, respectively. Moreover, the results show that self-compassion only moderated the relationship between explicit self-focused attention (not implicit self-focused attention) and psychological entitlement. For lower self-compassion individuals, explicit self-focused attention was positively related to psychological entitlement. While for higher self-compassion individuals, there was no significant correlation between explicit self-focused attention and psychological entitlement. These findings expand the social cognitive theory of social class and have implications for understanding beliefs behind different socioeconomic statuses and taking corresponding measures.
The streamer is crucial for triggering purchase intention in live streaming while also encouraging consumers’ willingness to give virtual gifts. However, whether different streamer type has different effects on purchase intention or gift-giving intention is an open question. The aim of this study is to explore the effects of different streamer types (informer vs. entertainer) on purchase intention and gift-giving intention, the underlying mechanisms, and the moderating role of language style. Three experimental studies were conducted. Study 1 examined the effects of different streamer types on purchase intention and gift-giving intention. Study 2 examined the mediating roles of utilitarian value and hedonic value in the above effects. Study 3 investigated the moderating effects of language style, specifically sensory and rational language. The presence of sensory language was found to amplify the impact of entertainer on hedonic value, whereas rational language was more effective than sensory language in enhancing the influence of informer on utilitarian value. This study expands the research of different streamer types, and deepens the understanding of purchase intention and gift-giving intention. Moreover, this study reveals the understanding of the process mechanism of utilitarian value and hedonic value, and demonstrates the moderating role of language style. At the same time, the conclusion of this study has certain guiding will for the brand or retailer to select streamer type and language strategy.
Young women of color frequently face discrimination, reflecting the intersecting societal influences of sexism and racism. Although friendships play a significant role in women’s lives, there is a lack of research on the role of friendships in navigating exposure to gendered racial discrimination (in-person and social media) and associated mental health. This study investigated the extent to which the content of friendship conversations (i.e., co-rumination against gendered racism, socializing messages related to gendered racial pride and empowerment and oppression awareness) and perceived friendship intimacy and support mediated or moderated the positive association between exposure to gendered racism and mental health. Co-rumination was tested as a mediator, while the other variables were examined as moderators. Online survey data were collected from 339 cisgender women aged 18–24 (M age= 20.90,SD= 1.96; 32.74% Asian, 33.92% Black, and 33.33% Hispanic or Latina; 68.14% identified as straight or heterosexual). Participants described friendship communications and perceived intimacy and support with a same gender and race close friend. Exposure to gendered racial discrimination was significantly associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and substance use as a coping mechanism. Co-rumination about gendered racism was positively correlated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conversely, pride and empowerment socialization was negatively associated with substance use for coping, while oppression awareness socialization was positively correlated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Structural Equation Modeling Analyses indicated that co-rumination partially mediated the relationship between gendered racism exposure and anxiety symptoms, with other friendship indices not moderating these associations. These findings highlight co-rumination about gendered racism as a risk factor for young women of color and underscore the importance of exploring how the multifaceted nature of friendships is associated with exposure to gendered racism and mental health.
BackgroundIn China, research on the mental health of transgender populations is increasingly prevalent; however, there is a lack of localized psychological measurement tools that align with the characteristics of this population. The Transgender Congruence Scale (TCS) is widely used internationally. This study aims to assess the reliability, validity, and psychometric characteristics of the Chinese version of the TCS among the Chinese transgender sample.MethodsA total of 264 participants with a mean age of 24.88 (SD= 5.91) were recruited from October 2023 to January 2024. They completed the Chinese version of the TCS, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Confirmatory factor analysis of the TCS was performed using IBM SPSS Amos 28 software to assess the construct validity. Reliability, convergent validity, and measurement invariance analysis were also evaluated.ResultsThe reliability coefficients of the revised 9-item TCS were satisfactory (Cronbach’s α = 0.85, McDonald’s ω = 0.87). The two-factor model of the instrument was supported (χ2(26) = 52.525,p= 0.002, CFI = 0.979, TLI = 0.971, SRMR = 0.052, RMSEA = 0.062 [90% CI = 0.037, 0.086]). The TCS scores significantly correlated with life satisfaction (r= 0.486,p< 0.001), stress (r= -0.182,p< 0.01), depression (r= -0.176,p< 0.01), and anxiety (r= -0.176,p< 0.01). The measurement validity of the TCS is good across different gender identity groups.ConclusionsThese findings suggested that the TCS can serve as a short yet effective tool for assessing the congruence between external appearance and internal self among TGD individuals in clinical or research settings.
IntroductionSouth Africa’s Department of Basic Education introduced a policy in December 2021 to protect rural school learners from sexual exploitation. Schools must report statutory rape cases involving pregnant learners under 16 years of age with partners over 16. However, rural implementation faces significant barriers, highlighting the gap between policy intent and reality.MethodsA cyclical longitudinal ethnographic design was used to investigate the reasons for the limited implementation of the policy in rural schools. The data were collected through group discussions with 19 educators in August 2024 in the Soutpansberg North Circuit. The analysis, guided by an ethnographic content analysis framework, drew on intersectionality and social and cultural norms theories.ResultsThe findings revealed that in addition to a lack of awareness of the policy and a lack of training, deep-rooted sociocultural norms hindered teachers and schools from reporting statutory rape cases. The findings also suggested interventions to improve implementation.ConclusionBased on the study findings, we recommend adopting a multidisciplinary approach and integrating knowledge and methodologies from various fields, such as education, psychology, and social work. Specifically, we recommend that the Department of Basic Education should raise awareness of the policy in schools and among teachers and communities; implement a confidential, standardised reporting system; and provide training to educators on handling statutory rape cases to ensure more effective implementation and achieve the intended outcomes of the policy.Policy ImplicationsTo bridge the gap between the statutory rape policy and effective implementation, policymakers must contextualise educational policies in terms of the realities of rural South African teachers.
ObjectivePatients at risk of dementia, such as those with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), present with specific clinical symptoms, as well as functional and structural changes within the brain. Dispositional mindfulness (DM) has been linked to better cognition and is associated with activation and grey matter volume changes in specific brain regions in healthy adults. This study aimed to investigate how DM changes along the trajectory of cognitive decline in patients at risk for AD and to identify the brain structures that may be responsible for these changes in DM.MethodIn total, 79 older adults (SCD = 48, MCI = 31) underwent cognitive testing and brain MRI volumetry, resting-state functional MRI derived connectivity, and diffusion-weighted imaging. DM was assessed with the Breath Counting Task (BCT).ResultsParticipants with MCI showed worse mean counting accuracy in the BCT compared to those with SCD (adjustedp< 0.001). Higher functional connectivity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex predicted greater counting accuracy in MCI, but not in SCD. The difference between MCI and SCD in regression slope was also statistically significant for ventromedial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity (adjustedp= 0.002). No other statistically significant associations were found between DM, MRI indices, and neuropsychological variables in either group.ConclusionMCI and SCD were associated with distinctly different levels of DM, possibly due to more severe cognitive decline in MCI. Functional changes in ventromedial prefrontal cortex in MCI could play a key role in the worsening of DM in this population.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.
BackgroundMothers of children with ADHD struggle with everyday challenges that exceed from the signs and symptoms of ADHD. They have applied different coping mechanisms, comprising spiritual practice commitments. The study aims to explore spiritual practices as a coping mechanism for mothers of children with ADHD.MethodQualitative exploratory research methodology was conducted with 22 mothers who were selected via purposive sampling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and the data were analysed via thematic analysis.ResultsThe findings were discussed with three main themes and six subthemes:01) cognitive appraisal—thinking with faith and belief about higher power; 2) behavioral practices—individual practices and group approaches; and 3) support from religious leaders—common support with religious concepts and specific personnel support.ConclusionsThis study discussed the religious commitment as coping of mothers, who used them as coping mechanisms while caring for a child with ADHD. They found a variety of culturally bound religious practice methods that were reported to be perceived as effective for their mental well-being.
Online comments have become the most important basis for consumers to choose restaurants and products online, as well as a key information source for companies to conduct big data analysis and build consumer portraits. However, the vast majority of users of the catering Online To Offline (O2O) platform mainly search and browse the comments of others on products or services, and have a low willingness to actively post comments. To explore the motivation of users participating in online comments on the catering O2O platform, this paper takes young consumers in first-tier, second-tier, and third-tier cities as the main research object, and uses the structural equation model to empirically analyze the relationship between technology-driven factors and individual-driven factors and participation in online comments from two levels: platform-related motivations and individual-related motivations. The results show that the intention of the catering O2O platform users to comment is directly affected by platform-related motivation (perceived usefulness) and individual-related motivation (reputation, self-efficacy, comment costs). In addition, the study also found that perceived ease of use has a significant positive impact on perceived usefulness, comment costs, and self-efficacy, thus indirectly affecting the comment intention; perceived usefulness has a significant positive impact on reputation; and reputation has a significant positive impact on self-efficacy. Based on the above research conclusions, this paper proposes targeted suggestions aimed at providing a reference for promoting the construction of online comment systems on the catering O2O platform and the development of the catering industry.
The self-matching task (SMT) is widely used to investigate the cognitive mechanisms underlying the self-prioritization effect (SPE), wherein performance is enhanced for self-associated stimuli compared to other-associated ones. Although the SMT robustly elicits the SPE, there is a lack of data quantifying the reliability of this paradigm. This is problematic, given the prevalence of the reliability paradox in cognitive tasks: many well-established cognitive tasks demonstrate relatively low reliability when used to evaluate individual differences, despite exhibiting replicable effects at the group level. To fill this gap, this preregistered study investigated the reliability of SPE derived from the SMT using a multiverse approach, combining all possible indicators and baselines reported in the literature. We first examined the robustness of 24 SPE measures across 42 datasets (N= 2250) using a meta-analytical approach. We then calculated the split-half reliability (r) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2) for each SPE measure. Our findings revealed a robust group-level SPE across datasets. However, when evaluating individual differences, SPE indices derived from reaction time (RT) and efficiency exhibited relatively higher, compared to other SPE indices, but still unsatisfied split-half reliability (approximately 0.5). The reliability across multiple time points, as assessed by ICC2, RT, and efficiency, demonstrated moderate levels of test–retest reliability (close to 0.5). These findings revealed the presence of a reliability paradox in the context of SMT-based SPE assessment. We discussed the implications of how to enhance individual-level reliability using this paradigm for future study design.
This study, using ChatGPT as a case, based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 3 (UTAUT3) model, explores university students’ attitudes, Behavioral Intentions (BI), and influencing factors towards Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). It focuses on two crucial moderating variables: Habit (H) and Personal Innovativeness (PI). The goal is to uncover the mechanisms through which H and PI influence GenAI BI, providing a deeper understanding of GenAI Usage Behavior (UB). This study conducted a comprehensive survey of 510 college students, utilizing SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 24.0 for data analysis. Results reveal significant positive impacts of Performance Expectations (PE), Effort Expectations (EE), Social Influence (SI), and Hedonic Motivation (HM) on students’ BI to use ChatGPT, except for Price Value (PV). Additionally, BI significantly influences actual UB. Moderation analysis shows H negatively moderates the BI-UB relationship, indicating its inhibitory effect, while PI positively moderates this relationship, emphasizing the innovative role in promoting GenAI usage. These findings contribute to a theoretical understanding of GenAI UB and offer practical product design and promotion insights.
Atypical face processing is commonly reported in autism. Its neural correlates have been explored extensively across single neuroimaging modalities within key regions of the face processing network, such as the fusiform gyrus (FFG). Nonetheless, it is poorly understood how variation in brain anatomy and function jointly impacts face processing and social functioning. Here we leveraged a large multimodal sample to study the cross-modal signature of face processing within the FFG across four imaging modalities (structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, task-functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography) in 204 autistic and nonautistic individuals aged 7–30 years (case–control design). We combined two methodological innovations—normative modeling and linked independent component analysis—to integrate individual-level deviations across modalities and assessed how multimodal components differentiated groups and informed social functioning in autism. Groups differed significantly in a multimodal component driven by bilateral resting-state functional MRI, bilateral structure, right task-functional MRI and left electroencephalography loadings in face-selective and retinotopic FFG. Multimodal components outperformed unimodal ones in differentiating groups. In autistic individuals, multimodal components were associated with cognitive and clinical features linked to social, but not nonsocial, functioning. These findings underscore the importance of elucidating multimodal neural associations of social functioning in autism, offering potential for the identification of mechanistic and prognostic biomarkers.
Estimating how the human body moves in space and time—body kinematics—has important applications for industry, healthcare, and several research fields. Gold-standard methodologies capturing body kinematics are expensive and impractical for naturalistic recordings as they rely on infrared-reflective wearables and bulky instrumentation. To overcome these limitations, several algorithms have been developed to extract body kinematics from plain video recordings. This comes with a drop in accuracy, which however has not been clearly quantified. To fill this knowledge gap, we analysed a dataset comprising 46 human participants exhibiting spontaneous movements of varying amplitude. Body kinematics were estimated using OpenPose (video-based) and Vicon (infrared-based) motion capture systems simultaneously. OpenPose accuracy was assessed using Vicon estimates as ground truth. We report that OpenPose accuracy is overall moderate and varies substantially across participants and body parts. This is explained by variability in movement amplitude. OpenPose estimates are weak for low-amplitude movements. Conversely, large-amplitude movements (i.e., > ~ 10 cm) yield highly accurate estimates. The relationship between accuracy and movement amplitude is not linear (but mostly exponential or power) and relatively robust to camera–body distance. Together, these results dissect the limits of video-based motion capture and provide useful guidelines for future studies.
ObjectivesDespite socialisation difficulties making up a diagnostic criterion for autism, paradoxically, research on autistic socialisation has historically omitted the relational aspect of social interactions, focusing instead on the interactional “deficits” of autistic individuals. Emerging research has, however, shown that non-autistic (NA) individuals might also have difficulties with relating to autistic people, suggesting that autistic–NA socialisation challenges are bidirectional. This qualitative study explored the perceptions of autistic and NA adults regarding inter-neurotype socialisation from a bidirectional perspective.MethodsThe researcher conducted 6 semi-structured interviews, exploring the views of NA (n= 3) and autistic (n= 3) adults with prior experience of autistic–NA interactions. Participants were asked about factors influencing the quality of autistic–NA communication and whether they believed these to be bidirectional. The researcher later collected, transcribed and collated interview data into themes utilising reflexive thematic analysis. Finally, the views of autistic participants were compared with the perceptions of their NA counterparts.ResultsData analysis resulted in the development of five corresponding themes across the two data sets. These themes included the following: the success of autistic–NA social interactions being influenced by bidirectional factors, the importance of enhanced autistic–NA socialisation, and the quality of autistic–NA communication being influenced by contextual factors.ConclusionThe findings indicated that both groups of participants agreed that the success of autistic–NA social interactions was somewhat influenced by bidirectional factors. Additionally, autistic and NA participants discussed the significance of contextual factors on the quality of inter-neurotype socialisation.
Although there is ample evidence linking academic and behavioral domains, few studies have examined the long-term, varied impacts of academic performance trajectories on problem behavior outcomes, particularly in early and middle adolescence. This study examined the different three-year academic performance trajectories, their links with behavioral outcomes, and the demographic and educational predictors that distinguish these patterns. The sample consisted of 10,279 Chinese adolescents (46.43% girls; Mage = 12.97 years, SD = 0.89). Three trajectory groups emerged: Moderate Start with Steady Growth (45.93%), High Start with Accelerated Growth (36.89%), and Low Start with Minimal Growth (17.17%). Demographic and educational factors (i.e., age, parents’ education, family income, family size, school climate, rank, and sector) predicted group membership. The High Start with Accelerated Growth group exhibited fewer externalizing problems than the other groups. The results underscored the differences in academic performance trajectories and their associations with the predictors and outcomes of problem behaviors, which has implications for academic and behavioral development.
Directional judgments of an arrow became slower when the direction and location were incongruent in a spatial Stroop task (i.e., a standard congruency effect). In contrast, gaze judgments were slower when they were congruent (i.e., a reversed congruency effect). This study examined the reaction time (RT) distribution of interference effects in a spatial Stroop task to clarify the temporal characteristics of the standard congruency effect, which is known to be reversed for social targets, such as gaze direction. Participants responded to laterally presented targets (i.e., arrows, gaze, fish-only, and fish with mosaic) while ignoring their location. The standard congruency effect of arrows decreased as the overall RT increased, reflecting the temporal decay of automatically activated task-irrelevant codes (i.e., location). Critically, the reversed congruency effect of gaze increased as the overall RT increased. This result supports the dual-stage hypothesis and reflects the late-arriving selective inhibition of task-irrelevant codes. Similar results were replicated in Experiment2, in which we manipulated the complexity of the backgrounds of nonsocial targets and in the reanalysis of existing data. These findings imply that the interplay between task-irrelevant activation and subsequent inhibition is modulated by specific stimulus characteristics, influencing spatial response selection.
BackgroundSocial support is relevant to studying well-being, quality of life, and health during aging, particularly in people over 50. Therefore, brief instruments that allow its measurement within the clinical evaluation and research processes are necessary. The ENRICH Social Support Scale (ESSI) is a brief and easy-to-use instrument that measures the perception of social support; however, its psychometric properties in people over 50 in the Chilean context have yet to be tested.MethodThis study had a non-experimental, longitudinal panel design in which a sample of 303 people over 50 years of age (M= 55.14 years,SD= 5.19; 52% women) were administered a survey incorporating sociodemographic variables, the ESSI and the Newsom Social Negativity Scale. 277 participants completed the follow-up survey (M= 56.75 years,SD= 5.15; 54% women). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), structural equation modeling (SEM), invariance analysis, and internal consistency tests were performed to determine the psychometric properties.ResultsThe six items from the scale load in a single-factor model obtained an excellent fit to the data and reliability coefficients (α = 0.902; ω = 0.904). The SEM analysis evidenced an inverse correlation between the ESSI and Newsom's social negativity scale, demonstrating evidence of construct validity. Furthermore, in the sex invariance analyses, the scalar level was reached, implying that the items’ meanings are the same for men and women. Finally, the residual level was reached in the temporal invariance analyses, which means that the scale items are consistent in time.ConclusionsThe ESSI is a reliable and valid tool to be used in the Chilean context both in the clinical setting and in research on people over 50. The evidence obtained supports its usability to appropriately measure the perception of social support, which is relevant considering that it has been associated with reports of higher quality of life and lower mortality and morbidity during aging.
Empathy and prosocial behavior are widely viewed as important components of social glue, enabling us to form and maintain long-term social bonds and benefit others. Here, we aimed to explore the role of multimodal empathy (trait empathy and state empathy) in intuitive helping behavior by integrating the emergency of event. In two lab-based experiments (totalN= 213), we tested the association between cognitive mode and helping behavior, as well as the potential role of emergency and multimodal empathy. The results suggested that the association between cognitive mode and helping behavior was complex and multifaceted, and it tended to vary depending on the emergency and the combination of empathic dimensions. State empathic concern, but not state personal distress mediated the effect of trait empathy on helping behavior in non-emergency situations, and this effect was observed only in the intuition condition. Our findings shed light on the link between multimodal empathy, cognitive modes, and prosocial behavior, and extend our understanding of the social heuristics hypothesis.
PurposeFamily Peer Advocates (FPA) are used in healthcare broadly to facilitate engagement and address disparities in care. We previously reported on the benefit of FPAs in the care of autistic children on caregiver stress. Caregivers of autistic children report significant levels of caregiver stress, in particular when associated with co-occurring conditions, such as Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which is associated with significant burden and rarely addressed by traditional systems of care. The present study employed a randomized, wait-list controlled design over six months to further evaluate the utility FPAs on the care of autistic children on caregiver stress, family quality of life and treatment utilization in underserved LatinX and Black autistic individuals and their caregivers. Our central hypothesis is that FPAs will be particularly beneficial to autistic participants with co-occurring ADHD.MethodsParticipants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (FPA,n= 24) or the control group (treatment as usual,n= 24). Participants assigned to the intervention group completed 12 one-to-one contacts (four in-person, eight remote) with their assigned FPA over a six-month period. All FPAs were certified in New York State and trained to deliver the Parent Empowerment Program. Primary outcome measures were caregiver stress and family quality of life. Secondary outcomes included child behavioral outcomes (i.e., irritability and hyperactivity), home behavioral compliance and service utilization. Variables were measured at baseline, month three and month six.ResultsWe observed clinically significant improvements in the intervention group on caregiver strain, family quality of life, and disruptive behaviors for autistic participants with co-occurring ADHD, while family treatment satisfaction improved irrespective of co-occurring ADHD.ConclusionWe propose that the FPA model is especially beneficial for caregivers of autistic children with co-occurring ADHD and/or those with a higher incidence of externalizing behaviors.
This theoretical paper offers an in-depth examination of the intersection between Theory of Mind (ToM) and artificial intelligence (AI), drawing on developmental psychology and philosophical analysis. By investigating the key developmental stages at which children begin to understand that others have distinct mental states, the paper provides a framework for assessing the cognitive boundaries of AI systems. It critically interrogates the pervasive human inclination to anthropomorphize machines, particularly through the attribution of complex mental states like “knowing,” “thinking,” or “believing” to AI entities that lack subjective experience. The paper argues that AI, while capable of simulating cognitive processes, operates without the conscious awareness that defines human cognition, raising profound epistemological and ethical questions. It explores the broader implications of this projection for society, considering how our conceptualization of AI affects both technological development and social structures. Ultimately, this interdisciplinary inquiry calls for a more nuanced understanding of the distinctions between human and machine cognition, advocating for responsible approaches to AI as its capabilities evolve.
The objects that humans produce and own serve as a primary framework for defining their lives. The nature of these objects has changed over time, as has the interaction between humans and objects. Recently, the digital age has transformed the nature of things, and now, physical and non-physical (digital) possessions coexist. The current study, therefore, attempted to understand what physical and digital objects entail as categories of things and also the engagement of people with these objects. Data was collected from digital natives (18–27 years old) and digital immigrants (28–45 years old) as defined by Prensky (On the Horizon, 9(6), 1–6,2001), who were residing in Delhi/NCR, India. It was collected in two phases. Phase 1 involved a qualitative survey to explore ideas related to different objects from 35 digital immigrants and 30 digital natives. Phase 2 involved an in-depth exploration of the findings from the earlier phase through semi-structured interviews conducted with 3 digital immigrants and 3 digital natives. Haase’s adaptation of Colaizzi’s method of analysis (ANS Advances in Nursing Science,9(2), 64–80,1987) was employed for analysis. The results revealed two theme clusters – perception of physical objects (physical occupancy, exclusive ownership, relative permanence) and perception of digital objects (internet connectivity, contrasting states of omnipresence and transience, and tangible dependency). As with physical objects, more and more objects connect to the Internet and the Internet of Things has become a reality. This study offers timely insights into the evolving relationship between people and objects.

BackgroundGrounding on the Resource-Based View (RBV) and organization support theory (OST), this study examines the effect of talent management practice (TMP) on perceived organizational support (POS), organizational performance (OP), and employee performance (EP) within the Jordanian telecom sector, with a specific focus on the mediating effect of POS’s between TMP-EP and OP relationship.MethodsThis study uses a cross-sectional method to collect data from 397 personnel at three Jordanian telecom enterprises. The Smart-PLS application assisted with structural equation modeling, which was used to examine the data.ResultsThe findings show that TMP and POS have large and favorable effects on EP and OP, with TMP having a particularly strong influence on POS. The interplay of TMP and POS has a significant favorable influence on EP and OP, with POS acting as a mediator between TMP and both EP and OP. These results advance the comprehension of theories of RBV and organizational support by illuminating the relationship and relevance of TMP and POS in the setting of Jordanian telecommunications enterprises.ConclusionThe study provides HR managers with practical insights into improving EP and OP by optimizing TMP and POS strategies. Recognizing the constraints of the cross-sectional methodology and self-reported assessments, the study recommends further studies to investigate the causal and longitudinal effects of TMP and POS on EP and OP and the mediating mechanisms of these interactions.
IntroductionThe prevalence of substance use among young adults has been increasing in Turkiye. Probation as a form of execution continues to grow in popularity around the world, as it has the potential for more successful outcomes than closed institutional execution methods. However, in the face of changing societal and individual needs, the probation system must rapidly adapt to current public realities, especially with new approaches, including the use of purposeful physical movement for young adults who are obliged due to illegal substance use. These competencies are the ability to regulate emotions, manage social relationships, and make responsible decisions.ObjectiveIt aims to implement active games, including physical activities, that support the social and emotional competencies of individuals in probation sentence.MethodsThis study presents the results of a pilot program held in Turkiye under an Erasmus + Key Action 3 project entitled Active Games for Change (AG4C), which includes a range of innovative face-to-face active games that were specifically created and designed to support the development of identified social emotional competencies in a probation directorate that serves young adult offenders. The study was carried out with 50 young adult offenders. The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) model, which defines five social and emotional skills (self-awareness, self-management, responsible decision making, relationship skills, social awareness), was used to support observation and game design. The present study involved the codesign of a total of 18 active games to develop these five competencies.ResultsThere was a significant difference between the scores at baseline and the mental wellbeing total and self-awareness scores of the offender individuals after the ActiveGames4Change intervention who had been exposed to the ActiveGames4Change program. The results, based on a two-tailed test, support the conclusion that the intervention had a significant impact on performance scores (from 1 to 3), which were collected from the educators across the nine assessed time points.ConclusionThis research has demonstrated that active games can play a particular and deliberate role not only in physical activity but also in developing social-emotional competencies in young individuals in probation settings in the justice system.Trial registrationThis trial is retrospectively registered online at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT06737744.
BackgroundBicycle messengers in the online food delivery sector typically work on an on-demand basis, have digitally mediated relationships with their employer, and have very limited labor rights. In this study, we explore how bicycle messengers themselves experience their workday and how platform work influences their identity and wellbeing.MethodWe conducted qualitative interviews with ten bicycle messengers working for Foodora and Wolt in Bergen and Oslo, Norway. We used reflexive thematic analysis to analyze the interviews.ResultsWe discerned five themes related to the dynamics of autonomy versus algorithmic control, the reduction of workers’ identity to the courier role, lack of collegial bonding among bicycle messengers, physical demands and risks of the job, and the transitory nature of courier work.ConclusionThe working experience of bicycle messengers is marked by a paradoxical sense of autonomy and powerlessness in the face of algorithmic control, a perceived sense of devaluation by others and its reproduction among their own colleagues, and competitive and at times hostile intra- and inter-group dynamics. We explore the implications of such working experiences for bicycle messengers’ wellbeing and identity within this newly evolving form of labor.
Despite the increasing number of registered behavior technicians (RBTs) certified yearly, applied behavior-analytic organizations report difficulties in hiring and retaining RBTs in Florida. The current study evaluated RBTs’ work experiences related to the shortage of RBTs in Florida, particularly work concerns that lead to burnout and turnover. Eleven RBTs were interviewed regarding their working conditions and perspectives on the RBT working conditions. A thematic analysis yielded four main themes: (1) challenges establishing and maintaining competency; (2) difficult working conditions; (3) a transient or unheard-of career; and (4) dissatisfaction with pay and benefits. Results suggested that RBTs’ experiences vastly differed across organizations and that a combination of variables impact RBT burnout and turnover, which may contribute to burnout and turnover among RBTs in Florida. Implications for future research on RBT burnout and turnover and recommendations for organizations are discussed.
The present study explored the mediating role of work-life balance in the relationship of adversity quotient and general role stress of Haryana police personnel in India. It also evaluated the direct effect of adversity quotient on role stress of police personnel. To conduct this quantitative research, data from 261 Haryana state police employees were obtained using stratified random sampling. Structural equation modeling confirmed that work-life balance fully mediates the relationship among adversity quotient and general role stress among Haryana police personnel. Adversity quotient also significantly affected police officers’ work-life balance. Therefore, it is imperative for the police department to concentrate on enhancing the adversity quotient of its personnel in order to mitigate the general role stress they experience from every role they undertake. This research builds upon previous analytical investigations into the connection between adversity quotient and role stress by incorporating the mediating influence of work-life balance. Furthermore, this research investigates the influence of adversity quotient on role stress, an area that has been somewhat overlooked in the existing body of literature. The research provides fresh perspectives into adversity quotient, role stress and WLB ideas from India, a developing country in the context of police personnel. Based on the literature, four hypotheses were framed, out of which three were proved significant and one was rejected.
This study examines the relationships among Foreign Language Learning Enjoyment (FLLE), L2 grit, academic burnout, and motivated behavior in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners, using a mixed-methods approach. A total of 534 Chinese undergraduate EFL learners participated in the quantitative phase, which used a cross-sectional survey, followed by narrative inquiry with 15 participants in the qualitative phase. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that FLLE positively influenced motivated behavior while reducing academic burnout. L2 grit mediated the relationships between FLLE, burnout, and motivation, indicating that enjoyment promotes perseverance and resilience. Burnout was found to negatively impact motivation, underscoring the role of emotional well-being in maintaining engagement. The qualitative findings further supported these results, offering insights into learners’ experiences of joy, perseverance, and recovery from burnout. Participants described how moments of enjoyment reignited their long-term motivation, while grit helped them persevere through challenges. Burnout was linked to emotional exhaustion, but positive experiences often helped restore motivation. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the emotional and psychological factors influencing language learning success. The study provides important implications for educators, highlighting the need to create positive learning environments, promote resilience, and address burnout to support students’ sustained commitment to language learning.
The use of single-subject research designs is common among behavior analysts, as well as among other professionals interested in the study of behavior. Although there are clear guidelines for creating graphs to represent data collected with these designs, the type of tools used to produce them requires considerable time and effort to cover the specific criteria to plot data for each type of design and always involves the purchase of a software’s license. This manuscript describes four functions created in R language to automatically produce plots with specific characteristics for data collected using single-subject experimental designs. These functions were included in a package created in R to facilitate their sharing, installation, and use (R package for data analysis and representation in behavior science. The application of these functions is exemplified for the cases of reversal design, multi-element design, changing criteria, and multiple baseline. The relevance and convenience of functions is illustrated and discussed in the context of other proposals that have been made for the specialized production of plots for single-subject research designs.
Cerebral palsy (CP) is the leading cause of childhood physical impairment in the world. Problem behaviors, including self-injury, disruption, and responses associated with aggression, are commonly observed in children diagnosed with CP. This study describes the assessment and treatment of problem behaviors for three children with CP. The interventions were conducted in the classroom setting, with teachers and peers present. For participant one, the targeted behaviors were scratching and biting others, which were maintained by access to tangibles and escape from physical contact. A functional communication training (FCT) procedure was effective in establishing an alternative response that replaced scratching and biting. For the second participant, an FCT procedure was implemented to teach a communication response that successfully replaced spitting, which was maintained by peer and teacher attention. For the third participant, the targeted behavior was hand mouthing, which was maintained by automatic reinforcement. A response interruption and redirection (RIRD) procedure effectively reduced the problem behavior. These findings extend the generality of those of previous research, showing that FCT and RIRD are effective in reducing challenging behaviors in a special childhood setting, where teachers become the primary intervention agents.
The serial dependence effect (SDE) is a perceptual bias where current stimuli are perceived as more similar to recently seen stimuli, possibly enhancing the stability and continuity of visual perception. Although SDE has been observed across many visual features, it remains unclear whether humans rely on a single mechanism of SDE to support numerosity processing across two distinct numerical ranges: subitizing (i.e., small numerosity processing, likely related to early object recognition) and estimation (i.e., large numerosity processing, likely related to ensemble numerosity extraction). Here, we show that subitizing and estimation exhibit distinct SDE patterns. Subitizing is characterized by an asymmetric SDE, whereas estimation demonstrates a symmetric SDE. Specifically, in subitizing, the SDE occurs only when the current magnitude is smaller than the previous magnitude but not when it is larger. In contrast, the SDE in estimation is present in both scenarios. We propose that these differences arise from distinct underlying mechanisms. A perceptual mechanism—namely, a ‘temporal hysteresis’ account, can explain the asymmetrical SDE in subitizing since object individuation resources are easily activated but resistant to deactivation. Conversely, a combination of perceptual and post-perceptual mechanisms can account for the SDEs in estimation, as both perceptual and post-perceptual interference can reduce the SDEs. Critically, a novel type of SDE characterized by reduced processing precision is found in subitizing only, implying that thecontinuityandstabilityof numerical processing can be dissociable in dynamic situations where numerical information is integrated over time. Our findings reveal the multifaceted nature of SDE mechanisms and suggest their engagement with cognitive modules likely subserving different functionalities.
Self-directed digital health interventions offer a promising approach to treating post-trauma psychopathology. Despite their effectiveness, adherence and completion rates for these interventions are often low. One potential reason for this low adherence is the design of many digital interventions, which frequently lack "sticky" features that promote high engagement among individuals with post-trauma psychopathology. Identifying these features is crucial for improving the implementation of digital health treatments. This study aimed to identify the types of smartphone applications most frequently used by individuals with elevated post-trauma psychopathology to pinpoint such engaging features. A community sample (N = 332) of trauma-exposed adults reported their daily use of smartphone activities (i.e., playing games, using social media, texting, browsing the web, listening to music, watching videos) and completed measures of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. The findings revealed significant positive associations between higher levels of psychopathology and being female with spending more time engaging in smartphone activities. Individuals with higher levels of psychopathology spent more time on mobile games and social media compared to those with lower levels of psychopathology. These results highlight the importance of tailoring digital interventions to align with individuals' existing smartphone habits. Emphasizing social and gamified features in digital health interventions may potentially enhance adherence and engagement among those with post-trauma psychopathology.
The current study explored the topological properties of brain network using graph theory-based whole-brain network analysis during cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. EEG data of twenty-seven participants during emotion regulation task were collected, which were projected into the source space. Topological properties were calculated by graph theory analysis. Although the significant differences between emotion regulation strategies in global level were not found, the significant differences in nodal betweenness centrality (BC) were observed. The inferior parietal lobule (IPL), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) / medial frontal gyrus (MeFG) were involved during the cognitive reappraisal. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), STG and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) were involved during the expressive suppression. The differences between the two strategies were observed in the IPL, fusiform gyrus (FG) / inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). We conclude that the activities of temporal cortex, parietal cortex, and PHG might provide evidence for the differences between these two strategies.
The Q-matrix is one of the core components of cognitive diagnostic assessment, which is a matrix describing the relationship between items and the attributes being assessed. Numerous studies have shown that inaccuracies in defining the Q-matrix can degrade parameter estimation and model fitting results. Currently, Q-matrix validation often involves exhaustive search algorithms (ESA), which traverse through all possible\(q\)-vectors and determine the optimal\(q\)-vector for items based on indicators or criteria corresponding to different validation methods. However, ESA methods are time-consuming, especially when the number of attributes is large, as the search complexity grows exponentially. This study proposes a more efficient search algorithm, the priority attribute algorithm (PAA), which conducts searches one by one according to the priority of attributes, greatly simplifying the search process. Simulation studies indicate that PAA can significantly enhance search efficiency while maintaining the same or even higher accuracy than ESA, particularly when dealing with a large number of attributes. Moreover, the Q-matrix validation method employing PAA demonstrates better applicability to small samples. A real-data analysis indicates that applying the PAA-based Q-matrix validation method may yield suggested Q-matrices with higher model–data fit and greater practical utility.
With the interrelatedness between global health and mental health equity being evident, this article provides an overview of several related areas and contemporary issues that can be addressed through the globalization of counseling and international counseling. Additionally, with global service-learning in counselor education having several benefits that can lead to the advancement and globalization of counseling, essential elements that relate to implementation in specialty areas are discussed. Contemporary research also indicates the potential of service-learning in counselor education to contribute towards advancing health equity, mental health counseling equity, and international counseling. Therefore, recommendations, implications, and a case example are included for counselor educators, counselors-in-training, clinicians, and stakeholders interested in global service-learning course development and implementation.
Online language and literacy assessments have become prevalent in research and practice across settings. However, a notable exception is the assessment of handwriting and spelling, which has traditionally been conducted in person with paper and pencil. In light of this, we developed an automated, browser-based handwriting test application (Online Assessment of Handwriting and Spelling:OAHaS) for Japanese Kanji (Study1) and examined its psychometric properties (Study2). The automated scoring function using convolutional neural network (CNN) models achieved high recall (98.7%) and specificity (84.4%), as well as high agreement with manual scoring (95.4%). Additionally, behavioral validation with data from primary school children (N= 261, 49.0% female, age range = 6–12 years) indicated the high reliability and validity of our online test application, with a strong correlation between children’s scores on the online and paper-based tests (r= .86). Moreover, our analysis indicated the potential utility of writing fluency measures (latency and duration) that are automatically recorded by OAHaS. Taken together, our browser-based application demonstrated the feasibility and viability of remote and automated assessment of handwriting skills, providing a streamlined approach to research and practice on handwriting. The source code of the application and supporting materials are available on Open Science Framework.
The current study examined the extent to which gender/sex preference moderated the role of cohabitation on incest avoidance in an online sample of 1,623 adults with at least one opposite-sex sibling. Consistent with previous research, we found that longer cohabitation with a sibling was associated with decreased sexual interest in sexual contact between hypothetical siblings. We extended the literature by finding that gender/sex preferences contribute significantly to our understanding of incest avoidance. Among female participants, we found that higher attraction to males was correlated with greater disgust toward hypothetical sibling incest, diminished sexual interest in hypothetical sibling incest, and fewer reports of sexual contact with their siblings. Among male participants, gender/sex preferences significantly moderated the relationship between cohabitation and reported sibling sexual contact. Males with higher attraction to females who had shorter cohabitation reported more sibling sexual contact compared to those with longer cohabitation; in contrast, males with higher attraction to males reported similar levels of sexual contact with siblings regardless of cohabitation length. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering gender/sex preferences to better understand the mechanisms underlying sibling incest.
Measurement of object recognition (OR) ability could predict learning and success in real-world settings, and there is hope that it may reduce bias often observed in cognitive tests. Although the measurement of visual OR is not expected to be influenced by the language of participants or the language of instructions, these assumptions remain largely untested. Here, we address the challenges of measuring OR abilities across linguistically diverse populations. In Study 1, we find that English–Spanish bilinguals, when randomly assigned to the English or Spanish version of the novel object memory test (NOMT), exhibit a highly similar overall performance. Study 2 extends this by assessing psychometric equivalence using an approach grounded in item response theory (IRT). We examined whether groups fluent in English or Spanish differed in (a) latent OR ability as assessed by a three-parameter logistic IRT model, and (2) the mapping of observed item responses on the latent OR construct, as assessed by differential item functioning (DIF) analyses. Spanish speakers performed better than English speakers, a difference we suggest is due to motivational differences between groups of vastly different size on the Prolific platform. That we found no substantial DIF between the groups tested in English or Spanish on the NOMT indicates measurement invariance. The feasibility of increasing diversity by combining groups tested in different languages remains unexplored. Adopting this approach could enable visual scientists to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in their research, and potentially in the broader application of their work in society.
Cognitive maps are thought to arise, at least in part, from our intrinsic curiosity to explore unknown places. However, it remains untested how curiosity shapes aspects of spatial exploration in humans. Combining a virtual reality task with indices of exploration complexity, we found that pre-exploration curiosity states predicted how much individualsspatiallyexplored environments, whereas markers ofvisualexploration determined post-exploration feelings of interest. Moreover, individual differences in curiosity traits, particularly Stress Tolerance, modulated the relationship between curiosity and spatial exploration, suggesting the capacity to cope with uncertainty enhances the curiosity-exploration link. Furthermore, both curiosity and spatial exploration predicted how precisely participants could recall spatial-relational details of the environment, as measured by a sketch map task. These results provide new evidence for a link between curiosity and exploratory behaviour, and how curiosity might shape cognitive map formation.
Road safety is a critical concern worldwide, impacting individuals, communities, and societies. As mobility increases, so does the risk of accidents and injuries on roads, emphasizing the need for preventive measures. Road safety volunteers contribute significantly to promoting and maintaining road safety, making it important to understand their motivations and resilience sources. This study aimed to uncover what drives their commitment and the factors influencing their experiences as volunteers, informing them about strategies to support and enhance their efforts. Interviews with 28 road safety volunteers revealed three key themes: the driving forces behind their engagement, including intrinsic motivation, a sense of purpose, and social connection; challenges and coping strategies, such as the need for training, resilience, and peer support; and multifaceted benefits, including positive community impact and enhanced social connectivity. These findings highlight the potential benefits of promoting education on safe driving practices and encouraging citizen involvement in reducing traffic violations and road accidents.
This study explores the intersection of language, identity, and transgenerational change within the Gujjar and Bakerwal communities, a transhumant pastoral tribe in Jammu and Kashmir. The study examines how linguistic practices reflect and influence the socio-cultural cognition of three generational cohorts—elders (F1), middle-aged adults (F2), and youth (F3)—amidst systemic pressures of assimilation and modernization. The study identifies distinct linguistic patterns tied to migration, education, and folk culture using qualitative data from focus group discussions and ethnographic observations. The findings reveal that F1 prioritizes terms associated with nostalgia and collective belonging, F2 expresses ambivalence amidst socio-political transitions, and F3 demonstrates a forward-looking identity that seeks to integrate tradition with modernity. This dynamic interplay underscores language as a medium for cultural continuity and adaptation. The study contributes to sociolinguistics and cultural cognitive science by illustrating how language serves as both a repository of cultural memory and a tool for negotiating identity in the face of systemic change.
Most vision labs have had to replace the formerly dominant CRT screens with LCDs and several studies have investigated whether changing the display type leads to changes in perceptual phenomena, since fundamental properties of the stimulation, e.g., the transition time between frames, differ between these different display technologies. While many phenomena have proven robust, Kihara et al. (2010) reported different metacontrast masking functions on LCDs compared to CRTs. This difference poses a challenge for the integration of new LCD-based findings with the established knowledge from studies with CRTs and requires theoretical accounts that consider the effects of different display types. However, before further conclusions can be drawn, the basic findings should be secured. Therefore, we tried to reproduce the display type effect by comparing metacontrast masking on an LCD and a CRT in two experiments. Our approach differs from the previous study by increasing the power and reliability of the measurements and carefully matching the two display types. In addition to display type, we varied target-mask stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) and stimulus-background polarity. Regardless of display type and polarity, we found the typical type-B masking functions. Evidence for a SOA-dependent display type effect in the black-on-white polarity condition from Experiment1was not replicated in Experiment2. Overall, the results indicate that metacontrast masking effects on objective and subjective measurements, i.e., discriminatory sensitivity and phenomenological reports, do not vary significantly with display technologies. This lack of display effects is discussed in the context of current theories of metacontrast masking.
In this article, the authors aim to offer a perspective on self-compassion capable of becoming part of a unified psychology; however not “from scratch”, but based on what Neff (2003a,b) proposed. This is through the analysis and refinement of her theory in two stages. First, they check whether the supposed six factors exist in the constitution of self-compassion using the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) technique in a collected sample for this study (249 participants, 69.8% women ranging in age from 18 to 65, median = 22). In the second stage, they analyze and refine Neff’s theory based on the results of the EFA, and in light of an evolutionary perspective and Aristotle’s philosophy, following, respectively, the suggestions proposed by Zagaria et al. (2020); Osmo and Borri (2024a) that aim to unify psychological science.
BackgroundDealing with death and dying patients is one of the most challenging aspects of medical practice. The purpose of this study was to assess the attitude of medical interns toward death and dying patients as well as their level of death anxiety.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted on medical interns across three countries—Egypt, Jordan, and Palestine—using an online survey created with Google Forms. The survey included sociodemographic information, the Approach to Death and Dying Patients Attitude Scale (ADDPAS), and Templer's Death Anxiety Scale (DAS). The sample size was calculated using OpenEpi, aiming for minimum 466 from Egypt, 273 from Jordan, and 348 from Palestine. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 27. Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests were used to evaluate significant associations between demographic variables and the outcomes of the scales. Spearman’s correlation coefficients and simple linear regression analysis assessed the relationship between the scales. Ap-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsThis cross-sectional study analysis was done on 1156 participants. The median age was 24 years (interquartile range “IQR”: 24–25), with most living in urban areas (74.6%). Females comprised 53.6%. The median score on the DAS was 8.00 (IQR: 6–11). Hardness in communicating with the dying and their relatives and avoidance of death and dying patients subscales median scores were 2.22 (IQR: 1.89–2.44) and 2.54 (IQR: 2.18–2.81), respectively. Females had higher death anxiety and a less positive attitude toward communicating with dying patients and their relatives. Egypt scored lower on the ADDPAS subscales but higher than Palestine and Jordan on the DAS. DAS had a significant indirect relationship with hardness in communicating with the dying patients and their relatives (r= -.384;p< 0.001) and avoiding death and dying patients (r= -.123;p< 0.001). Simple linear regression showed that the DAS significantly predicts both subscales.ConclusionsMedical interns showed moderate death anxiety and a positive attitude toward communication and avoidance of death and dying patients. Those with a higher level of death anxiety demonstrated a greater tendency to avoid dealing with dying patients and had more difficulties with communication. End-of-life training is recommended.
BackgroundTraining gaps regarding the diagnosis and management of eating disorders in diverse populations, including racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minoritized groups, have not been thoroughly examined.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine resident physicians’ knowledge and attitudes regarding eating disorders in diverse populations, with a focus on areas for improved training and intervention.MethodsNinety-two resident physicians in internal medicine, emergency medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, psychiatry, and surgery at an academic center completed an online survey from 12/1/2020–3/1/2021, which comprised multiple choice and vignette-style open-ended questions to assess knowledge and attitudes toward the management and clinical presentations of eating disorders. Overall, the survey response rate was 25.7%. Descriptive statistics were reported. Vignette-style questions were analyzed using inductive coding and the frequency of responses was reported.ResultsA minority of resident physicians self-reported confidence in their knowledge of the medical complications (n= 42, 45%), risk factors (n= 38, 41%), and clinical presentations (n= 32, 35%) associated with eating disorders. Responses to vignette-style questions correctly identified relevant management methods (such as electrolyte monitoring and referral to specialty care), but demonstrated limited knowledge of the clinical presentation of eating disorders. Furthermore, most respondents reported a lack of knowledge regarding eating disorders in sexual and gender minoritized patients (n= 68, 73.9%) as well as racial and ethnic minoritized patients (n= 64, 69.6%).ConclusionsOur findings suggest concerning gaps in knowledge and confidence among resident physicians with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders, particularly in racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minoritized patients. Moreover, responses to vignette-like questions indicate significant homogeneity in respondents’ perceptions of the clinical presentation of eating disorders, reflecting cultural biases which associate eating disorders with underweight, young, female patients. The majority did not feel competent in treating eating disorders in diverse populations and expressed desire for additional training in this area. More research is needed to better understand and address these gaps in eating disorder training, with the goal of increasing equity in patient outcomes.
Word associations are among the most direct ways to measure word meaning in human minds, capturing various relationships, even those formed by non-linguistic experiences. Although large-scale word associations exist for Dutch, English, and Spanish, there is a lack of data for Mandarin Chinese, the most widely spoken language from a distinct language family. Here we present the Small World of Words–Zhongwen (Chinese) (SWOW-ZH), a word association dataset of Mandarin Chinese derived from a three-response word association task. This dataset covers responses for over 10,000 cue words from more than 40,000 participants. We constructed a semantic network based on this dataset and evaluated concurrent validity of association-based measures by predicting human processing latencies and comparing them with text-based measures and word embeddings. Our results show that word centrality significantly predicts lexical decision and word naming speed. Furthermore, SWOW-ZH notably outperforms text-based embeddings and transformer-based large language models in predicting human-rated word relationships across varying sample sizes. We also highlight the unique characteristics of Chinese word associations, particularly focusing on word formation. Combined, our findings underscore the critical importance of large-scale human experimental data and its unique contribution to understanding the complexity and richness of language.
To examine the effect of using Virtual Reality distraction on salivary cortisol levels in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) during routine dental treatments. A randomized cross-over study was designed and children with a known diagnosis of ASD, between 8 and 15 years of age, requiring routine, non-invasive dental treatments, were recruited. They were divided into 2 groups (group 1 and group 2) and scheduled for dental treatments using conventional behavior management and/or VR distraction techniques in their first and second dental visit, accordingly. Wong-Baker Faces pain rating scale, Venham’s picture test and Frankl’s behavior rating scale were administered at the end of each visit to assess subjective parameters of pain, anxiety, and behavior. Salivary cortisol levels were estimated in all children at 3 intervals (baseline, pre-treatment, and post-treatment). 19 children completed the study protocol (group 1 = 10, group 2 = 9) and statistically significant changes were observed in subjective ratings of pain (between groups) and dental anxiety and behavior (between dental visits), in favor of when VR distraction was used. Statistically significant differences were noted in the physiologic stress of the children between dental visits at pre-treatment (in group 2), post-treatment (in both groups), and between the 2 groups at post-treatment (in visit 2), all in favor of VR distraction being used. VR distraction may be recommended as an effective behaviour management technique for children with ASD. CTRI/2018/05/013982 “Retrospectively Registered”.
BackgroundBiopsychosocial factors have been associated with body satisfaction/dissatisfaction and related body image concerns in adolescence; however, few studies have investigated these relationships in middle childhood, an important developmental phase for body satisfaction. This study investigated relationships between a range of biological (body mass index), psychological (child anxiety/depression, self-esteem, and self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism) and sociocultural (mother’s body dissatisfaction and comments about child’s appearance, father’s body dissatisfaction and comments about child’s appearance, peer teasing and child’s media exposure) factors and body satisfaction cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a sample of 7- and 8-year-old children.MethodsIn this study, participants from the longitudinal Children’s Body Image Development Study (in which children had been followed-up annually from 3 years old) were assessed by interview at 7 years old (Time 1;n= 293: girls = 167, boys = 126) and 8 years old (Time 2;n= 222; girls = 126, boys = 96) and their parents completed a questionnaire at each time point.ResultsMultiple regression analyses revealed that child self-esteem, socially prescribed perfectionism, and mother body dissatisfaction in the total sample at 7-years, as well as child self-esteem and mother body dissatisfaction in the total sample at 8-years were significant unique cross-sectional correlates of child body satisfaction. While self-esteem outcomes were replicated at both time points for boys and girls, some differences in patterns were found for other variables in the subsamples of boys versus girls across time points. Prospectively in partial correlations (controlling for Time 1 child body satisfaction), mother’s body dissatisfaction predicted later child body satisfaction in boys and child self-esteem predicted later body satisfaction in girls. However, no longitudinal biopsychosocial predictors were identified as contributing unique variance in child body satisfaction from 7- to 8-years old after accounting for Time 1 (7-yearold) child body satisfaction.ConclusionsThese findings point to important psychosocial factors that are consistently related to body satisfaction in children and could be targets for intervention, but also suggest that a number of biopsychosocial variables develop concurrently with body satisfaction.
Curiosity, an innate and intrinsic motivation to explore, makes vital contributions to learning in individuals of various ages. Epistemic curiosity centers on the drive to close information gaps and can be classified into joyous exploration and interest (I) and deprivation sensitivity (D) types. Each subtype is associated with different academic achievements, personality traits, emotions, and aspects of creativity. Building on the concept of epistemic curiosity in adults, the I- and D-type Epistemic Curiosity in Young Children (I/D-YC) scale was developed. The purpose of the present study was to validate the Chinese I/D-YC scale for preschoolers. Both exploratory factor analyses of data from 111 parents (Sample 1) and confirmatory factor analyses of data from 389 parents (Sample 2) indicated that the Chinese I/D-YC replicated the two-factor structure of the original scale. The scales’ convergent validity was examined with data from 189 parents (Sample 3) and 129 teachers (Sample 4), as its reliability and test–retest reliability was respectively examined with data from 389 to 82 parents (from sample 2). The results established the Chinese I/D-YC scale as a valid and reliable measure of epistemic curious behaviors in young Chinese children. Moreover, the cultivation of epistemic curiosity should weaken inhibition and this might enhance well-being and creativity and learning.
In conflicts that baffle traditional explanations and seem irrational or dysfunctional, what motivates individuals or groups to invest so heavily in struggle? This paper introduces a novel theoretical model that shifts the focus from rational action to coordinated activity guided by value hierarchies. By exploring how high-intensity conflicts (HICs) arise when agents perceive existential threats to their most cherished values—the very core of their identity—we gain insights into the fervor and sacrifices these conflicts entail. The model reveals that the intensity of a conflict is not dictated by the objective importance of the disputed issue but by the subjective significance assigned to it within an agent’s value hierarchy. Through this lens, the paper explains why some disputes escalate dramatically while others remain manageable, highlighting the role of asymmetric value systems in fueling conflict. It delves into the interplay between material and symbolic threats, demonstrating how even minor provocations can trigger profound reactions when they impinge upon foundational values. By examining illustrative cases, the model showcases its applicability across contexts. Ultimately, this framework offers scholars and practitioners a powerful tool for understanding and addressing conflicts that defy conventional logic. It paves the way for predicting conflict intensity and reconstructing agents’ value hierarchies based on observed behaviors, opening new avenues for effective conflict management and deeper comprehension of human motivations in strife.
This study investigates the performance of mediation analyses, including manipulation check variables, in experimental studies where manipulated psychological attributes are independent variables. We simulated the level of manipulation intensities and measurement errors of the manipulation check variable to test the validity of the analytic practice. Our results showed that when manipulation is successful and measurement error is low, mediation analyses with the manipulation check variable revealed an unstable path coefficient and standard error. Moreover, many of the detected indirect effects were inconsistent mediation situations. However, when individual differences in psychological attributes remained within the condition (low manipulation intensity) and the manipulation check variable contained low measurement error, the indirect effect indicated the validity of the manipulation. We discuss the implications of our findings for the use of manipulation checks in experimental research.
Father involvement is considered multidetermined, being influenced by personal and family characteristics. These variables, however, are rarely examined together, leaving unclear what makes fathers involved. A multilevel dyadic approach was used to examine the relationship between fathers’ and mothers’ demographics, parenting stress, coparenting, and father involvement among dual-earner couples (n= 311 dyads). Fathers (Mage= 39.33;SD= 6.04) and mothers (Mage= 36.81;SD= 5.96) of a young child (M= 4.36;SD= 1.69; 52.4% boys) reported on education, parental stress, and time committed to childcare (level 1 variables), work–family conflict, their child’s age, and coparenting (level 2). The findings revealed that, regarding individual variables (level 1), only father’s education and father’s time committed to child activities were related to a greater proportion of father involvement. At the family level (level 2), older children, more children in the family, and cooperative coparenting were related to a greater proportion of father involvement. The results highlight the importance of fathers’ perspectives and characteristics to their involvement. The findings may be used to promote father involvement and inform public policies on the topic.
PurposeThis study aims to explore the complex relationship between paternal and maternal parental psychological flexibility, parenting styles, and child problem behavior within the cultural context of China.MethodsStructural equation modeling was used to conduct statistical analysis on longitudinal data from 893 parent-child pairs in Shanghai.ResultsThe study found a significant negative correlation between maternal parental psychological flexibility and child problem behavior, with maternal authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles mediating this relationship. Conversely, paternal parental psychological flexibility exhibited no significant direct impact on child problem behavior, possibly influenced by traditional gender roles and the primary caregiver effect.ConclusionsThis research extends the Reactance-Inhibition Model and the Spillover Hypothesis Theory, elucidating the complex dynamics of family interactions. Practical implications underscore the importance of interventions such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and professional parenting training to enhance parental flexibility and implement effective parenting styles. Overall, this study contributes to understanding family dynamics and informs strategies for promoting healthy child development within different cultural contexts.
Brand names typically maintain a distinctive letter case (e.g.,IKEA,Google). This element is essential for theoretical (word recognition models) and practical (brand design) reasons. In abstractionist models, letter case is considered irrelevant, whereas instance-based models use surface information like letter case during lexical retrieval. Previous brand identification tasks reported faster responses to brands in their characteristic letter case (e.g.,IKEAandGooglefaster thanikeaandGOOGLE), favoring instance-based models. We examined whether this pattern can be generalized to normal sentence reading: Participants read sentences in which well-known brand names were presented intact (e.g.,IKEA,Google) or with a modified letter case (e.g.,Ikea,GOOGLE). Results showed a cost for brands written in uppercase, independently of their characteristic letter case, in early eye fixation measures (probability of first-fixation, first-fixation duration). However, for later measures (gaze duration and total times), fixation times were longer when the brand’s letter case was modified, restricted to those brands typically written in lowercase (e.g.,GOOGLE>Google, whereasIkea≲IKEA). Thus, during sentence reading, both the actual letter case and the typical letter case of brand names interact dynamically, posing problems for abstractionist models of reading.
Although green consumption behavior is essentially pro-social behavior, some studies indicate a higher tendency for green consumption in individuals of a higher social status, while individuals of lower social status exhibit a lower inclination. Therefore, this study aims to validate the green consumption tendencies of individuals from different social strata and explore the moderating role of identity symbolization. Confirming previous findings, we found that individuals of a higher social status are more willing to purchase green products than those of lower social status. Additionally, the choice of green products by individuals of lower social status is moderated by product symbolization. This study's findings unveil the underlying mechanisms of green product selection among individuals of lower social status and provide insights for green product marketing.
When comparing scores on psychological distress scales across people who use substances versus those who do not, it is essential that the psychometric characteristics of the measure across both groups are comparable. The current study investigated the presence of differential item functioning (DIF) in the Kessler 10 psychological distress scale (K10) among people who do and do not regularly use alcohol and other drugs. Data were from the 2019 National Drug Strategy Household Survey, a stratified, multistage random sample of Australian private households. Those aged between 18 and 79 with complete data were included in the analysis (n= 19339). A multiple indicator multiple cause (MIMIC) modelling approach was used to determine uniform and non-uniform DIF. The analysis identified indicators of tiredness, restlessness, psychomotor agitation, depression, and sadness that demonstrated significant levels of either uniform or non-uniform DIF across substance use groups. The overall impact of the identified DIF across groups was minimal. While there was minimal impact of DIF on overall K10 scores, the presence of DIF might reflect differences in the fundamental experience of psychological distress among those who use substances regularly. These differences could prove to be important when implementing universal prevention or early interventions for psychological distress.
In recent years, there has been growing interest in remote speech assessment through automated speech acoustic analysis. While the reliability of widely used features has been validated in professional recording settings, it remains unclear how the heterogeneity of consumer-grade recording devices, commonly used in nonclinical settings, impacts the reliability of these measurements. To address this issue, we systematically investigated the cross-device and test–retest reliability of classical speech acoustic measurements in a sample of healthy Chinese adults using consumer-grade equipment across three popular speech tasks: sustained phonation (SP), diadochokinesis (DDK), and picture description (PicD). A total of 51 participants completed two recording sessions spaced at least 24 hours apart. Speech outputs were recorded simultaneously using four devices: a voice recorder, laptop, tablet, and smartphone. Our results demonstrated good reliability for fundamental frequency and cepstral peak prominence in the SP task across testing sessions and devices. Other features from the SP and PicD tasks exhibited acceptable test–retest reliability, except for the period perturbation quotient from the tablet and formant frequency from the smartphone. However, measures from the DDK task showed a significant decrease in reliability on consumer-grade recording devices compared to professional devices. These findings indicate that the lower recording quality of consumer-grade equipment may compromise the reproducibility of syllable rate estimation, which is critical for DDK analysis. This study underscores the need for standardization of remote speech monitoring methodologies to ensure that remote home assessment provides accurate and reliable results for early screening.
This qualitative case study used artifacts (e.g., youth activities), archival records (mentor logs), and individual interviews to understand 12 Black youths’ experiences of an electronic mentoring (e-mentoring) program that was designed in partnership with a local Black church to address subclinical mental and behavioral health challenges that impacted K-12 students’ academic functioning. Findings revealed participants learned how to persevere and regulate their actions to counter maladaptive thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that impacted their engagement in school when faced with academic difficulties. Participants also learned how to maintain self-confidence and view themselves in a positive light through self-affirmations and by recognizing their strengths. Finally, the youth felt valued and nurtured by their mentors, which helped facilitate the students’ engagement in the program. This study shows how youth-centered e-mentoring through community partnerships with predominantly Black churches can help Black youth access culturally responsive mental health and behavioral health support that may foster their academic success.
There’s debate concerning whether perfectionism could be conceptualized as a form of psychopathology (internalizing or externalizing processes) or a psychological construct. These studies examined scores on the Short Almost Perfect Scale-8 (SAPS-8, Rice et al., 2014 Journal of Personality Assessment) and addressed this concern in perfectionism literature. The SAPS-8 is used to measure perfectionism as a psychological construct with two dimensions:StandardsandDiscrepancy. Study 1 (N= 358 undergraduates) examined empirical evidence for the factor structure (dimensions) and internal consistency reliability of the short form SAPS-8. Moreover, internal consistency reliability estimates were examined for the SAPS-8 and the original 23-item Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R) scale scores. In Study 2 (N= 267 undergraduates), the transdiagnostic model was adopted to examine the differential correlates of the SAPS-8 dimensions. We used established self-report measures of perfectionism (i.e., the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale), psychopathology (i.e., the Symptom Assessment-45), and measures of uncertainty, fear of negative evaluation, and suicide-related behaviors as concurrent measures. Reliability estimates were excellent (α> 0.80) for each scale score. The correlations between the SAPS-8 dimensions and the concurrent scale scores were low to high (rs ~ − 0.00 to 0.75). The results showed that the Discrepancy dimension is positive and moderate to strongly correlated with the scores on the measure of psychopathology (rs ~ 0.30 to 0.53). The findings further suggested that not all personality disorder scale scores [FMPS] were significantly associated with Standards and Discrepancy. Importantly, the results of the differential correlates can be valuable for understanding targeted interventions for the correlates of the specific dimensions.
In academia,scholarly impactis a prototypical performance criterion used for a variety of purposes, most noticeably, but not exclusively, promotion and tenure decisions. In making these decisions, one may ask, “What constitutes ‘good’ scholarly impact for an industrial-organizational psychologist?” Acknowledging some critiques raised against them, bibliometric indicators of scholarly impact have nevertheless become widely accepted. However, the availability of normative data would potentially further enhance their utility. So, using data based on all 2021 paid-up members of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology who listed academia as their primary work sector, restricted to only those in research-focused academic positions (N= 1075), the study’s objectives were to (1) present normative scholarly impact data for industrial-organizational psychologists in academia, (2) examine the relationships between various scholarly impact metrics in a test of their construct validity, (3) investigate how normative impact varies as a function of various factors, and (4) as a further test of their construct validity, explore the convergence between individual-level rankings based on textbook citations and impact metrics. In doing so, this study contributes to the broader discussion of “how we might define, generate, make sense of, measure, reward, and shape” (Haley et al.,2022, p. 347) scholarly impact. Finally, we provide an interactive dashboard that presents normative data which can be searched and sorted based on a variety of user-specified variables. The approach outlined and data presented here serve as a template for researchers seeking to generate similar normative data for other fields.
The escalating indirect exposure to terrorism through media has contributed to rising mental health issues among adolescents. The terrorist attack on Army Public School Peshawar (APSP) in Pakistan has received immense media coverage and the violence shown has touched the lives of natives. The current study adopts an Interpretative phenomenological analysis to explore the impact of indirect exposure to terrorism through media—television and Facebook—on adolescents' mental health in relation to terrorist attack on APSP. Moreover, the effect of changes occurred in parents’ behaviour and school settings after the stated terrorist attack were also considered. To gather data, six Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted with adolescents (N= 45) who were enrolled in educational institutes far from the epicentre of the attack and came to know about the attack through media. Acquired qualitative data was subjected to thematic analysis revealing that indirect exposure to terrorism through media negatively impact the mental health of adolescents. Likewise, the abrupt changes in school settings and parental behaviour cause disruption in their immediate environment that further impacts their well-being.
Purpose: Autistic adults experience high rates of traumatic events and PTSD. However, little work has evaluated motor vehicle accident (MVA) related trauma symptoms. The goal of this brief report was to provide pilot data characterizing MVA-related peritraumatic reactions, trauma symptoms, and rates of PTSD diagnosis and mental health service use among Autistic compared to non-autistic adults. Method: Participants were 637 adults in the United States (276 Autistic, 361 non-autistic) who completed an online survey assessing MVA experiences. Participants provided information about peritraumatic reactions to the accident, and whether they were diagnosed with PTSD or sought mental health services relating to the MVA. Participants also completed the Posttraumatic Symptom Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) in relation to the worst MVA experienced. Results: 48.7% of Autistic adults had experienced an MVA relative to 64.5% of non-autistic adults. Of those who experienced an MVA, Autistic adults reported higher peritraumatic dissociative reactions, and higher MVA-related total, negative mood/cognition, and hypervigilance PTSD symptoms than non-autistic adults, when adjusting for covariates. Autistic adults were significantly more likely to have sought mental health treatment relating to the MVA (11.9% compared to 0.9% of non-autistic adults), and to have received a PTSD diagnosis relating to the MVA (5.9% compared to 0.4% of non-autistic adults). Conclusion: Autistic adults reported higher levels of trauma-related sequalae in response to MVAs than non-autistic adults. Future research should examine MVA-related trauma in more diverse samples, and develop assessment and support strategies to better identify, prevent, and reduce trauma-related symptoms post MVAs for Autistic people.
School maladjustment results in greater emotional and academic distress and reduces subjective well-being among adolescents. It is therefore important to identify the variables that contribute to school adjustment problems in order to enable interventions designed to improve or mitigate them during this developmental period. The aim of the present study is to use structural equation modeling to examine the potential impact of social support, self-concept and resilience on school adjustment problems. Participants were 1397 adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years (M= 13.88 and SD = 1.27). The results reveal that peer support has a direct negative relationship on school integration problems, and that support from families and teachers has an indirect contribution through self-concept and resilience. The percentage of variance in school integration problems explained by the variables included in the study was 36.4%. The results have serious theoretical–practical implications that broaden the range of possibilities for preventing problems of this kind.
BackgroundAcademic procrastination is an increasingly pertinent issue among university students, impacting their academic performance, interpersonal relationships, and emotional well-being. However, brief assessment tools for timely intervention are scarce, especially in the Colombian context. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the academic procrastination scale and analyze its relationship with mental health and life satisfaction.MethodsA total of 805 Colombian university students were selected through convenience sampling. Their ages ranged from 17 to 35 years, with an average age of 20.4 years (SD = 3.0).ResultsThe findings reveal a modified two-factor structure of the scale, with adequate fit indices (χ2 = 65.65, df = 13,p< .001; CFI = .96, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .07 (90% CI .06 − .09), SRMR = .03) and loadings above .50. Furthermore, both factors of the scale exhibited high reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega coefficients greater than .80. The scale was also found to be gender invariant. Lastly, academic procrastination correlates positively with mental health and negatively with life satisfaction, while mental health relates negatively to life satisfaction.ConclusionThe Modified Academic Procrastination Scale (EPA-C) demonstrates adequate psychometric properties and is gender-invariant for assessing academic procrastination among Colombian university students. Moreover, it has an impact on the mental health and life satisfaction of these students.
PurposeThis study aims to examine how college students’ information literacy affects their online learning engagement and what factors contribute to this relationship.MethodThe research adopted the method of cluster sampling to deliver a questionnaire survey to a sample of 1421 students’ representative of four colleges. Information Literacy Scale, Online Learning Engagement Scale, Information Literacy Self-Efficacy Scale, and Psychological Resilience Scale were utilized in this study. SPSS 26.0 and the PROCESS plugin were used for correlation analysis, mediation effect and moderating effect testing. This study was based on the theories of learning engagement and self-determination and centred on building a moderated mediating model with online learning college students as its primary focus.Result(1) Among college students, there was a positive association between information literacy and online learning engagement; (2) Information literacy self-efficacy was demonstrated to mediate the relationship between information literacy and online learning engagement; (3) The impact of information literacy self-efficacy on online learning engagement and the influence of information literacy on online learning engagement were both moderated by psychological resilience.ConclusionColleges have the potential to enhance the online learning engagement of college students by improving their information literacy abilities, hence increasing their involvement in online learning projects. Implementing strategies including increasing the availability of online courses and improving teacher support in online learning can improve college students’ information literacy self-efficacy and psychological resilience. This, in turn, can increase their participation in online learning activities.
Despite being largely spoken and studied by language and cognitive scientists, Italian lacks large resources of language processing data. TheItalian Crowdsourcing Project(ICP) is a dataset of word recognition times and accuracy including responses to 130,465 words, which makes it the largest dataset of its kind item-wise. The data were collected in an online word knowledge task in which over 156,000 native speakers of Italian took part. We validated the ICP dataset by (1) showing that ICP reaction times correlate strongly (r= .78) with lexical decision latencies collected in a traditional lab experiment, (2) showing that the effect of major psycholinguistic variables (e.g., frequency, length, etc.) can be replicated in this dataset, and (3) replicating the effect of word prevalence, which we compute here for the first time for Italian. Given the inclusion of many inflectional forms of verbs, adjectives, and nouns, we further showcase the potential of this dataset by exploring two phenomena (inflectional entropy in verb paradigms and the clitic effect in isolated word recognition) that build on the peculiar properties of Italian. In this paper we present the ICP resource and release response times, accuracy, and prevalence estimates for all the words included.
Parent-led cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficient, promising form of therapy that may be well suited for autistic youth with anxiety disorders. A recent clinical trial found that parent-led CBT – in which parents led their child through a guided CBT workbook with varying degrees of therapist support – was efficacious for reducing anxiety and associated functional impairment. While such findings demonstrate promise for future intervention development and dissemination efforts with this population, more work is needed to elucidate clinical factors that impact response to treatment as well as drop-out. Using data from the aforementioned clinical trial (N= 87), the present exploratory study examined pre-treatment patient characteristics, including family accommodation (FA), anxiety severity, autism features, and externalizing psychopathology, and their relationship with relevant treatment outcomes (i.e., anxiety severity and functional impairment) at both post-treatment and three-month follow-up and drop-out/completer status. Our findings did not reveal any consistent relations between pre-treatment patient characteristics and clinical outcomes, with several isolated exceptions: (a) baseline autism features were associated with greater post-treatment functional impairment; (b) non-male (vs. male) gender was associated with greater functional impairment at 3-month follow-up; and (c) Hispanic ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic) was associated with greater likelihood of premature treatment drop-out. Findings are discussed in the context of the importance of continuing to elucidate unique patient characteristics predictive of optimal clinical outcomes for autistic youth with anxiety disorders.
PurposeThis study explored the narrative coherence of the accounts of an experienced event produced by autistic and neurotypical children (ages 6–15 years) after delays of two weeks and two months.MethodsThe sample comprised 27 autistic children and 32 neurotypical peers, who were interviewed about the event using the Revised National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Investigative Interview Protocol. The study focused on assessing the narrative coherence of children’s reports, emphasizing key story grammar elements and temporal features in their narratives.ResultsResults revealed that, over time, both autistic and neurotypical children showed a decrease in narrative coherence. Autistic children, particularly those who were cognitively and verbally able, demonstrated the ability to convey their experiences coherently, with performances comparable to those of their neurotypical peers. Interviewer prompts differentially influenced the narrative coherence of autistic and non-autistic children’s accounts.ConclusionThis research showed that, when questioned appropriately, cognitively and verbally able autistic children can effectively communicate their personal experiences, even after significant delays.
Few studies have comprehensively examined the reciprocal relation between specific parenting practices and children’s academic performance across parent and child gender. The present study investigated the bidirectional associations between parental warmth/control and children’s academic performance using a three-wave longitudinal multi-informant design. A total of 814 families (Mchild age= 10.36 years; SD = 1.22, 57% girls) participated in the study. Results of the random-intercept cross-lagged models indicated that paternal warmth promoted children’s academic performance at the between-family level, whereas maternal warmth promoted children’s academic performance at the within-family level. Interestingly, paternal control predicted better academic performance in boys over time (i.e., the within-family level) but contributed to girls’ worse academic performance than others (i.e., the between-family level). These results highlighted the gender-universal effects of parental warmth and the gender-specific effects of parental control on child academic performance in the Chinese context. These findings underscored the necessity of considering parent-child dynamics across different parent-child gender dyads.
Youth’s social status (popularity and likability) relates with social status goals as well as bullying and prosocial behaviors within the context of classroom norms for bullying and prosocial behaviors, but less clear is how each of these factors interrelates with each other. The current study empirically analyses the concurrent relationships among social status goals, bullying and prosocial behaviors, and classroom norms with social status. Participants were a nationally representative sample of 6,421 Slovenian early adolescents (50% females;Mage= 13 years;SD= 6 months). Findings indicated that popularity goals were related to bullying behaviors and bullying behaviors were related to popularity. In contrast, likability goals are related to prosocial behaviors, and prosocial behaviors are related to popularity and likability. The role of classroom norm salience was complex as bullying increased popularity in low-bullying environments, whereas prosocial behaviors enhanced likability in high prosocial classroom contexts. Students high on both bullying and prosocial behaviors (bistrategic controllers) demonstrated higher popularity and likability compared to their peers., but had similar relationships among their social status goals, bullying, prosocial behaviors, and social status as all other peers. The findings demonstrate a clear relationship among social status goals, bullying and prosocial behaviors, and social status (popularity and likability), while suggesting that classroom norms may differentiate how bullying/prosocial behaviors might align with social status.
Work-family conflict and work stress among metro drivers, where monotonous and irregular shift conditions are dominant, are one of the important concepts that can have an impact on job engagement. The study aims to analyze the effects of daily work stress, daily work to family conflict and emotional stability on daily job engagement. It adopts a multilevel approach where days are nested in people. Day-level survey data was collected from 40 metro drivers for ten consecutive days in Turkey. Results supported the necessity of using a multilevel approach. According to results, daily work stress and daily work to family conflict negatively and emotional stability positively affect job engagement.
In academia,scholarly impactis a prototypical performance criterion used for a variety of purposes, most noticeably, but not exclusively, promotion and tenure decisions. In making these decisions, one may ask, “What constitutes ‘good’ scholarly impact for an industrial-organizational psychologist?” Acknowledging some critiques raised against them, bibliometric indicators of scholarly impact have nevertheless become widely accepted. However, the availability of normative data would potentially further enhance their utility. So, using data based on all 2021 paid-up members of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology who listed academia as their primary work sector, restricted to only those in research-focused academic positions (N= 1075), the study’s objectives were to (1) present normative scholarly impact data for industrial-organizational psychologists in academia, (2) examine the relationships between various scholarly impact metrics in a test of their construct validity, (3) investigate how normative impact varies as a function of various factors, and (4) as a further test of their construct validity, explore the convergence between individual-level rankings based on textbook citations and impact metrics. In doing so, this study contributes to the broader discussion of “how we might define, generate, make sense of, measure, reward, and shape” (Haley et al.,2022, p. 347) scholarly impact. Finally, we provide an interactive dashboard that presents normative data which can be searched and sorted based on a variety of user-specified variables. The approach outlined and data presented here serve as a template for researchers seeking to generate similar normative data for other fields.
Perfectionists often experience elevated stress levels due to their tendencies toward compulsions, rigidity, and the relentless pursuit of unrealistically high standards. Humor has proven to be an effective coping mechanism for stress; however, the type of humor employed plays a crucial role. Hence, it is valuable to explore whether perfectionists effectively utilize humor strategies to manage stress. Additionally, it is important to determine which humor styles are most beneficial for them. Through four studies, we aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of humor strategies for stress relief among perfectionists. Studies 1 and 2 utilized the Chinese version of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (CFMPS), the 32-item Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ), and the Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI) in cross-sectional analyses. In Studies 3 and 4, we employed the stressful movie paradigm and a stressful life event recall paradigm to induce stress in a laboratory setting, manipulating perfectionism and humor separately. The findings indicated a positive association between perfectionism and both self-enhancing and self-defeating humor, with adaptive perfectionism being more closely linked to self-enhancing humor and maladaptive perfectionism to self-defeating humor. Both the cross-sectional and laboratory studies demonstrated that self-enhancing humor was more effective in relieving stress for perfectionists than self-defeating humor.
This study investigated the effectiveness of an eight-week mindfulness-based intervention program on the trait mindfulness, psychological well-being and emotion regulation of college-going students. The experimental group participants were college-going students (N= 40) who enrolled for the intervention, and the participants in the control group (N= 40) were interested in the intervention and considered as a wait-list control group. The experimental group underwent mindfulness-based interventions, which included 11–12 sessions, including brief exercises and meditations related to their trait mindfulness, emotion regulation, and psychological well-being. They received 2–3 h of training per week for eight weeks. Repeated Measures of ANOVA together with an independent sample t-test were used to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention programme. Further, Cohen’s d was used to calculate the effect size to explain the variance caused by the intervention program in trait mindfulness, emotion regulation, and psychological well-being. The results indicated that students significantly improved in their trait mindfulness, emotion regulation, and psychological well-being after receiving mindfulness training. In conclusion, the application of this eight-week mindfulness-based intervention sheds light on the common psychological issues confronted by college students in India, presenting itself as an advantageous tool for the professionals working in this field and offering positive effects on the overall well-being of college students.
The identity status model (Marcia et al., J Pers Soc Psychol 3:551--558, 1966)
 is a widely used framework for identity research in adolescence and adulthood. This paper explores the conceptual and empirical relations between two identity status assessments – the identity status interview (Marcia et al., in Ego identity, Springer, New York, 1993) and the Dimensions of Identity Development Scale (DIDS; Luyckx et al. in J Res Person, 42:58–82, 2008) ). Study 1 was a systematic review of studies that have statistically derived identity statuses based on the DIDS (k= 42 samples), revealing pronounced inconsistencies in the meaning and interpretations in the classifications. Study 2 examined the factor structure of the DIDS across three Swedish samples (N= 429), and then in a subsample of 123 young adults examined correspondence between the DIDS and the identity status interview. Although there were the expected correlations between commitment and exploration processes using the two methods, when the DIDS processes were plotted over the identity statuses as assessed in the identity status interview, expected relations were only detected for the moratorium status, and not for identity achievement, foreclosure, or diffusion. Together, our findings show that aside from the intentional changes made from Marcia’s identity status model to the dual-cycle model, there have been what appear to be a less intentional drift in the definition and operationalization of the core constructs shared by the two models. The findings highlight the need to keep the complexity in identity research, as the risk of getting lost in translation in measurement development is apparent.
The absence of explicit word boundaries is a distinctive characteristic of Chinese script, setting it apart from most alphabetic scripts, leading to word boundary disagreement among readers. Previous studies have examined how this feature may influence reading performance. However, further investigations are required to generate more ecologically valid and generalizable findings. In order to advance our understanding of the impact of word boundaries in Chinese reading, we introduce the Chinese Word Segmentation Agreement (CWSA) corpus. This corpus consists of 500 sentences, comprising 9813 character tokens and 1590 character types, and provides data on word segmentation agreement at each character position. The data revealed a high level of overall segmentation agreement (92%). However, participants disagreed on the position of word boundaries in 8.96% of the cases. Moreover, about 85% of the sentences contained at least one ambiguous word boundary. The character strings with high levels of disagreement were tentatively classified into three categories, namely the morphosyntactic type (e.g., “反映–了”), modifier–head type (e.g., “科學–教育”), and others (e.g., “大力–支持”). Finally, the agreement scores also significantly influenced reading behaviors, as evidenced by analyses with published eye movement data. Specifically, a high level of disagreement was associated with longer single fixation durations. We discuss the implications of these results and highlight how the CWSA corpus can facilitate future research on word segmentation in Chinese reading.
The vibration perception threshold (VPT) is the minimum amplitude required for conscious vibration perception. VPT assessments are essential in medical diagnostics, safety, and human–machine interaction technologies. However, factors like age, health conditions, and external variables affect VPTs. Various methodologies and distinct procedures have been used to access VPTs, leading to challenges in establishing standardized protocols. Following the PRISMA methodology, this systematic review was conducted to answer the research question: “How are vibration perception thresholds assessed on the glabrous skin of the hands and fingers of healthy humans?” Searches were conducted across five databases to locate recent studies reporting data from VPT assessments, published in English, between 2012 and 2023. Thirty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Data on study goals and various methodological aspects was categorized and analyzed. Information gaps were identified, and this review offers recommendations for future studies to enhance standardization and facilitate data comparison. This review also suggests directions for future research, aiming to improve our understanding of how humans perceive haptic information.
Among young adults, engaging in sexting (i.e., sharing sexually explicit materials of oneself with others) can be a healthy and normative sexual experience. However, there is risk associated with some types of sexting. The present study examined the rates and characteristics of high-risk sexting in a community sample of emerging adults (i.e., aged 18–30 years;N= 3,022). High-risk sexting was defined as participating in at least three of the following behaviors: showing one’s face in a sext, sexting someone met online, sexting before the age of 16, sexting while intoxicated, or posting one’s sext to a website. Over a quarter of participants had ever sent a high-risk sext (28%). Cisgender LGBPA+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, and other non-straight sexual orientations; 38%, 462/1,220) and transgender (34%; 106/309) participants were significantly more likely to have sent a high-risk sext than heterosexual cisgender participants (18%; 271/1,493). When examining the strength of the relationship between impulsivity, susceptibility to peer pressure, perceptions of sexting, and sexual history with high-risk sexting, we found that the effect sizes overlapped across all three groups, meaning that the relationship between each of the correlates and high-risk sexting was not significantly different across the three groups. We suggest that peer pressure, perceptions of sexting, and impulsivity could be promising targets to inform effective sexual education content, regardless of sexual orientation or gender.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been reported to exhibit altered local functional consistency. However, previous studies mainly focused on male samples and explored the temporal consistency in the ASD brain ignoring the spatial consistency. In this study, FOur-dimensional Consistency of local neural Activities (FOCA) analysis was used to investigate the sex differences of local spatiotemporal consistency of spontaneous brain activity in ASD. This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange database, including 64 males/64 females with ASD and 64 male/64 female neurotypical controls (NCs). Two-way analysis of variance was performed to ascertain diagnosis-by-sex interaction effects on whole brain FOCA maps. Moreover, granger causal analysis was used to investigate effective connectivity between the brain regions with interaction effects and the whole-brain in ASD. Significant diagnosis-by-sex interaction effects on FOCA were observed in the bilateral precuneus (PCUN), bilateral medial prefrontal cortex and right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus. Specifically, FOCA was significantly increased in males with ASD but decreased in females with ASD in the PCUN compared with the sex-matched NC group. In addition, the lack of sex differences in the causal influences from the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex to the PCUN was observed in ASD. Our results reveal altered sex differences in the spatiotemporal consistency of spontaneous brain activity and functional interaction of the anterior and posterior default mode network (DMN) in ASD, highlighting the critical role of the DMN in the sex heterogeneity of ASD.
Exploring the nuanced and often elusive realm of pre-reflective consciousness presents a methodological challenge, as it involves capturing experiences that arise prior to reflective thought and language. This article introducesPhenomenological Mapping, an innovative research method designed to systematically study the pre-reflective dimensions of human experience. Grounded in the foundational theories of Edmund Husserl (2012), Maurice Merleau-Ponty (2013), and Martin Heidegger (1992,2008), the approach also integrates contemporary perspectives from Dan Zahavi (1999,Contemporary Phenomenology and Qualitative Research5(1), 1–17,2021), Shaun Gallagher (2006,2017), and Evan Thompson (2010,2017). Drawing upon advancements in neurophenomenology, embodied cognition, and intersubjectivity, Phenomenological Mapping provides a structured framework for accessing and analyzing pre-reflective consciousness. This methodology guides researchers through a sequence of eleven phases, from initial preparation and contextualization to data collection, analysis, and integration. It employs Husserl’s phenomenological reduction, Merleau-Ponty’s concept of embodied perception, and Heidegger’s exploration of being-in-the-world. The approach is further enriched by Zahavi’s intersubjectivity, Gallagher’s work on embodiment, and Thompson’s continuum of consciousness. By utilizing multisensory data collection techniques—such as visual diaries, audio recordings, and experiential practices—Phenomenological Mapping offers a multi-dimensional approach to analyzing subjective experience. This research contributes a novel methodological tool to phenomenology, facilitating an empirical investigation that remains faithful to the philosophical foundations of pre-reflective consciousness while bridging empirical and theoretical domains.
Over the last decade, empirical evidence of the positive effect of job crafting on employee job satisfaction has grown. Following previous literature that recommends reorienting this line of research and considering the role of additional or intermediate variables to help explain its effects, the current study aimed to analyze how work meaning would explain the relationship between job crafting and satisfaction with life. Participants were 785 employees (50.2% women) with an average age of 41.41 years old. The Job Crafting Questionnaire (JCQ), the Work and Meaning Inventory (WAMI) and the Satisfaction with Life (SWL) were used as validated instruments for measuring variables of the study. After controlling for age, gender, weekly work hours, and length of service in the same company, a significant positive association of Job Crafting with Satisfaction with Life was found. Furthermore, mediation analysis using PROCESS revealed that Work Meaning mediated this relationship. The results of this study highlight the role of Job Crafting and Work Meaning, and in general the care for well-being at work, in the overall life satisfaction of working people.
The thematic analysis method was used to examine the social adaptation of hearing-impaired middle school students, in order to provide empirical evidence for efficiently improving their social adaptation ability. The results indicate that the current situation of social adaptation among hearing-impaired middle school students is that overall career adaptation ability is relatively low, interpersonal adaptation ability needs improvement, and self-regulation ability needs to be enhanced. The main influencing factors are learning methods, learning initiative, expectation level, communication skills, and the support of important others. The new findings of this study are as followings: the middle school students with hearing impairments have diverse ways of emotional regulation and have good emotional regulation effects; the junior middle school students with hearing impairment have their own unique understanding of ‘friends’, and may have already regarded ‘character’ as the foundation and core of ‘friends’.
This preliminary report is a single case study aiming to evaluate the feasibility of Video Intervention Therapy (VIT) in difficult scenarios involving high-risk mother-infant dyads in a housing program for homeless families. The study conducted in Clermont-Ferrand, France, used the Coding Interactive Behavior (CIB) system. Ruth Feldman's framework and Stuart et al.'s 4-EFA model was applied. Three VIT sessions showcased personalized interventions, aided by the CIB's role in observing and detailing changes. The results showed in this case that maternal insensitivity, characterized by high scores in intrusiveness, interference and directiveness, goes parallel to infant’s affective disconnection and social withdrawal. The VIT and CIB mutually reinforce the team's analysis and intervention perspectives pointing towards the feasibility of the video-intervention. The findings are discussed in relation to the design of future research and the need to include video intervention (VIT) work within the service's team of direct care professionals.
This study investigates the profiles of students involved in different forms of victimization using a person-centered approach. It examines the associated psychosocial characteristics, including bullying perpetration, peer support, self-perceived personality, loneliness, social self-concept, and negative affect. A sample of 2081 students (59% girls;Mage= 15.49,SD= 1.51) was analyzed. Latent profile analysis (LPA) identified three distinct profiles based on experiences of verbal, relational, and cyber victimization: nonvictims (89.8%), moderate victims (5.3%), and severe victims (4.9%). The analysis revealed significant differences among the profiles, with severe victims exhibiting the poorest psychosocial outcomes, characterized by high levels of loneliness, negative affect, and poor social self-concept. Moderate victims showed similarities to nonvictims in most characteristics, yet their role in bullying perpetration suggests they might be bully-victims. Nonvictims demonstrated the most favorable psychosocial profile. These findings indicate that victimization experiences are heterogeneous, with severe victims being the most negatively impacted. The study highlights the importance of differentiating between levels of victimization in research and practice to better address the needs of affected students. Future research should further explore the nuanced roles of moderate victims and the implications for intervention strategies.
Previous studies have discussed various kinds of behavioral imitation and the consequences thereof. The present research focuses on imitation of goal setting (hereafter referred to as “goal imitation”) and the effect this has on mimicked consumers’ goal-directed consumption. More importantly, the study distinguishes between the effects of mimickers who belong to different groups. Whereas most studies suggest that being associated with a dissociative out-group leads to negative responses from consumers, the present work explores the motivating effect of dissociative out-groups on participants’ goal pursuit. Five core studies have found that goal imitation by dissociative out-groups contributes to goal-directed consumption, which is driven by feeling challenged and goal persistence. The present study identifies goal type as the boundary condition of this mediation process. For consumers with attainment goals, goal imitation by dissociative out-groups (vs. the membership group) will lead to more (less) goal-directed consumption. For consumers with maintenance goals, however, this effect will disappear. The present study discusses theoretical and practical implications based on these findings.
The present paper treats the issue of methodological assumptions in mainstream neuropsychology and, as counter-concepts, in Vygotsky’s approach and Holzkamp’s critical psychology. The analysis identifies four main assumptions concerning the methodology of mainstream neuropsychology, which are contrasted with the positions of other approaches. The methodologies of the mainstream neuropsychology vs. Holzkamp’s and Vygotsky’s approach assume: (1) mechanistic vs. dialectical materialism; (2) formal vs. dialectical logic; (3) decomposition into elements vs. units; (4) reductionism of psychic processes to the brain vs. activity as a unity of environmental and organism-pole. Despite the vast coincidence in their main assumptions, we also discuss nuances of difference between Holzkamp’s and Vygotsky’s approaches. The former, possibly due to its reference to cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) and its theoretical neglection of the organism-pole of psychic functions, falls short of structural considerations in its accounts on phylogenetic emergence. On the other hand, Vygotsky’s neuropsychology does not fully explore the phylogenetic emergence of basic units of functional psychic organisation. This might be due to certain implications of Vygotsky’s initial accounts, which seem to highlight cultural development to the detriment of phylogenetic one.
Parental stress can be debilitating for parents and their families. This is particularly true for parents who have a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other intellectual and developmental disability (I/DD). Effective screening and measurement of parental stress leads to accurate and effective intervention. The purpose of this study was to understand the psychometric properties of the Parental Stress Scale (PSS) for families who have a child with I/DD (ages ranging from 1 to 18 years old, with a mean of 5.28). Caregivers of 3220 families who have a child with I/DD (91% diagnosed with ASD) completed the scale. The psychometric properties including internal reliability and factor structure were completed as well as discriminant validity. Results of confirmatory factor analysis with the 18-item scale revealed a poor model fit with three items not meeting minimum factor loading threshold. Given this, the three items were removed, and confirmatory factor analysis was reconducted with 15 items of the PSS. Results revealed good internal consistency and discriminant validity, as well as a good model fit with all 15 items loading above the minimum threshold. The identified two-factor structure is consistent with the dichotomous (rewarding/burdensome) construct of parental stress that Berry and Jones (J Soc Pers Relationsh 12(3):463–472, 1995) originally designed the scale to index. Thus, the 15-item PSS has initial psychometric evidence in a large sample of families with a child with I/DD.
Trauma-specific care denotes best practice when working with individuals with histories of childhood abuse, maltreatment, or experiences of intimate partner violence. However, youth with autism spectrum disorder and exposure to intimate partner violence characterize a specific subpopulation of trauma-impacted individuals who present unique challenges for practitioners and researchers alike. The comorbidity of trauma and autism spectrum disorder raises a specific practice problem requiring an in-depth understanding of the complex interrelationship of childhood experiences of intimate partner violence, the associated traumatic sequelae, and the neurobiological characteristics of autism spectrum disorder. The current research on the intersectionality of intimate partner violence, trauma, and autism is limited. This paper draws attention to the practice implications of working with adolescent clients with both a history of trauma from childhood exposure to intimate partner violence and a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. The author utilizes a case study to contextualize presenting concerns, prioritize needs, and identify treatment outcomes. A systematized review is used to methodically review the literature on clinical interventions for youth with autism spectrum disorder and trauma. The aim is to draw attention to the gap in the literature as well as provide clinicians with a structured review of the literature on interventions for this unique population. Recommendations include research and tailored interventions to meet the developmental and concrete needs of the client in the present case study and perhaps others who are similarly situated. Clinical and research implications highlight the need for specialized care and further research to meet this underserved population.
The paper critically analyses cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) in two most important aspects - the basic unit of analysis (i.e., in essence, the subject of the theory) and the main epistemological and methodological principles. It is shown with several examples that the concepts and principles that CHAT took from Vygotsky’s theory are absent in Vygotsky’s theory and are ascribed to him by misunderstanding and misinterpretation. One may agree or disagree that cultural-historical theory and activity theory are different theories, despite their historical connections, but Leontiev’s theory has no activity (and the concept of activity! ) as a unit of analysis, because the principle of the unity of consciousness and activity theory represents a completely different logic of analysis, which does not need units of analysis at all.
Following the (revised) latent state–trait theory, the present study investigates the within-subject reliability, occasion specificity, common consistency, and construct validity of cognitive control measures in an intensive longitudinal design. These indices were calculated applying dynamic structural equation modeling while accounting for autoregressive effects and trait change. In two studies, participants completed two cognitive control tasks (Stroop and go/no-go) and answered questions about goal pursuit, self-control, executive functions, and situational aspects, multiple times per day. The sample (aged 18–30 years in both studies) consisted of 21 participants (14 female) in the pilot study and 70 participants (48 female) in the main study. Findings indicated poor within-subject reliability for the Stroop task error rate and reaction time difference between congruent and incongruent trials and moderate to good within-subject reliability for the go/no-go task error rate and reaction time. Occasion specificity—the systematic variance accounted for by state residuals—was at a modest level (between 1.4% and 11.1%) for the Stroop error rate and reaction time difference, and at a moderate level (between 16.1% and 37.2% for the go/no-go error rate and reaction time) in the two studies. Common consistency—the variance accounted for by latent trait variables—was at a moderate to high level for all of the investigated scores. Indicative of construct validity, the Stroop and go/no-go task error rates correlated positively with each other on the within- and between-subject level. Within-subject correlations between task scores and subjective self-control measures were very small and mostly nonsignificant.
This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to estimate the familiarity of words and multi-word expressions (MWEs). We validated LLM estimates for isolated words using existing human familiarity ratings and found strong correlations. LLM familiarity estimates performed even better in predicting lexical decision and naming performance in megastudies than the best available word frequency measures. We then applied LLM estimates to MWEs, also finding their effectiveness in measuring familiarity for these expressions. We have created a list of more than 400,000 English words and MWEs with LLM-generated familiarity estimates, which we hope will be a valuable resource for researchers. There is also a cleaned-up list of nearly 150,000 entries, excluding lesser-known stimuli, to streamline stimulus selection. Our findings highlight the advantages of LLM-based familiarity estimates, including their better performance than traditional word frequency measures (particularly for predicting word recognition accuracy), their ability to generalize to MWEs, availability for large lists of words, and ease of obtaining new estimates for all types of stimuli.
The present study examines whether and why power expectations differentially affect the impulsive buying of hedonic products by powerful and powerless individuals, and how self-acceptance moderates the relationship between power expectations, power experience and impulsive buying of hedonic products. Integrating findings from two different literatures such as normative evaluation of impulsive buying and self-conscious feelings of deservingness, we propose and find that in situations where power expectations are activated, social stereotypes associated with power consumption lead to normative judgments of hedonic impulsiveness, which activate self-conscious feelings of deservingness. Thus, powerless individuals were unable to find a normative justification for hedonic products, had a lower sense of deservingness, and reduced their impulsiveness to purchase hedonic products. In contrast, powerful individuals increased their impulsiveness to purchase hedonic products, and power expectations can act as both catalysts and barriers that shape the impulsive buying behaviour. Furthermore, we find that the above effect is significant when self-acceptance is low. Our study provides a new perspective on power expectations for impulsive buying, which helps to reconcile the controversial findings on power and impulsive buying.
Inclusion can be defined as valuing each individual’s uniqueness and talent, providing equal access to opportunities, and supporting people to meet their potential. Recently, applied behavior analysis (ABA) has been criticized for targeting client behaviors that differ from the majority (e.g., stereotypy). We conducted a survey with 170 behavior analysts to evaluate the degree to which they focus on changing client behavior relative to changing the behavior of others for a behavior of concern that was harmful, disruptive but not harmful, or merely different. Respondents reported that they were more likely to focus on changing client behavior for a harmful behavior than they were for a behavior that was different, although the differences were marginal. The most common response across all questions was to focus equally on both the client’s and others’ behavior. The implications of inclusionary practices related to interventions in ABA services are discussed.
The majority of youth who experience foster care want to go to college. Unfortunately, few achieve their post-secondary goals. Many states have developed programs and policies to increase the level of support available to students who have experienced foster care (SEFC). However, most of these initiatives have not been evaluated. The present study examines two emergent strategies in Texas; a) an unfunded legislative mandate to appoint a liaison on every college/university campus to serve SEFC and, b) a grassroots movement to develop campus support programs for SEFC at particular institutions.  We evaluate these programs and policies using a unique data set that merges historical data from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, academic records from the Texas Higher Education Board, and primary data collected from campus websites and liaison surveys. Our data from 2012–2021 revealed that retention rates for SEFC did not increase in association with the liaison legislation. However, our analysis from the 2020–2021 academic year revealed that students who attended four-year universities with a campus support program had significantly higher retention rates than students who attended comparable schools without these programs (41% higher). However, we did not find a benefit of campus support programs for students attending community colleges. We conclude that higher education support can improve retention rates of SEFC. However, success is not guaranteed, but rather is contingent on funding, execution, and context. We call for ongoing assessment of existing strategies in order to identify best practices for improving post-secondary outcomes of SEFC.
BackgroundSleep is substantial issue for hospital inpatients and can negatively affect healing and recovery. There is a good evidence-base for interventions which can improve sleep, however currently they are not being implemented into NHS practice. To address the evidence-practice gap, we have conducted early-phase development for an inpatient sleep intervention (ASLEEP); a multi-level intervention to improve inpatient sleep in UK hospital wards.MethodsWe used an iterative development process incorporating Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement, ward staff surveys and stakeholder consultations (orthopaedic and acute medicine), and theoretical mapping using behaviour change theories. Development took place in four stages: identification of existing patient-level intervention components to improve sleep in hospital; identification of environmental barriers and facilitators to sleep in hospital; consultation with health professional stakeholders; and final theoretical mapping using the COM-B model and Theoretical Domains Framework, also considering who holds ‘change power’ for each change construct.ResultsWe identified 18 variables contributing to inpatient sleep, which are malleable to change universally across hospital wards. Central domains for change were identified as the ward environment context and resources; to reduce noise from equipment (material resources), and social influence; to modulate staff and patient noise awareness and behaviours (group norms). Change power mapping identified key stakeholders as patients, ward staff, procurement/estates, and NHS management.ConclusionsImproving sleep in hospital requires a whole-systems approach which targets environmental factors, staff behaviour, and patient behaviour. We have provided recommendations for a multi-level intervention, highlighting core areas for change and essential stakeholders who must be involved to progress implementation. The next stage of development will involve operationalising recommendations and piloting, including evaluating mechanisms of change. It will be important to continue working with a broad range of stakeholders to bridge the evidence-practice gap and support sustainable practice adoption.
Impartial altruism is often considered a moral ideal but is rare in practice. Instead, generosity typically decreases as social distance increases, a phenomenon termed social discounting. Most people prefer this partiality in their close relationships and view impartial altruists as poorer relationship partners. This suggests real-world impartial altruism may be rare because it reduces—or is perceived to reduce—the quality of close relationships. To investigate this, we compared patterns of generosity and social relationship quality in a rare sample of individuals who had engaged in extraordinary real-world impartial altruism (altruistic kidney donors; n = 59) and their closest friend or family member (n = 59) to controls (n = 71) and their closest others (n = 71). We designed a direct test of third-party social discounting, which experimentally confirmed real-world altruists’ impartiality, finding that they are more likely than controls to split resources evenly between close and distant others rather than favoring close others. However, we found no statistically significant association between impartial altruism and social relationship quality. Instead, we found that altruists’ close others also show more impartiality than controls. This suggests value homophily (shared moral values) among altruists, which may represent a protective factor for close relationships in the context of impartial altruism.
In the face of increasing cyberbullying incidents on online social networking sites (SNS), there is a growing demand for robust detection and prediction mechanisms to foster a safer digital environment. This paper investigates the performance of several supervised machine learning (ML) classifiers in terms of sentiment analysis and text categorization related to cyberbullying. It introduces frameworks for text pre-processing and classification with multiple cyberbullying classes like religion, age, gender, and ethnicity. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of cyberbullying incidents collected from X (formerly Twitter), this study evaluates multiple supervised learning classifiers to identify the best one with the highest accuracy. The best-performing classifier is then used to develop a robust model for cyberbullying detection and prediction. In addition, feature extraction and model interpretability are achieved to learn more about how these classifiers make decisions when it comes to cyberbullying. The main aim of this research is to contribute practical solutions by identifying the most suitable machine learning models for diverse social networking sites datasets. Through performance evaluation, it is observed that the Random Forest classifier achieves an accuracy of 94%, outperforming the other classifiers and it is selected for the model development. Further, the developed model is trained, tested, and validated on different SNS platform datasets. Finally, the developed model is able to accurately perform detection and prediction of cyberbullying text as per the specified classes. This study has the potential to improve the model by applying deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to effectively detect cyberbullying in cyberspace.
Male victimhood ideology, the belief that men are the primary targets of gender discrimination, has gained traction among young men in recent years, but the underlying sources of these sentiments remain understudied. Utilizing four different datasets, collected in 2015, 2018, 2020, and 2023 from representative samples of Korean men, this study investigates whether identification with male victimhood ideology is explained by objective economic hardships faced by men or by their perceptions of a status loss. The economic hardship perspective finds little support, as men who were less educated, had lower incomes, were unemployed, or had non-regular employment were no more likely to identify with male victimhood than their more economically stable counterparts. Instead, a perceived decline in socioeconomic status relative to one’s parents emerged as a significant predictor of male victimhood ideology, particularly among men from middle to upper class backgrounds. Additional analyses show that this pattern is not observed among Korean women of the same age group. Overall, the analysis of the four datasets consistently shows that male victimhood discourse is embraced most by those who perceive a loss of privilege, rather than by those who are marginalized.
This study explores into the dynamics of global consumer sentiment towards green products, leveraging a dataset of 109,417 Instagram comments to uncover the attributes that drive discussions and evaluations of sustainability on social media. By employing a multifaceted analytical approach that includes sentiment analysis, word frequency, word cloud analysis, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, this research provides a novel perspective on the preferences and concerns of consumers regarding green consumption. The findings reveal that while there is a predominantly positive sentiment towards green products, the importance of various attributes—including eco-friendliness, quality, price, and functionality—varies significantly across different product categories. The study also identifies specific green and non-green attributes that influence consumer evaluations and discusses the comparative impact of these attributes on shaping positive and negative sentiments. The implications of this study underscore the need for targeted strategies that align with consumer values and preferences revealed through social media analytics, contributing to a more sustainable global market for green products.
Self-compassion is increasingly recognized as an adaptive resource for coping with personal distress by reducing the sense of threat and creating feelings of safeness, yet little is known about its developmental origins. We review a broad body of literature examining self-compassion in childhood and adolescence hoping to stimulate developmental research and point to practical implications. Apart from classifying studies in terms of study characteristics (e.g., populations, measures), we categorized all studies according to their research domain(s):psychosocial environment,mental and physical health,achievement or performance, andmindfulness-related constructs. One hundred and forty-one articles – looking at self-compassion as predictor or outcome variable – were identified. We found a sharp increase of publications within the past 10 years. Descriptive analyses of research domains show a strong interest in understanding the relation between self-compassion and mental health, although little is known about the directionality of this relationship and how positive vs. negative (self-criticism) aspects of self-compassion contribute to vulnerability or resilience in young people. Furthermore, inter- and intra-individual factors that may potentially affect the development of self-compassion have been identified. Of interest, studies have retrospectively identified factors within the family (e.g., parenting, attachment) that contribute to individual differences in self-compassion. Longitudinal studies, however, are still scarce. Self-compassion has also been investigated as a potential mechanism of how early trauma impacts later (mal)adjustment. Choosing a broad focus, allowed us to shed light on domains that either have been given attention to or have been neglected in the study of self-compassion in children and adolescents.
Collateral reports on psychopathology improve clinical care and research. Previous research showed moderate agreement between adults’ self- and collateral reports. Factors associated with discrepancies in different age groups, especially the crucial period of emerging adulthood, are yet to be investigated. We examined mother-child agreement and factors associated with discrepancies inN=256 mother-child dyads with emerging adult children (M= 22.3 years) who participated in a longitudinal prevention study (18-year follow-up). Children completed self-report measures on psychopathology (Adult Behavior Checklist, ASR), current psychological distress, and two individual items regarding the mother-child relationship and frequency of contact. Mothers reported on their children’s psychopathology (Adult Behavior Checklist, ABCL) and their own psychological distress. Children and mothers completed a half-structured clinical interview on mental disorders. Agreement between ASR and ABCL was moderate to high (r= .48 to .53). Both reports significantly correlated with children’s diagnoses based on the clinical interview (r= .37 to .58). When children reported higher levels of psychopathology, higher levels of current psychological distress were associated with larger mother-child discrepancies. When mothers reported higher levels of child psychopathology, higher levels of maternal psychological distress, lower relationship quality, and higher frequency of contact were associated with larger discrepancies. Mother-child agreement in emerging adulthood is comparable to agreement in adolescence and adulthood. Factors associated with discrepancies differ for higher maternal- vs. self-reported psychopathology. Maternal psychological distress is more relevant for informant discrepancies than maternal mental disorder diagnoses. Longitudinal studies are needed to enhance the understanding of informant discrepancies.
Sleep problems are common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with potential repercussions on neurobehavioral functioning exacerbating socio-communicative impairments and aggressive behaviors. Parent reports are the most used method to assess sleep in pediatric populations and a modified 23-item of Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) for ASD has been proposed in the United States. The generalizability of the CSHQ for ASD has yet to be validated across countries, including Italy. To extend the CSHQ applicability to Italian youth with ASD, we back-translated to Italian and revised the 23-item CSHQ, validating its dimensional structure in a sample of children and adolescents with ASD using Explorative Graph Analysis. In addition, we compared the revised scale scores of the ASD group with a typically developing (TD) group. The revised Italian version of the CSHQ (CSHQ-r) consisted of a 15-item tool with a four-dimension structure (Sleep initiation/duration, Sleep anxiety/Co-sleeping, Night awakenings/Parasomnias, and Daytime alertness) with good structural stability. Group comparison indicated significantly higher scores in the ASD group than the TD group, suggesting greater prevalence of sleep disturbances in ASD. The four-dimensional CSHQ-r may represent a useful screening tool to assess sleep disorders in Italian children and adolescents with ASD, with potential implications for clinical practice.
The Syrian civil war became a catalyst for numerous psychological issues, especially among children who faced migration and exposure to violence. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) stands out as one of the most prevalent mental health problems among these young survivors. The research outcomes to be presented in this paper aim to investigate the efficacy of art therapy through the self-narrative approach in reducing PTSD symptoms among Syrian war-affected children aged 6 to 12. The study followed a semi-experimental design with a pre-test and post-test, using a control group. Twenty Syrian children from war-affected areas were selected for high scores on the scale that measures the intensity of trauma symptoms. Half received an art therapy intervention. The results revealed that Self-Narrative Art-Therapy significantly contributed to reducing PTSD symptoms, including re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing, and arousal, in Syrian war-affected children aged 6 to 12, making it a viable psychological intervention.
Little is known about the neuropsychological profiles associated with sexual abuse (SA). Using a serial case study design, we examined the cognitive profile from 11 patients medically referred for neuropsychological evaluation who endorsed a remote history of SA. The data can be best summarized as the co-existence of strong psychometric evidence of non-credible responding [operationalized as multiple failures on performance validity tests (PVTs)] and intact (often better than expected) performance on difficult tests designed to measure cognitive ability across various domains. Five (45.5%) of the patients had strong evidence for noncredible responding and another three (27.3%) had indeterminate profiles (i.e., neither clearly valid nor clearly invalid). We propose that the paradoxical co-occurrence of multiple PVT failures and intact cognitive abilities may be a psychometric marker of complex trauma history. Naturally, this hypothesis needs extensive independent replication before it can be incorporated into routine clinical interpretation of neuropsychological data. Given the small sample size and the variability in demographic and clinical characteristics, results are considered preliminary. The effects of developmental timing and recurrence of SA, the survivor-perpetrator relationship, protective factors, and post-traumatic growth on cognitive functioning in people who have experienced SA are discussed. Future research is needed to better understand the long-term effects of SA on the neurocognitive profile of adult survivors. In the meantime, assessors may want to consider complex trauma history as a potential alternative explanation to feigning for multiple PVT failures and unexplained internal inconsistencies within the cognitive profile.
Although the pandemic was adequately managed in Japan, mental health problems, such as school refusal and obesity, continue to increase among adolescents and adults in Japan. This study focuses on how health locus of control (HLOC) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and dietary style may have impacted COVID-19 infection control and their role in the continuation of psychological burden and exhaustion. Specifically, it looks at how pre-pandemic healthcare and parenting styles influenced the burden of COVID-19 infection control through diet and were associated with depressed mood and overeating tendencies in parents of adolescents and young adults. In December 2022, this study was focused on pre-pandemic dietary habits, health management, and parent–child communication and a web survey was conducted among 908 parents with children in junior to senior high school living in metropolitan areas with a population of more than 1 million to determine their depressive mood and tendency to overeat. The results revealed that mothers had a higher burden of COVID-19 infection control than fathers in all three periods, although the fathers’ burden of infection control was more strongly associated with their depressive mood and tendency to overeat from 2020 to 2022. With regard to the HLOC, internal attribution type was negatively associated with infection control fatigue in both fathers and mothers. The attribution style “family” was associated with increased family bonding during the pandemic, whereas both fathers and mothers were more sensitive to food safety, increasing the burden of infection control.
In recent years, organizations have been seeking guidance on how to provide suitable working conditions for their employees. Particular attention is paid to attracting young people starting their careers, who can cope with the significant flow of information and the rapid changes in technology and business. The present study aims to identify the subjective work value orientations of career starters and investigates the presence of work value dimensions established in the literature, as well as the significance of work-life balance among the various orientation types. We applied the rarely used Q-methodology because it can quantify patterns of opinion within a group. Q-set was based on 28 focus groups (n= 154) and the qualitative coding of a one-question questionnaire (n1= 773,n2= 287) focusing on job choice aspects. Participants were Hungarian university students who plan to enter the labour market within 18 months. As a result of Q-sorting (n= 29), the paper presents 6 employee types of career starters according to work values. Intrinsic, extrinsic, convenience and social values and the crucial importance of work arrangements (flexible, remote, or on-site work) are strongly reflected in the work value orientations of young career entrants. As a practical implication for organizations, we highlight the possibility of using work value orientations for the preparation of value propositions and their integration in the recruitment process.
The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship with life events and coping styles, and to explore the intermediary effect of coping styles between negative life events and subthreshold depression. A questionnaire survey of 721 students from a medical university in Anhui Province, China was conducted using a questionnaire on the characteristic coping styles, a scale of youth life events, and a scale of subthreshold depression for university students. Chi-square test andt-test were used to analyze the effects of general demography characteristics on life events, subthreshold depression, and the coping style of university students. The Bootstrap method was used to test the mediating effect of coping styles between negative life events and subthreshold depression. Life events were correlated with subthreshold depression (r= 0.425,P< 0.01), positive coping styles (r= -0.128,P< 0.01) and negative coping styles (r= 0.281,P< 0.01). Subthreshold depression was correlated with positive coping styles (r= -0.327,P< 0.01) and negative coping styles (r= 0.448,P< 0.01). The results of the mediation effect test showed that the mediation effect of positive coping style and negative coping style between life events and subthreshold depression accounted for 10.51% and 27.84% of the total effect values, respectively. Coping styles play a role in mediating between negative life events and subthreshold depression in university students. Education departments should guide students to actively cope with negative life events.
Past research has associated materialism with lower well-being. However, research on the effect of materialism on interpersonal trust and its underlying mechanism is limited. This research investigated how dispositional and situational materialism relate to interpersonal trust, as well as the mediation mechanism proposed based on a social projection account (social projection is a self-referential heuristic in which individuals assume others share similar mental experiences with them). Study 1 explored the associations of dispositional materialism with generalized and particularistic trust. The results showed that dispositional materialism could negatively predict generalized trust and particularistic trust in weak ties but could not predict particularistic trust in strong ties, and trustworthiness mediated the significant associations, aligning with the social projection principle. Study 2 examined the link between dispositional materialism and trust behavior in the trust game. The results showed that dispositional materialism negatively predicted trust behavior through the chain mediation effect of trustworthiness and social expectations about others’ trustworthiness, supporting our predictions based on the social projection account. Study 3 examined the causal relationship between materialism and interpersonal trust by activating participants’ materialistic orientation via situational cues (situational materialism). The results showed that situational materialism caused lower trust behavior, trustworthiness, and social expectations; however, situational materialism could not evoke the chain mediation effect proposed based on the social projection account. Our findings partially support the explanation of materialism-trust relation based on social projection and provide implications for trust promotion practice in the future.
IntroductionAmbulance staff play a crucial role in responding to mental health crises. However, negative regard toward patients with mental health conditions can hinder care. The Medical Condition Regard Scale (MCRS) assesses regards or attitudes but has not previously been validated for educated ambulance staff and has never been translated into Norwegian. This study aims to translate the instrument into Norwegian, test it on a population of ambulance staff, explore the psychometric properties of the Norwegian version, and measure regard for patients with psychosis.MethodThe MCRS is an 11-item instrument with a Likert scale of 1–6. Possible sum scores range from 11 to 66 (higher score = more positive regards). We chose “psychosis” as the condition to investigate. Translation followed eight steps: (1) preparation, (2) forward translation, (3) backward translation, (4) first expert panel review, (5) harmonisation, (6) cognitive debriefing, (7) second expert panel review, and (8) writing of the final version. The instrument was tested and re-tested regarding the condition “psychosis” on a representative sample of 114 Norwegian ambulance staff in 2023, with a temporal gap of one month. We explored item scores and distribution, as well as floor and ceiling effects. We tested the internal consistency of the items using Cronbach’s Alpha and consistency in answers over time (test and re-test) using the Paired Sample-T test. We used factor analyses to explore the inter-item relationships of the items.ResultsThe 114 participants had a mean sum score of 47, which is mid-range. The scale has a ceiling effect on five items, which was not described in detail earlier. Two items regarding the monetary spending on patients with the given condition had the largest ceiling effects. However, the Norwegian translation showed adequate internal consistency (Cronbach’s Alpha = 0.82) and is reliable over time. Test and re-test showed no significant differences in the scale’s total score (Paired sample T-test,p> 0.05). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicate that the scale should be used as a one-dimensional instrument in a Norwegian setting in ambulance staff populations.ConclusionThe Norwegian translation of the MCRS is a reliable instrument for ambulance staff measuring medical condition regards. However, the ceiling effect limits the ability to discern differences among high-scoring individuals. Ambulance staff’s regard for patients with psychosis is medium positive (mid-range level), but slightly more positive than what is reported in the international literature regarding patients with mental health issues.
To produce a theoretical approach about the relations between neuroscience and psychopathology that expands beyond the biomedical model to include a non-reductionist, enactive, and biocultural perspective. An integrative review, drawing from thebiocultural approachfrom Anthropology, is used to produce examples from epigenetics, neuroplasticity, and functional neuroanatomy. A biocultural approach points to a brain that is highly plastic, reinforcing a much more complex model in which biological vulnerabilities and the historical-cultural environment co-construct each other. The examples given seem to point to the pressing need for a critical expansion of reductionist models of psychopathology. Importantly, the cultural-historical environment to which we refer is not a set of neutral social relations to which individuals are homogeneously exposed, such that aspects that are usually studied under the social determinants of health and disease (poverty, discrimination, violence, and other factors that represent sources of control, production, and distribution of material resources, ideology, and power) need to be incorporated in adequate biopsychosocial models of mental distress.
Taking foreign language majors with experience in innovation and entrepreneurship training program (IETP) as samples, this study investigates the influence of disciplinary expertise on entrepreneurial intention. Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), a model was designed to examine the relationships among entrepreneurial intentions, perceived behavioral control, attitude toward entrepreneurship, subjective norms, IETP experience, foreign language self-efficacy and cultural intelligence. The data were collected through questionnaires and Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was adopted to test the hypotheses. The results show that: (1) perceived behavioral control and attitude toward entrepreneurship are sound predictors of entrepreneurial intentions but the influence of subjective norms on entrepreneurial intentions is insignificant; (2) IETP experience is directly related with perceived behavioral control and indirectly related with entrepreneurial intentions; (3) indicators of participants’ disciplinary expertise such as foreign language self-efficacy and cultural intelligence are directly related with IETP experience and indirectly related with entrepreneurial intentions. These six variables included in the research model account for 53.4% of the variance of entrepreneurial intentions.
An increasing number of women are undergoing female genital cosmetic surgery (FGCS). Labiaplasty, the most commonly performed FGCS, consists of a surgical procedure to decrease the inner labia size so that no or less tissue protrudes beyond the outer labia. Anatomically, it is similar to female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) Type 2a. Thus, what are the differences and similarities between FGCS and FGM/C? Even though FGCS is not recommended by most scientific societies, it is considered legal, contrary to FGM/C. Most women seeking FGCS have physiologic (neither diseased nor anatomically atypical) genitalia and are reassured by counseling. We recommend counseling, history taking, screening for relevant conditions, and, if surgery is pursued, medical care by a specialist. We present the cases of three patients who reported feeling genitally mutilated after having willingly undergone FGCS. This feeling led these women to seek care at an outpatient clinic that receives migrants, refugees, second-generation, or naturalized patients originating mainly from African countries having experienced FGM/C. We discuss clinical implications, health insurance coverage, legal, ethical, and social implications. Multiple unresolved issues must be carefully addressed by scientific societies, legislators, and anti-FGM/C advocates to ensure equal treatment of all individuals in relation to genital cutting or surgery. Genital modifications experienced as harmful, or that are performed without informed consent, should be studied in relationship to one another and evaluated with consistent principles, regardless of the skin color of the individuals concerned, their cultural, ethnic, or religious background, or the name given to the genital modification they underwent.
Disgust plays a significant role in pathogen protection, with research highlighting the distinct contributions of various sensory modalities to the complex disgust reaction. In our study, 113 participants touched 6 hidden objects, rating their tactile disgust, fear, and object characteristics. Participants also completed the Disgust Scale-Revised, the Three Domains of Disgust Scale (Pathogen domain), and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease questionnaire; a subsample completed the Culpepper Disgust Image Set. Results showed high correlation of measured tactile disgust with existing questionnaire responses, thus demonstrating the utility of this single-modality approach. A significant role in varying disgust sensitivity elicited by different objects was played by slimy, sticky, and wet characteristics, often characterizing environments associated with pathogen presence, as well as by felt fear and the individual’s “animal reminder” disgust sensitivity. This study enhances our understanding of the tactile aspects of disgust and underscores the interplay between fear and disgust in pathogen defense.
There is an emerging debate around the idea that goals can shape perceptual experiences, guiding people to act in a goal-directed manner. The degree to which a person’s motivation for goal striving is derived from internal versus external sources and aligns with their values, beliefs, and self-concept (i.e., self-concordance) plays an important role in determining successful goal pursuit but has been an overlooked factor in the research surrounding goal-driven perceptual phenomena. In the present experimentn= 66 participants determined whether stimuli depicting crowds of moving people contained 10 or more individuals. We assigned participants to either a threat-goal condition, emphasizing the potential for threat in large crowds, or a control condition which had no additional justification for the task. We measured goal self-concordance for the task and manipulated both the size of the crowd and the proportion of individuals in the crowd performing threatening actions across trials. Self-concordance predicted less accurate responding, with participants over-estimating small crowds and under-estimating large crowds. Additionally, participants with self-concordant motivation in the threat-goal condition had faster reaction times and were less influenced by task instructions. Our findings suggest that the self-concordance of motivation for a task may influence the way participants respond to stimuli, rather than the way they perceive them.
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is more common in households with children than without. Yet, persons who survive IPV and are parents are a marginalized group often neglected by clinical and research discourses alike. Parents who survive IPV are often stigmatized as suboptimal parents due to the challenges they face, indicating the need for clinical assessments that are strengths-based. At present, there is no strengths-based, brief assessment used in clinical practice with this population, and it is imperative that the social work profession develop such a tool. Through this conceptual article, we seek to offer a way forward in providing a strengths-based measure for parenting survivors of IPV. We begin with an overview of the realities of parenting in contexts of IPV and review measures used for persons who survive IPV, and for parents, respectively. We then propose a specific framework for developing a strengths-based assessment tool for parents who survive IPV which has potential to provide more nuanced and targeted support. We conclude with a discussion of clinical social work implications, and advocate for strengths-based approaches in measures as well as all social work interventions.
Adolescence is usually the beginning of externalizing problems. At the same time, as adolescents mature it drives changes in teacher-student relationships. Even though bidirectional associations between teacher-student relationships and cyberbullying perpetration exist, studies examining this link at the within-person level are lacking. This longitudinal study tested the process of influence between teacher-student relationships and cyberbullying perpetration and examined whether teacher-student relationships predicted cyberbullying perpetration by using the random-intercept cross-lagged model. Participants included 2,407 Chinese adolescents (50.23% girl,Mage = 12.75,SD= 0.58 at baseline) from seven schools at three-time points with one-year intervals. Results showed that initial levels and changes of teacher-student relationships significantly predicted cyberbullying perpetration. The relation between teacher-student relationships and cyberbullying perpetration was stable over time at the within-person level, but not at the between-person level. Furthermore, self-esteem significantly predicted cyberbullying perpetration at the between-person level, but not at the within-person level. The results indicate that adolescents with higher teacher-student relationships compared to their own average, tended to be those who later experienced lower cyberbullying perpetration and vice versa. Low self-esteem is not a risk factor for cyberbullying perpetration at the within-person level.
BackgroundThe psychological resilience of university students majoring in long-term-care (LTC)–related disciplines is crucial for workforce retention and effective care provision in this field. This study aims to investigate the differences in levels of psychological resilience among these students in Taiwan.MethodsThis cross-sectional study involved 258 participants selected via stratified random sampling from 23 universities across Taiwan from November 2021 to November 2022, representing a diverse educational context. The research instrument used was the Resilience Scale for Adults, a validated psychological resilience questionnaire. The independent variables included participants’ demographic data, while the dependent variables encompassed five dimensions of resilience: personal strength, family cohesion, social resources, social skills, future organizational style, and total resilience score. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, independent-samples t-tests, analysis of variance, and multiple regression analysis.ResultsParticipants with LTC work experience and leadership roles in campus clubs demonstrated significantly higher scores in personal strength (LTC: t = 2.04,p= 0.04, d = 0.29; leadership: t = 2.89,p= 0.01, d = 0.45), social resources (leadership: t = 2.47,p= 0.01, d = 0.34), social skills (leadership: t = 4.51,p= 0.01, d = 0.62), and future organizational style (LTC: t = 2.72,p= 0.01, d = 0.39). Higher academic performance was linked to greater personal strength, social resources, future organizational style, and total resilience (F = 4.69–3.12,p< 0.05). Regression analysis confirmed the predictive value of leadership experience and LTC work on various resilience dimensions. These results underscore the importance of practical exposure and extracurricular engagement in fostering resilience.ConclusionStudents engaged in club activities, leadership roles, and LTC work displayed higher psychological resilience. Educational institutions should foster club participation, leadership experiences, and partnerships with workplaces to enhance student resilience and professional readiness.
From the evolutionary perspective, maintaining a committed relationship is beneficial for reproductive success but involves risks such as losing a partner or infidelity. People typically prefer partners with similar mate value (MV) to avoid rejection. However, when a mate value discrepancy (MVD) arises, the partner with lower MV might employ mate retention strategies to maintain the relationship. This study investigated whether men with lower MV compared to their female partners used cunnilingus more often and whether this effect was mediated by their motivation to satisfy the partner. Additionally, it tested the moderating role of men’s perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD), predicting that men less concerned about disease would show a stronger link between MVD and cunnilingus frequency, given the health risks associated with oral sex. Data from 540 men in committed heterosexual relationships confirmed that a higher MVD—where the man's MV was lower than his partner's—led to more frequent cunnilingus, and this relationship was mediated by a greater motivation to sexually satisfy the partner. However, the moderating role of PVD was not confirmed. We explore the evolutionary perspective that men may perform oral sex on their partners as a mate retention strategy. This behavior potentially serves as a benefit-provisioning mechanism, compensating for discrepancies in mate value.
BackgroundLoneliness is a common emotional experience among international students that can affect their mental health, cultural adaptation, and academic development. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the relationship between a sense of power and loneliness among international students, and to examine the mediating role of loneliness stigma and perceived discrimination.MethodsThe study used the generalized sense of power scale, experiences with discrimination scale, stigma loneliness scale (SLS), and UCLA loneliness scale-6 (ULS -6) for 529 international students in China. The study conducted descriptive statistical analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, Spearman correlation analysis, and chain mediation model test on the obtained data using SPSS 20.0 and PROCESS v4.0.ResultsThe sense of power was significantly negatively related to perceived discrimination, and loneliness stigma, with the result that loneliness, and perceived discrimination, loneliness stigma, and loneliness were significantly positively related. The sense of power can directly affect international students’ loneliness (β = -0.167, t = -4.298,p< 0.01), or indirectly affect loneliness through three paths: the mediating role of perceived discrimination, the mediating role of loneliness stigma, and the chain mediating role of perceived discrimination and loneliness stigma. The total indirect effect value was -0.234, and the indirect effect values for each pathway were -0.153, -0.059, and -0.022, respectively.ConclusionA sense of power can directly affect loneliness in international students and indirectly by reducing perceived discrimination and loneliness stigma. The results of this study contributed to a better understanding of the relationship between a sense of power and loneliness and its mechanism, providing a reference for carrying on mental health education work for international students.
Many students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have negative social experiences with classmates and teachers. The Making Socially Accepting Inclusive Classrooms (MOSAIC) intervention asked teachers to give positive attention strategies to students at risk for ADHD, at a 3:1 ratio compared to their peers. Evidence suggested that although MOSAIC students at risk for ADHD reported improved relationships with teachers, they were more disliked by their classroom peers, relative to counterparts in a typical practice control group. The current study sought to investigate how classroom peers may have interpreted the teacher strategies. An independent sample of 191 children (ages 5–10; 102 boys) watched video vignettes displaying a teacher using MOSAIC strategies with a student. Participants were randomized into one of four conditions manipulating (a) the ADHD status of the student in the video (ADHD or Neurotypical), and (b) the equality in the teacher’s implementation of the strategies across all students in the class (Equality or Inequality). Results suggested that children believed the teacher to be less genuine when delivering strategies to a student with ADHD relative to a neurotypical student. When teachers delivered strategies unequally (preferentially to the target student) relative to equally across all students, children found the teacher’s actions to be less justified. Children’s ratings of desired social contact with ADHD targets improved after watching the teacher use the MOSAIC strategies, but remained low overall. These findings underscore the importance of assessing children’s interpretations of teacher-delivered intervention strategies, and have implications for future iterations of MOSAIC.
From the evolutionary perspective, maintaining a committed relationship is beneficial for reproductive success but involves risks such as losing a partner or infidelity. People typically prefer partners with similar mate value (MV) to avoid rejection. However, when a mate value discrepancy (MVD) arises, the partner with lower MV might employ mate retention strategies to maintain the relationship. This study investigated whether men with lower MV compared to their female partners used cunnilingus more often and whether this effect was mediated by their motivation to satisfy the partner. Additionally, it tested the moderating role of men’s perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD), predicting that men less concerned about disease would show a stronger link between MVD and cunnilingus frequency, given the health risks associated with oral sex. Data from 540 men in committed heterosexual relationships confirmed that a higher MVD—where the man's MV was lower than his partner's—led to more frequent cunnilingus, and this relationship was mediated by a greater motivation to sexually satisfy the partner. However, the moderating role of PVD was not confirmed. We explore the evolutionary perspective that men may perform oral sex on their partners as a mate retention strategy. This behavior potentially serves as a benefit-provisioning mechanism, compensating for discrepancies in mate value.
According to the recently proposed dark-ego-vehicle principle (DEVP), individuals high in dark-personality traits (e.g., narcissism, psychopathy) tend to be attracted to certain kinds of (political) ideologies if and when these ideologies can be used to satisfy their dark needs. With the present pre-registered longitudinal study, we attempted to falsify the DEVP in the context of antisemitism. In this regard, we predicted positively directed relationships between certain dark-personality traits (i.e., grandiose narcissism, antagonistic narcissism, psychopathy) and antizionist antisemitism. Individuals from several samples from the US and the UK (N= 3,981) completed validated psychometric measures of antisemitic attitudes. This data was correlated with several variables which had already been assessed previously: individuals’ dark-personality traits and specific dark-personality-needs indicators (e.g., aggression, virtue signaling). The results showed a failed falsification of the DEVP: The vast majority of the correlations between the examined dark-personality traits and antisemitism were positively directed. This was not only true for antizionist antisemitism but also for the classical Judeophobic antisemitism. The overall pattern of the found relationships was in line with the DEVP and its assumption that individuals high in dark-personality traits, particularly in antagonistic narcissism and psychopathy, may be attracted to antisemitic ideology.
Empirical findings demonstrate insecure attachment and social cognition deficits play etiological and maintenance roles in some personality disorders. The present study examines the specificity of social cognitive factors and insecure attachment in predicting Borderline (BPD) Personality Disorder versus Avoidant (AVPD) and Antisocial (ASPD) Personality Disorders. Data from a non-clinical adult sample were analyzed using structural equation models to assess the direct relationships between insecure attachment and three forms of personality pathology, as well as the indirect effects through identity diffusion, self-other differentiation, and mentalization as social cognition mediators. Results indicated distinct relationships between insecure attachment and each personality disorder, both directly and as mediated by social cognition factors. Specifically, mentalization mediated anxious and avoidant attachment scores in predicting BPD and identity diffusion mediated anxious and avoidant attachment scores for BPD, ASPD and AVPD models. A unique model for ASPD emerged in that attachment scores were fully mediated in predicting ASPD. Findings indicate social cognition factors account for some of the variance in relationships between insecure attachment dimensions and measures of personality pathology, and that the social cognition contributions vary depending upon the form of personality pathology examined. Implications of these findings for theory, assessment, and treatment are discussed.
Based on Conservation of Resources Theory, this study examines how employee engage in proactive procrastination has an impact on proactive innovative behavior in the context of the psychological mechanism of resource allocate. This study constructed a dual-mediation mechanism for the effect of proactive procrastination on proactive innovative behavior, exploring the mediating role of job crafting and job withdrawal and the moderating role of trait regulatory focus. Our hypotheses were supported by data from 578 employees who frequently engaged in innovative activities. The results suggest that proactive procrastination doesn’t have a direct effect on proactive innovative behavior, but the mediating effects of job crafting and job withdrawal in this process have opposite effects. In addition, trait regulatory focus not only moderated the relationship between proactive procrastination and job crafting as well as job withdrawal, but also moderated the mediating effect of job crafting and job withdrawal, with the path of job crafting being stronger for employees with promotion-focus.
BackgroundThe more rapid adoption of the Internet in education settings has raised concerns about its impact on adolescents who may suffer from cyberbullying victimization. As a negative life experience, cyberbullying victimization can adversely affect adolescents’ mental health. Particularly, it can lead to more adolescents developing depression. Based on this, we developed and tested a moderated mediation model to examine whether approach and avoidance coping strategies mediate the relationship between cyberbullying victimization and depression, and whether this mediating process was moderated by face consciousness.MethodThis study used a cross-sectional survey design with a sample of 1,586 middle school students from northwestern China, including 782 females (mean age 13.76 ± 1.03 years; age range 12–16). Participants completed an anonymous paper-and-pencil survey that assessed their experiences with cyberbullying victimization, approach and avoidance coping strategies, face consciousness, and depressive symptoms.ResultThe findings revealed that cyberbullying victimization (Beta = 0.37,SE= 0.02,p< 0.001) was significantly positively correlated with depression in adolescents. The avoidance coping strategies (Effect = 0.16,p< 0.001), rather than approach coping strategies, mediate the relationship between cyberbullying victimization and depression. Additionally, face consciousness (Beta = 0.05,t= 2.28,p= 0.009) moderated the mediation: as face consciousness increased, the impact of avoidance coping strategies on depression became stronger.ConclusionThese findings provide valuable insights into how and when cyberbullying affects adolescent depression, offering potential guidance for prevention and intervention strategies aimed at reducing the impact of cyberbullying on depressive symptoms in this vulnerable population.
When we encounter an unfamiliar word in a sentence, word order can be used to determine the grammatical category to which that word belongs and clarify ambiguity. However, it is unclear whether a similar categorization effect occurs in nonlinguistic contexts. We created three perceptually distinct categories of shape stimuli—rounded (A); squared (B); pointed (C). Participants were first taught to categorize these shapes, then participants in the experimental condition were trained to select them in a fixed sequence order (A→B→C) while participants in the control condition were allowed to select them in any order. We then generated ambiguous stimuli by morphing shapes from different categories together. In the experimental condition, when an ambiguous morph was presented in a sequence, its subsequent categorization radically shifted based on which shape it replaced. For example, when anABmorph replaced theAshape in a sequence, it was more likely to be categorized asA. By contrast, participants in the control condition, who selected these stimuli without a fixed sequence order, showed no effect, demonstrating the critical role of sequence order and ruling out alternative explanations. These results demonstrate that, even using nonlinguistic stimuli, the position in which an ambiguous stimulus occurs in a sequence drastically impacts how it is subsequently categorized.
The affliction of tumors presents a formidable health challenge all over the world. Meanwhile, the possible therapeutic effects of mindfulness on tumors are gradually being explored. This article aims to conduct a bibliometric investigation into the potential impact of mindfulness on tumors. All related publications on mindfulness and tumors were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Bibliometric analysis tools (Biblioshiny, Citespace, VOSviewer) and Microsoft Excel were employed to draw a knowledge atlas and emerging trends by analyzing the number of articles, authors, countries/regions, institutions, journals, articles, references, and keywords. A total of 1,125 articles on mindfulness and tumors were included from 2013 to 2022, with an annual growth rate of 15.63%. Most of these articles originated from the USA, China, and Canada. Psycho-Oncology and Mindfulness are both significant journals in this field on a global scale. Carlson LE stands out as the most influential, with the highest number of publications and citations. Breast cancer is the most studied cancer in mindfulness-based interventions. Quality of life, stress reduction, depression and anxiety are hot topics of research. Mindfulness may play an valuable role in cancer treatment. Further exploration may focus on the underlying mechanisms of mindfulness on tumors. This bibliometric analysis describes the current state and hotspots in this field and provides crucial leads for future scientific strategies and research directions.
Left-behind children (LBC) in China have a high prevalence of depression and suicide risk. However, the interrelationships between depression symptoms and multi-faceted suicide risk remain unclear. This study aimed to employ network analysis to investigate the intrinsic connections of depression and suicide risk among LBC and non-LBC (NLBC), as well as the disparity in the connections between these two groups. The participants of this research were 2067 middle school students, including 671 LBC (32.56%), 889 males (43.13%), aging from 11 to 20 (Mage= 15.19,SD= 1.62). Their depression symptoms and suicide risk were assessed. Subsequently, their networks including depression and suicide risk symptoms were estimated. Moreover, expected influence and bridge expected influence were calculated to identify core symptoms and bridge symptoms linking depression and suicide risk. Additionally, network comparison was conducted to investigate the disparity between LBC and NLBC. Results identified sadness, depressed mood, suicidal preparation, crying and loneliness as core symptoms for both groups. Defeated and useless was unique core symptom for LBC. Crying, loss of appetite, self-injury and suicidal ideation were bridge symptoms for LBC. Our study identifies the core symptoms and bridge symptoms in the LBC’s depression and suicide risk network, as well as revealing the interrelationships of LBC’s multi-faceted suicide risk. By targeting these symptoms, our findings provide effective guidance for clinical intervention.
This study uses a person-centered analysis approach to explore the latent patterns of perceived parental co-parenting and their relations with adaptive mental health in Chinese junior high school students from a consolidated perspective of the Parental Acceptance-Rejection theory and Family System theory. A total of 899 junior high school students (48.6% were girls) from Chongqing and Changsha in China responded on self-reported measures of perceived parental acceptance-rejection and adaptive mental health, and the data were analyzed using latent profile analysis and regression mixed model analysis methods. The results show that co-parenting patterns with parental acceptance-rejection could be divided into five sub-groups: parental moderate acceptance and low rejection group (31.70%), parental low acceptance and low rejection group (23.69%), maternal moderate acceptance and low rejection with paternal moderate acceptance-rejection group (9.23%), parental high rejection and low acceptance group (7.57%), and parental high acceptance with low rejection group (27.81%). The perception of moderate to high levels of acceptance/warmth is the predominant feeling among current junior high school students toward parental co-parenting, which is most beneficial for their adaptive mental health. Conversely, individuals who perceive high level of parental rejection and low level of acceptance constitute the smallest proportion and exhibit the most adverse outcomes in terms of adaptive mental health. These findings provide theoretical and practical guidance for parents, educators, and counselors to enhance the synergy of warm and accepting co-parenting practices, strengthen parent-child affectionate communication, and ultimately improve the adaptive mental health of Chinese junior high school adolescents.
The importance of interest in learning has long been recognized. Considering the beneficial effects of situational interest (e.g., its potential to develop into individual interest) and its primary dependence on environmental features, numerous empirical studies have explored various situational interest sources (e.g., novelty, utility-value) within learning activities. This review aims to systematically summarize the situational interest sources identified by existing empirical studies based on the four-phase model of interest development (Hidi & RenningerEducational Psychologist,41(2), 111–127,2006) and to synthesize the influence of these sources on learners’ situational interest. Underpinned by the five-stage framework by Arksey and O’Malley (International Journal of Social Research Methodology,8(1), 19–32,2005) and PRISMA extension for scoping reviews ([PRISMA-ScR], Tricco et al.,Annals of Internal Medicine,169(7), 467–473,2018), the current review examined 35 empirical studies on situational interest sources between 2006 and 2022. Six types of situational interest sources (utility-value/relevance/meaningfulness, novelty, cognitive activation/complexity, social interaction, hands-on activity, choice) were extracted from the empirical studies reviewed. The effects of these six types of situational interest sources in different conditions and for different types of learners were demonstrated in the review. Latent sources underlying the proposed types of situational interest sources were also examined. The psychological, cognitive or behavioural rationales underlying the effect of each type of situational interest source and the implications for future research and practice were discussed at the end of the review.
This study investigates the academic productivity of East Asian Sinologists through the lens of cultural psychology. By employing a mixed-methods approach involving qualitative and quantitative analyses, the study investigates Sinological studies across diverse Western cultural backgrounds and the scholarly outputs of East Asian Sinologists.

Face-to-face interviews and questionnaires facilitate in-depth discussions with East Asian Sinologists, capturing their perspectives and cognitive processes. Quantitative analyses, including correlation and regression, unveil a significant influence of shared cultural backgrounds on the research outcomes of East Asian Sinologists. Analysis of survey data and statistical examinations reveals the pivotal influence of cultural factors on Sinologists’ scholarly output. Findings demonstrate a notable correlation between individuals’ cultural identity and academic performance, highlighting the significance of emotional factors in fostering academic creativity. The study underscores the relevance of cultural psychology in comprehending academic productivity and advocates for strengthened cross-cultural research collaboration.
IntroductionLGBT + individuals are less likely to access and utilize healthcare services compared to the general population. Moreover, they are more likely to report unmet healthcare needs due to experiences of heterosexism and cisgenderism within healthcare settings. This systematic review aims to present an overview of the current state of the experiences of LGBT + individuals in healthcare settings across Europe.MethodA systematic search for quantitative and qualitative studies was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. The Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched up to May 2024 to identify eligible records for inclusion in the review. Boolean operators were used to combine terms related to the LGBT + population and their experiences in healthcare settings across Europe.ResultsA total of 29 articles were included in the review, whose results were grouped into three main themes: (1) barriers to accessing healthcare services, (2) cis- and hetero-normativity in perinatal care, and (3) protective factors in healthcare experiences.ConclusionsThe barriers to accessing healthcare services and the perceived need to educate healthcare professionals about their specific health needs often result in LGBT + individuals not receiving adequate care, negatively affecting their health and well-being.Policy ImplicationsA deeper understanding of the processes underlying the healthcare needs of LGBT + individuals should be accompanied by political and social policies that support and promote the fundamental rights of the LGBT + population. This includes ensuring adequate healthcare services free from discrimination and educating healthcare professionals about the specific health needs of the LGBT + community.
PurposeThis study aimed to identify social isolation latent profiles and analyze the specific mechanisms in which social support, resilience, and posttraumatic growth associated social isolation from the perspective of positive psychology. Suggestions were offered to improve the mental health status of postoperative enterostomy patients with colorectal cancer.MethodsThis was a cross-sectional survey. From December 2022 to September 2023, convenience sampling was used to select 303 enterostomy patients from three hospitals in Guangzhou. A paper questionnaire was used to investigate their levels of social support, resilience, posttraumatic growth, and social isolation. T-test, ANOVA, Pearson Correlation Analysis, Latent Profile Analysis and Conditional Process Analysis were used to analyze the correlation between variables.Results(1) Education level, occupation, family monthly income per capita and times of changing enterostomy bag per week were significantly associated with social isolation. (2) Social isolation of patients included low alienation-fluctuation group (Class 1, 13.9%), medium group (Class 2, 64.0%), high alienation-low meaning group (Class 3, 22.1%). (3) Social isolation was negatively correlated with social support, resilience, and posttraumatic growth (P< 0.001). (4) Resilience played a mediating role in the association between social support and social isolation. (5) The second half path of the mediation model was moderated by posttraumatic growth.ConclusionsClinical staff, community personnel and family members should pay attention to the potential differences in social isolation experienced by patients. Suitable psychological strategies should be employed to enhance resilience, promote posttraumatic growth, for improving the patients’ mental health levels and help them return to society.
Psychological resilience is the capacity of individuals to adapt to stress, trauma and adversity, and this process is based on the interaction of biological, psychosocial, ecological and cultural systems as well as individual characteristics. In addition, this multidimensional approach emphasizes that resilience depends not only on individual capacities but also on environmental and social supports. Therefore, the research aims to look at the mediating role of hope and loneliness between social support and psychological resilience. 309 female university students between the ages of 18–23 participated in the study. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to test the mediation dimension of the research data. According to the results, a parallel mediating role of hope and loneliness was found between social support and psychological resilience. In the model, it was observed that hope increased with the increase in social support, loneliness decreased and thus psychological resilience increased. Strengthening social support networks increases the psychological resilience of individuals by reducing loneliness while instilling hope in individuals. It is important in terms of resilience to carry out activities that increase the social support of individuals faced with problems.
BackgroundRural older adults experience a high burden of depressive symptoms and significant barriers to accessing mental health services. The Modified Behavioral Activation Treatment (MBAT) has been verified to be effective among rural older adults in China. Due to its structured format and skill-based learning, it is well suited for digital-based delivery. However, only a few studies were from developed countries, and the evidence to support its application in rural China still needs to be provided. Thus, based on the fact that digital health technology has the potential to address the shortage of healthcare resources and the constraints of community mental health services in rural China, the effectiveness of the digital MBAT (D-MBAT) program among rural older adults is worth further evaluation.MethodsA multi-center randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 216 rural older adults from Huayuan County and Fenghuang County in Western Hunan. The intervention group will receive the D-MBAT program, while the control group will receive routine care. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, social health, quality of life, and satisfaction will be measured at baseline, one-month, and three-month follow-ups to evaluate the digital MBAT program’s effectiveness.DiscussionExisting digital psychological intervention strategies seldom take into account the needs and preferences of the older adults in low-resource rural areas. Thus, this study aims to develop a D-MBAT program based on person-centered and community-engaged approach to maximize the mental health service of rural older adults with depressive symptoms.A successful D-MBAT program would be a feasible and scalable approach to the management of prevalent mental health conditions of rural older adults in resource-limited Western Hunan.Trial registrationChinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2400091193.

The current research addresses two related theoretical questions: 1) do feelings of authenticity experienced during an activity predict motivation to engage in that activity, and 2) does that motivation translate to actual engagement behavior? We examined both questions in a 12-week longitudinal study preceding and following the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Each week we assessed feelings of authenticity, motivation for civic engagement, and self-reported civic engagement. Results showed that the felt authenticity of civic engagement predicted greater engagement motivation, which, in turn, predicted higher engagement frequency the following week. Overall, these findings demonstrate the relevance of authenticity for important social outcomes and yield new theoretical insights into the nature of subjective authenticity.
While abstraction is one of the best studied topics in psychology, there is little consensus on its relationship to valence and affect. Some studies have found that abstraction is associated with greater positivity, while other studies have led to the opposite conclusion. In this paper we suggest that a substantial part of this inconsistency can be attributed to the polysemy of the term abstraction. To address this problem, we use a framework developed by Iliev and Axelrod (Journal of psycholinguistic research, 46(3):715–729, 2017), who have proposed that abstraction should not be treated as a unitary construct, but should be split instead in at least two components. Concreteness is based on the proportion of sensory information in a concept, while precision is based on the aggregation of information corresponding to the concept’s position in a semantic taxonomy. While both of these components have been used as operationalizations of abstraction, they can have opposite effects on cognitive performance. Using this framework, we hypothesize that when abstraction is defined as a reduction of precision, it will be associated with greater positivity, but when it is defined as lack of concreteness, it will be associated with less positivity. We test these predictions in a novel study and we find empirical support for both hypotheses. These findings advance our understanding of the link between abstraction and valence, and further demonstrate the multi-component structure of abstraction.
In the attentional blink paradigm, participants attempt to identify two targets appearing in a rapidly presented stream of distractors. Report accuracy is typically high for the first target (T1) while identification of the second target (T2) is impaired when it follows within about 200–400 ms of T1. An important question is whether T2 is processed to a semantic level even when participants are unaware of its identity. We examined this issue in three studies that used natural scenes as stimuli and the N400 component of the event-related potential (ERP) as a measure of semantic priming. In the first experiment, the prime (e.g., a doghouse in a yard) was presented at the beginning of the trial and a test picture that was related (e.g., a dog standing in the kitchen) or unrelated (e.g., a coffee mug on a table) appeared as T2. In the second experiment, the prime was presented as T2 and the test picture appeared at the end of the picture sequence. In both experiments, we found robust semantic priming when participants were aware of the identity of the blinked picture and an absence of priming when they were unaware. In Experiment3, we used identity priming to assess whether earlier representations preceding semantics were preserved, and again found that priming critically depended on awareness of the prime’s identity. These results suggest that semantic priming in scenes, as measured with the N400, is a higher-level process that critically depends on attention and awareness.
BackgroundTraditional cognitive assessments, often reliant on paper-and-pencil tests and professional evaluators, suffer from subjectivity and limited result discrimination. This study introduces the Baguan Online Cognitive Assessment System (BOCAS), a tablet-based system that evaluates both general cognitive ability (GCA) and domain-specific functions across six domains: sensory-motor skills, processing speed, sustained attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and spatial ability.MethodsBOCAS was validated with 151 healthy Chinese adults aged 18–40. Reliability was assessed through internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to validate the model. The GCA score was correlated with the Raven IQ test and self-reported cognitive flexibility, and its relationship with negative emotions (depression and anxiety) was examined.ResultsBOCAS showed satisfactory reliability, with internal consistency ranging from 0.712 to 0.846 and test-retest reliability from 0.56 to 0.71. Factor analysis revealed a common factor explaining 40% of the variance, and CFA indicated a good model fit (χ²/df = 1.81; CFI = 0.932). The GCA score strongly correlated with the Raven IQ test (r= 0.58) and was related to self-reported cognitive flexibility and negative emotions.ConclusionBOCAS offers a digital solution for cognitive assessment, providing automated, remote, and precise evaluations. It demonstrates reliability, validity, and potential for use in clinical and research settings.
BackgroundSuicide prevention programs delivered in school settings have been shown to reduce suicide attempts and ideation among adolescents. School-based digital interventions targeting at-risk youth are a promising avenue for suicide prevention, and some evidence has shown that blending digital and face-to-face components may improve the effectiveness. However, further evidence is needed, especially in Latin America, where mental health support is limited. We tested the effectiveness of the Reframe-IT+, a blended cognitive behavioral indicated intervention to reduce suicidal ideation, designed to be delivered in school settings. It includes 13 sessions, combining eight internet-based sessions and five face-to-face sessions.MethodsWe conducted a cluster RCT and delivered the Reframe-IT + among secondary students attending Years 9–11. We recruited 21 schools that were randomized into two groups: (1) Intervention Reframe-IT + Group (IG) (n= 863) and (2) Control Group (CG) (n= 683). All consented students completed online screening self-reported questionnaires at baseline. The primary outcome was suicidal ideation . Additionally, we tested the impact of the intervention on depressive and anxiety symptoms, hopelessness, and emotion regulatory strategies, including social solving-problems skills, behavioral activation, cognitive reappraisal, and emotion suppression. A total of 303 students (IG,n= 164; CG,n= 139) were identified as at risk and eligible for inclusion in the study. From those, 224 students (IG,n= 123; CG,n= 101) and their caregivers were interviewed to confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 48 and 47 students were allocated to control and intervention groups, respectively, and answered the online questionnaires at post-intervention. We performed an intention-to-treat analysis using repetitive measures and multilevel regression analyses.ResultsWe found a significant reduction in suicidal ideation (b=-6.7,p= 0.015, Cohen´s d = 0.49), depressive (b=-3.1,p= 0.002, Cohen´s d = 0.81) and anxiety (b=-2.60,p< 0.001, Cohen´s d = 0.72) symptoms, and hopelessness (b=-3.7,p< 0.001, Cohen´s d = 0.70) in the intervention group compared to the control group at post-intervention. We also found improvement in solving-problems skills (b=-1.6,p= 0.002, Cohen´s d = 0.58), behavioral activation (b = 2.8,p= 0.019, Cohen´s d = 0.47), and cognitive reappraisal (b = 2.2,p= 0.029, Cohen´s d = 0.53). In the exploration of the intervention mechanisms concerning suicidal ideation, the total indirect effect of the intervention (b = -5.727923;p= 0.008) was significant, whereas the direct effect (b = − 0.03195473,p= 0.903) was not significant (Suppl 2, Table 1). Problem-solving skill (b=-2.84,p= 0.016) was a significant mediator of intervention effects on suicidal ideation (Path a*b).ConclusionsThis is the first clustered RCT evaluation of the effectiveness of a blended indicated intervention to prevent suicidality in school settings in Latin America. This is the first step to informing policymakers to scale up an effective intervention for an important public health problem.Trial registrationClinical Trials NCT05229302.

Accurate parental praise and criticism congruent with child performance—often ignored—might have lasting impacts on child development. This study explored whether the levels of the accuracy (from deflated to accurate to inflated) of parental praise and criticism perceived by children linked to a risk for their maladjustment (i.e., showing negative affect, failure-is-debilitating mindset, and academic self-handicapping) in a nonlinear way and perfectionism acted as a mediator. Data were collected on 1230 early adolescents (44.9% girls;Mage= 11.0 years,SD= 1.6) who resided in Chinese county towns with their parents. Applying polynomial regression and response surface analysis (RSA), the results showed that (a) Chinese children perceived parents’ tendency to slightly overpraise and overcriticize them; (b) perceptions of inflated and deflated parental praise and criticism were associated with higher levels of maladjustment outcomes; and (c) perfectionism played a mediating role in some cases. This study reveals the nonlinear and combined effects of the accuracy of parental praise and criticism and emphasizes the benefits of parental feedback commensurate with children’s actual performance.
Variable-centered studies have revealed how parental psychological control impacts adolescents’ mental health, but person-centered research on the subgroups of parental psychological control and the relations of the subgroups with mental health over time is limited, particularly for non-Western cultures. This two-wave study aims to identify the subgroups of parental psychological control for Chinese adolescents over a year using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) and Latent Transition Analysis (LTA), and to examine symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress across the subgroups. A total of 906 adolescents (60.04% for female;Mage= 13.59,SD= 0.73) participated in and completed two surveys. The results showed three profiles and nine transition patterns of parental psychological control between Time1 and Time2. Girls were more likely to be present in Low-Control group than boys. The control growth groups and the control decline groups experienced asymmetrical changes in symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. The findings suggest the importance to recognize the early signs of parental psychological control for implementing the prevention and intervention as early as possible.
Disgust, a fundamental human emotion, is triggered by unpleasant stimuli. Previous research has demonstrated its influence on judgments of both moral and non-moral behaviors. This study addresses the gaps in existing literature and controversies by investigating the impact of disgust on immoral and non-moral behavior using the emotional priming paradigm and Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT). Additionally, the study examines how individuals’ propensity for disgust affects moral judgment. The findings reveal that, compared to neutral priming, participants exhibit a greater tendency to avoid non-moral behaviors when primed with disgust. This is evidenced by a higher Avoidance-Approach Rate D-value. Furthermore, a positive correlation is observed between individuals’ disgust propensity scores and the Avoidance-Approach Rate D-value for non-moral behaviors under disgust priming. These results support the moralization hypothesis and highlight the link between disgust and moral judgment.
Working from home has become common in the era of digital intelligence, highlighting the increasing prominence of self-leadership. However, the effectiveness of self-leadership in this new work context has not been thoroughly examined. In addition, the potential “dark side” of self-leadership has been ignored by previous studies. Under ego depletion theory, the present study explored the relationship between self-leadership and work performance and the mediating role played by ego depletion, as well as the moderating role played by workplace type. The questionnaire mainly distributed through the online platform, supplemented by on-site questionnaires, 336 sets of leader-employee paired questionnaires from China were identified using the cross-sectional sampling method. The hierarchical analysis results supported our hypothesized model that: (1) employees’ self-leadership positively affects their work performance; (2) ego depletion has a competitive mediating effect between self-leadership and work performance; and (3) workplace type moderates the competitive mediating effect between self-leadership and work performance, and the positive effects of self-leadership weaken when working from home. These findings provide theoretical implications for future research and practical implications for organizations.
Relationships with adults in organized activities play a crucial role in the positive outcomes associated with these experiences, yet little is known about how these relationships evolve throughout adolescence or how they are differentially associated with mental health. Important distinctions could also be made regarding activity types. The sample consisted of 292 participants (58% female; M age = 12.5; SD = 0.48), primarily White, middle-class, French-Canadian adolescents. Participants reported annually on their relationships with adults from ages 14 to 17. They also provided information on their levels of depressive symptoms and self-esteem at ages 13, 17, and 18. Results showed that parental involvement and support from the activity leader significantly decreased over time during adolescence. Additionally, parental involvement appears to be higher over time in team sports than in non-sport activities, but no differences were found regarding support from the activity leader. Finally, parental involvement and leader support were both linked to lower depressive symptoms and higher self-esteem. These findings highlight the critical yet diminishing role of adults in organized activities as adolescents age, underscoring the need for sustained adult engagement to promote positive mental health outcomes in this developmental period.
BackgroundImproving care for SEED-AN patients is urgently needed. Current specialist eating disorder (SEDU) programs have minimal impact, resulting in poor quality of life. Flexible assertive community treatment (FACT) focuses on improving the quality of life of people with severe mental illness.AimThis study systematically examined professionals’ and patients’ experiences with existing care for SEED AN in two settings in two health districts in the Netherlands. Specifically, the specialised Eating Disorder Unit and FACT.MethodsA qualitative approach was used: Twelve professionals participated in focus groups, and four professionals and six patients were interviewed individually. Reflective thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.ResultsFour themes were constructed: “Wefeel ignorant in the treatment of SEED-AN patients”; “There is a disability to act”; “We are more than executive practitioners alone”; and “The professionals at FACT have given me back my confidence intreatment”. The findings reflect how support for SEED-AN patients is provided by both FACT and SEDU professionals and how SEED-AN patients experience the FACT approach.DiscussionA resource group model promotes collaboration among professionals, patients and the patient’s support system. The model is expected to increase knowledge about SEED-AN among stakeholders who support the quality of life of SEED-AN patients.
ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate a range of insomnia-related factors, including difficulty with sleep induction, nocturnal awakenings, early awakenings, total sleep time, overall sleep quality, well-being, functioning, and daytime drowsiness, to determine which variables were significantly associated with subsequent adolescent suicide attempts.MethodA total of 782 students aged 11–16 years old from one middle school in Changsha, China completed the survey at baseline and 6 months follow-up with a prospective cohort design. The binary logistic regression models were used to analyze the associations between insomnia variables and suicide attempts during the 6 months follow-up.ResultsThe new incidence rate of suicide attempts was 4.60% (36/782) at 6-month follow-up. Insomnia was a significant predictor of incident suicide attempts (OR = 6.00; 95%CI, 2.47–14.60). After adjusting for age, gender, nationality, stress, anxiety and depression, insomnia was found to predict suicide attempts only among female (OR = 4.28; 95%CI, 1.41–12.98) and only nocturnal sleep disruption was significantly associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts (OR = 2.74; 95%CI, 1.32–5.71).ConclusionsNocturnal sleep disruption are independently associated with increased risk of suicide attempts. Intervention for nocturnal sleep disruption may be important for early identification as well as prevention of adolescent suicide, especially among adolescent girls.
IntroductionAlthough the association between being a victim of image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) and psychological maladjustment has been documented in previous research, studies on variations in the rates and consequences of this phenomenon as a function of certain sociodemographic variables are scarce. In the present study, we aimed to analyze the frequency of nonconsensual pornography and sextortion throughout the lifespan and to analyze whether the relationship between being the victim of some types of IBSA and suffering its possible psychological repercussions varies according to gender, age, and sexual orientation.MethodThe study sample comprised 2,748 Spaniards (range, 14–79 years;M= 25.69,SD= 10.17), who completed self-report instruments on IBSA and the related psychological outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depression, and poor self-esteem).ResultsOur findings revealed that 15.1% of the study participants reported IBSA victimization. Women and young people were more likely to experience IBSA than men and older people, respectively. Sexual minorities were also particularly vulnerable to this type of victimization. The studied IBSA types were significantly related to higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms and lower self-esteem. Moderation analysis revealed that compared to younger adults, older adults showed a stronger association between being a victim of nonconsensual pornography and depressive symptoms.ConclusionsOur study highlights the need to prevent the potential adverse outcomes of IBSA by focusing on the most vulnerable populations.Policy ImplicationsThe study findings point to the importance of extending IBSA awareness campaigns beyond adolescence, as adults are also victims and suffer severe consequences.
BackgroundThis study examined how university students’ social media use is related to their mental health (subjective well-being [SWB] and loneliness) and perceived physical health. A cognitive bias model and a social network mediation model were used to compare social capital formed via face-to-face and online communication, considering the effects of personality traits (i.e., social skills, generalized trust, and social tolerance).MethodsWe conducted a self-report survey with 409 university students in Japan from August to September 2022. Four patterns of social media use were analyzed: (1) Twitter only, (2) LINE + Twitter, (3) Instagram + Twitter, and (4) Discord + Twitter. Relationships between the variables were investigated with a structural equation modeling analysis using SmartPLS 4.0.ResultsOverall, regardless of social media use patterns, personality traits had positive direct effects on mental health and also had positive effects on social capital via face-to-face (FTF) communication, which had mediating effects on the improvement of mental health. FTF social capital had a positive relationship with online social capital, which did not have relationships with mental or perceived physical health. Additionally, perceived physical health decreased loneliness but was not associated with SWB. Social media use negatively affected perceived physical health but had no effect on SWB or loneliness. Finally, different relationships between personality traits and social media use, FTF social capital and SWB, social media use and perceived physical health were observed among the four patterns of social media use.ConclusionThis study has implications for improving the health of young adults in the “mobile x social era.” In particular, we provide suggestions to help young adults improve their mental health.
This study aimed to investigate the influence of metaphoric language intervention (MLI) on students’ psychological perception in bilingual learning, focusing on both autistic and students with non-autism. Students with autism often exhibit apprehension toward engaging in bilingual learning with their peers, resulting in reduced enjoyment and unfavorable language learning outcomes. A cohort of 108 students with autism and 102 students with non-autism, who demonstrated psychological perception engagement through MLI, was recruited for the study. The findings revealed that autistic male students reported higher levels of enjoyment in MLI compared to autistic female students, with metaphoric expressions being preferred over literal ones. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between the quality of MLI and increased psychological perception, receptiveness, and enjoyment in bilingual learning, leading to favorable perceptual outcomes for students with autism. These findings highlight the critical role of integrating MLI and implementing targeted psychological perceptions to enhance the quality of bilingual learning for students with autism. This approach shows promise as a practical and universally applicable language therapy that effectively addresses challenges in bilingual learning and fosters a deeper interest in communication, particularly among individuals with autism.
Research shows that both-sex attracted adults have poorer mental health than other- and same-sex attracted adults, but evidence regarding whether similar disparities exist among adolescents remains limited. To investigate this, the current study examines differences in life satisfaction and emotional problems between both-, other- and same-sex attracted adolescents. It also studies whether bullying victimization can explain these differences and whether the associations vary by gender and age. Cross-sectional data from the nationally-representative Dutch Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) study conducted in 2017 and 2021 were analyzed, including 11,683 adolescents (Mage= 14.7, SD = 1.60; 49.7% girls). Both-sex attracted adolescents (n= 507, 4.3%) report lower life satisfaction and more emotional problems than their other- (n= 10,930, 93.6%) and same-sex attracted peers (n= 246, 2.1%). Bullying victimization partially explains the mental health disparities between both- and other-sex attracted adolescents, yet does not account for differences between both- and same-sex attracted peers. The links between romantic attraction and mental health outcomes were similar across gender and age, but differences existed concerning bullying victimization. The results suggest that both-sex attracted adolescents are a unique group that deserves special attention in the literature on mental health disparities.
This study examined informative and uninformative anchoring effects on judgments of learning (JOLs), focusing on two hypotheses: the optimistic/pessimistic and differential-scaling hypotheses. The optimistic/pessimistic hypothesis states that anchoring information changes subjective confidence in memory, whereas the differential-scaling hypothesis states that anchoring information elicits a scaling bias in the conversion process of subjective internal confidence into scale JOLs (i.e., 0–100% responses). Experiment1focused on binary JOLs (i.e.,Yes/Nopredictions). The results confirmed that the informative anchoring effect occurred (i.e., binary JOLs in the high anchor condition were higher than those in the low anchor condition), whereas the uninformative anchoring effect did not. Experiment2evaluated whether the difference in response scales between anchoring information and JOLs elicited the anchoring effect, demonstrating that the informative anchoring effect occurred when different response scales were used for the anchoring information (i.e., the number of words correctly recalled) and JOLs (i.e., 0–100% scale), and the uninformative anchoring effect did not. Experiment3examined whether the uninformative anchoring effect can be explained by numeric priming rather than scaling bias, demonstrating that anchoring information unrelated to test performance using a 0–100% scale did not elicit the uninformative anchoring effect. These findings suggest that the informative anchoring effect supports the optimistic/pessimistic hypothesis, whereas the uninformative anchoring effect supports the differential-scaling hypothesis. Thus, the nature of anchoring information affects the process of forming JOLs. Specifically, the uninformative anchor elicits only scaling bias, whereas the informative anchor changes subjective confidence in memory.
BackgroundAccruing evidence suggests that personality-based approaches to eating disorder classification may offer several advantages over current diagnostic models, with prior research consistently identifying three personality-based groups characterized by either (1) high levels of impulsivity and dysregulation (termed the “undercontrolled” group), (2) high levels of rigidity and avoidance (termed the “overcontrolled” group), or (3) relatively normative levels of personality functioning (termed the “low psychopathology” group). Cognitive inflexibility (i.e., difficulty adjusting thoughts or behaviors) has theorized relevance to eating disorders. However, prior research has frequently failed to observe differences in cognitive inflexibility across eating disorder diagnostic groups. The present study aimed to identify personality-based groups in an eating disorder sample, and then to examine the relations between these groups and behavioral measures of cognitive inflexibility.Method83 men and women who metDSM-5criteria for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa completed self-report questionnaires to assess trait-level approach/avoidance behaviors and impulsivity, as well as behavioral tasks assessing attentional set-shifting and reversal learning, two facets of cognitive inflexibility.ResultsLatent profile analysis of measures assessing approach/avoidance behaviors and impulsivity supported a three-class model replicating the undercontrolled, overcontrolled, and low psychopathology groups. Notably, the low psychopathology group was characterized by elevated reward responding. One-way ANOVAs indicated that the low psychopathology group demonstrated heightened perseverative errors (an indicator of impaired reversal learning) relative to the other groups. No group differences were observed for attentional set-shifting errors or probabilistic switch errors.DiscussionFindings from the present study provide additional support for personality-based classification approaches identifying undercontrolled, overcontrolled, and low psychopathology eating disorder groups. Results also suggest that reward-related processes may contribute to disorder maintenance in the low psychopathology group, indicating potentially meaningful targets for intervention.
BackgroundCognitive bias plays a crucial role in the onset and persistence of depression. Research has established a link between personality traits and cognitive bias; however, most of them focused on the general population, overlooking individuals with depression. We aim to explore the relationship between personality and cognitive bias in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and compare the results with healthy controls (HCs) to identify potential patterns.MethodsThe study included 124 patients with MDD and 123 HCs recruited from the Zhumadian Psychiatric Hospital in Henan, China, using the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire (16 PF) to measure personality traits and the Cognitive Bias Questionnaire (CBQ) to measure cognitive biases. Pearson correlations and hierarchical regression analyses were employed to investigate the correlations and predictive powers.ResultsTraits related to neuroticism or extraversion were associated with biased responses. After controlling for sociodemographic and clinical information, neuroticism traits were found to have a significant independent effect in the MDD group. Also, the significance of Privateness in the MDD group merits more extensive exploration. Although consistent correlation patterns were found in both groups, neuroticism traits were more significant and independent in predicting biased cognitive processing in the MDD group, indicating the importance of neuroticism in the depressive context.ConclusionsThe present study provides insights into the connection between personality and cognitive bias from a clinical perspective, potentially enhancing clinical diagnosis and treatment modalities.
Emotions typically exert an influence on individuals’ purchase decisions. Prior research has established those specific emotions influence decision-making, but there is limited understanding of how purchasing behavior varies between contrasting emotions (positive and negative emotions). This study aims to examine variations in purchasing decisions based on different emotional states. Four contextual studies identify the channeling mechanism for the effects of different emotions on purchase decisions, and consumers with positive emotions purchase more. Positive emotions hinder the processing of information, making consumers’ decisions more arbitrary and simpler. Whilst negative emotions facilitate the processing of information and make the decision more rigor. In addition, it was found that consumers with positive emotions prefer hedonistic products, while those with negative emotions prefer utilitarian products. At the same time, the three-way interaction of emotions, product type and product involvement significantly impact the purchase decisions. In high product involvement, consumers’ purchase intention was higher under positive emotions for hedonic products and for utilitarian products under negative emotions. In low involvement, there is no difference.
Evidence shows psychological factors (e.g. stress) are linked to immunity, yet there is a lack of research investigating the complex interactions between psychological factors and immune function. Network analysis is useful to investigate complex interrelations between relevant health-related variables. This study applied network analyses to examine associations between psychological protective factors (mindfulness, quality of life, positive affect, resilience) and risk factors (depression, anxiety, stress) and self-reported immune functioning in samples from New Zealand (n= 1039), India (n= 384), and Italy (n= 1061). In the overall and country-specific networks, anxiety was consistently associated with poor immunity. In New Zealand and India, but not Italy, health-related quality of life was positively associated with stronger immunity. Depression, anxiety and stress were strongly interlinked in all samples. Depression was also linked to poor quality of life and poor resilience, and anxiety to mindfulness. These findings suggest that anxiety is uniquely linked to immune function across cultures and highlights the potential to address anxiety to improve immunity. The positive quality of life-immunity association in New Zealand and India, but not Italy, suggests cultural differences may play a role, warranting consideration in future research, with a view to inform culturally appropriate interventions. Overall, psychological factors demonstrate consistent connections with immune function cross-culturally. Cultural nuances in the quality of life-immunity link deserve further investigation to inform localized immune function interventions.
Despite evidence that associations between autonomic nervous system (ANS) responsivity and psychopathic traits vary across stress task only a single study has systematically assessed cross-task differences in associations. To advance this limited literature the current study randomized subjects into either a noise blast (countdown) task or a social stressor speech task (SSST). Analyses tested associations between ANS (heart rate, skin conductance) and measures of psychopathic traits (Self-Report Psychopathy Scale-III (SRP-III), Inventory of Callous-Unemotional (ICU) traits, Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP), Sensation Seeking Scale– Form V (SSS-V)). Baseline skin conductance was negatively associated with Erratic Lifestyle (SRP-III) and SSS-V total scores. Heart rate during the SSST had a negative association with Callous Affect (SRP). During the countdown task there was a negative association between skin conductance in anticipation of signaled noise blasts and Interpersonal Manipulation (SRP), and a negative association between change in heart rate after noise blasts in unsignaled trials and Erratic Lifestyle (SRP) and Factor 2 Psychopathy (LSRP).
Building trust is always seen as a firm’s long-term goal. Yet, little is known about creating a credible brand by taking brand name pronounceability design as the starting point. Diverse strategies of brand name pronounceability design widely exist in marketing practice; some are fairly easy to pronounce, while others are strange and mouthful (e.g., “Deloitte” versus “Ernst & Young”). Three main studies were conducted to explore the effect. Drawing on the perceptual fluency/misattribution (PF/M) model, the current research suggests that brand name pronounceability boosts misattribution to ad truthiness, leading to better evaluations of brand credibility. However, this influence does not extend to contexts when the brand name is subtly presented. This research (1) provides deep insight into the dimensions of brand name pronounceability, (2) refines the application perspectives of the PF/M model, and (3) critically supplements the research stream of brand name pronounceability aftereffects. Also, our findings provide practical guidance for marketers and brand managers.
Low libido is a common and potentially distressing problem among midlife and older women. We recently reported results from a pilot randomized controlled trial of a mindfulness intervention for midlife and older cisgender women with low libido; the purpose of this qualitative investigation is to illustrate women’s experiences with being recruited for, enrolling in, and participating in the trial. We conducted individual interviews with a subset of trial participants, some of whom attended a group-based mindfulness intervention and some attended an educational control group (N= 25). We also interviewed participants who were enrolled but did not attend any groups (N= 9). A semi-structured interview guide was developed by the study team. A co-investigator with qualitative research expertise and the primary investigator conducted interviews, which were audio recorded and transcribed. We used a thematic analysis approach to analysis, co-coding a subset of interviews to develop and refine a codebook, then assigning codes to all data. Codes were grouped into subthemes and themes and key insights were extracted. Three key themes emerged from women who attended groups. First, women were interested in the intersection of sexuality and mindfulness. Second, women in both groups valued the sense of community they gained from participating; the interactive nature of sessions contributed to this. Third, experiences with attending groups over videoconferencing software were largely positive. Suggestions for improvement included a better explanation of the randomization process and more didactic information about sexuality and aging in both groups. Non-attendees listed time conflicts as their top reason for not attending. We recommend researchers consider utilizing a group format when designing behavioral interventions for midlife and older women, as this design offers many benefits for participants, but ensuring that a qualified professional is present can ensure information exchanges is evidence-based. In addition, healthcare systems can consider building in opportunities for midlife women to gather and exchange information regarding health.
Spatial-Numerical Associations(SNAs) refer to the demonstrations of spatial processing of numbers. TheMental Number Line(MNL) is a representation model describing numbers as aligning left-to-right (LR) and was suggested to account for directional biases in participants’ responses during numerical tasks. One common behavioral demonstration of this is theSpatial-Numerical Associations of Response Codes(SNARC) effect, which describes faster left-/right-hand responses to smaller/larger numbers, respectively. The MNL, and, consequently, directional SNAs, show variabilities across different cultures. Reading direction is considered to be the main factor in explaining these differences. In line with this, individuals with right-to-left (RL) reading habits show a weaker or even reverse SNARC effect. In the present study, we investigated whether SNAs are influenced not only by reading direction, but also by cultural directional preferences such as drawing lines, arranging objects, imagining objects (i.e., rightward or leftward facing), or representing events in time (i.e., mentally representing the past/future on the left/right, respectively). To test this hypothesis, we measured the cultural directional preferences and the SNARC effect across three cultures in an online setup; German, Turkish, and Iranian. LR preferences in the Cultural Directional Preferences Questionnaire were most prominent in German participants, intermediate in Turkish participants, and least prominent in Iranian participants. In line with this, the LR SNARC effect was strongest in German, intermediate in Turkish, and weakest (but not RL) in Iranian culture. These findings suggest that cultural directional preferences are involved in the emergence of adult SNAs in addition to the reading direction.

How do group size changes influence cooperation within groups? To examine this question, we performed a dynamic, network-based prisoner’s dilemma experiment with fMRI. Across 83 human participants, we observed increased cooperation as group size increased. However, our computational modeling analysis of behavior and fMRI revealed that groups size itself did not increase cooperation. Rather, interaction between (1) participants’ stable prosocial tendencies, and (2) dynamic reciprocal strategy weighed by memory confidence, underlies the group size-modulated increase in cooperation because the balance between them shifts towards the prosocial tendency with higher memory demands in larger groups. We found that memory confidence was encoded in fusiform gyrus and precuneus, whereas its integration with prosocial tendencies was reflected in the left DLPFC and dACC. Therefore, interaction between recall uncertainty during reciprocal interaction (i.e., forgetting) and one’s individual prosocial preference is a core pillar of emergent cooperation in more naturalistic and dynamic group formation.
BackgroundThe caries severity in childhood may predict caries conditions in the future and even in adulthood in caries risk models. Nevertheless, the rate of recurrent caries after treatment of severe early childhood caries is high and correlated with behavioural factors, rather than clinical indicators. Compliance with the caries control programme has been demonstrated to prevent root caries development in head and neck cancer patients, suggesting that compliance with treatment protocols is a more important key to bringing about successful outcomes than treatment protocols themselves. However, only few studies defined the triggers of compliance in patients with long-term successful treatment outcomes, especially in children. Furthermore, driven forces of compliant behaviours from patients’ aspects have not been described in the dental literature before. Regarding the need to improve current caries control interventions for children, in this study, behavioural determinants that shaped compliance of resilient children were investigated with a qualitative study design, for its advantage in revealing what an individual really feels which incorporates their experience without restriction from previous literature. Resilience was defined as improvement in caries conditions between primary and mixed or permanent dentitions.MethodsInterviews were performed with the patient group, including eight resilient children (M/F = 5/3) and their ten caregivers (M/F = 2/8), and the dentist group, including ten paediatric dentists (M/F = 6/4; clinical experience mean = 26.9 years, minimum = 16 years). Thematic analysis was used to identify main themes.ResultsFour themes were identified: (1) dental things/teeth are their priority, (2) normalising, (3) tiger parenting/conscientiousness, and (4) trust. These determinants were identically described by both the patient and dentist groups. Dentists' suggestions were the priority, providing the norms in daily life of resilient patients and their caregivers. These patients found no excuses for failing to take dentists' advice, not only because they trusted their dentists, but also because they and their caregivers were conscientious about putting dentists' orders into practice.ConclusionsIt is implementing suggested oral health behaviours daily, but not merely agreeing with professional advice, that alters the fate of teeth in these resilient patients.
The purpose of this study is to investigate Generation Y’s intention to use metaverse Apps and devices in the context of the emerging markets. In doing so, by considering the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this research delves into the relationships between the intention to use metaverse apps and devices, the sense of presence, perceived attributes of ease of use, usefulness, enjoyment, and personal innovativeness. A self-administered survey questionnaire was designed to collect the data from Gen Y which yielded 205 valid responses. The research model was evaluated using two approaches: partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) as a symmetric approach, and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) as an asymmetric approach. The findings from PLS-SEM emphasize the positive effects of perceived enjoyment (PE), personal innovativeness in information technology (PIIT), perceived usefulness (PU), and perceived ease of use (PEU) on immersion and the sense of presence. Furthermore, it identified the mediating role of immersion and presence between PE, PIIT, PEU, PU, and intention to use metaverse apps and devices. The fsQCA analysis uncovers two distinct combinations of factors that elucidate high intention to use metaverse apps and devices. Among these, perceived enjoyment (PE) emerges as the most pivotal factor influencing heightened intention. This study is the first to explore Gen Y’s intention to adopt metaverse apps and devices. The findings from this study will provide useful insights to the metaverse companies and internet companies about how to encourage the young consumer to participate in metaverse world.
Robotaxi services (RTS) represent a transformative shared mobility solution empowered by autonomous driving technology. However, consumer ambivalence toward new technologies may hinder the widespread adoption of RTS. Few studies have examined in-depth consumers’ two-sided psychology in accepting RTS. Drawing on behavioral reasoning theory and technical readiness, this study examines the relative influence of reasons for and against RTS acceptance among Chinese consumers and the importance of each reason. Using questionnaire data from 450 Chinese consumers, a dual-stage analysis combining partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to validate causal hypotheses and determine the significance of factors. Dual-path analysis revealed a strong positive effect of “reasons for” and a slightly weaker negative effect of “reasons against” on consumers’ attitudes and intentions toward RTS acceptance. Among the “reasons for”, innovativeness was the most significant determinant of RTS acceptance, followed by perceived benefits, subjective norms, and optimism. Among the “reasons against”, insecurity emerged as the main psychological barrier to RTS acceptance, with discomfort also playing a significant role, whereas interaction barriers were found to be insignificant. This study emphasizes the importance of identifying both pro- and anti-adoption reasons in the mass marketing of RTS. These findings offer policymakers and industry stakeholders valuable insights to comprehensively assess consumer psychology and promote RTS adoption.
Background and objectivesDespite anecdotal evidence pointing to the high prevalence of job stress and burnout among dietitians and nutritionists, few studies have been conducted on this topic. Moreover, most studies are from Western countries. The objective of the current study, based on systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression, is aimed to provide systematically graded evidence to assess the prevalence of emotional burnout among dietitians and nutritionists across age, sex, and cultural backgrounds.MethodsTwo reviewers independently conducted a systematic search from 1 January 2000, to 1 April 2024 and was later updated to 15 November 2024, across seven databases: EBSCOhost Research Platform, EMBASE, PubMed/MEDLINE, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science. The DerSimonian-Laird method was utilized to pool the data in this meta-analysis. Data from a total of 12,166 dietitians and nutritionists were extracted from 16 datasets (published in twelve research reports) covering a period of approximately 25 years. We measured the pooled prevalence of global burnout syndrome and its individual symptoms among dietitians and nutritionists. Subgroup meta-analyses were also conducted to identify a comprehensive set of moderators, including participants’ age and sex.ResultsThe prevalence of global burnout syndrome in dietitians and nutritionists (K = 10,N= 10,081) showed an overall prevalence rate of 40.43% [23.69; 59.74], I² = 99.3%, τ [95% CI] = 1.18 [0.84; 1.97], τ² [95% CI] = 1.38 [0.71; 3.89], H [95% CI] = 12.68 [11.70; 13.74]. The prevalence of burnout dimensions/individual symptoms in dietitians and nutritionists (K = 2,N= 695) is summarized as follows: emotional exhaustion (EE) at 26.11% [15.14; 41.17], I² = 84.0%, τ = 0.21, τ² = 0.46, Q = 6.25,p< 0.001; depersonalization (DP) at 6.59% [1.08; 31.22], I² = 95.0%, τ = 1.72, τ² = 1.31, Q = 20.18,p< 0.001; and personal accomplishment (PA) at 59.29% [39.81; 76.23], I² = 89.3%, τ = 0.29, τ² = 0.54, Q = 9.36,p< 0.001. Meta-regression showed no difference by age or sex,p= 0.80, andp= 0.20, respectively.ConclusionThis meta-analysis revealed that the prevalence of burnout among dietitians and nutritionists is as high as in other medical professionals. Furthermore, age and sex were not significantly associated with emotional burnout among dietitians and nutritionists. This study provides the impetus for policy changes to improve dietitians’ and nutritionists’ working conditions, as well as the overall quality of nutrition care.
Lexical competition between newly acquired and already established representations of written words is considered a marker of word integration into the mental lexicon. To date, studies about the emergence of lexical competition involved mostly artificial training procedures based on overexposure and explicit instructions for memorization. Yet, in real life, novel word encounters occur mostly without explicit learning intent, through reading texts with words appearing rarely. This study examined the lexical integration of words learned through text reading. In Experiment1, two groups of participants read a short book with embedded novel words. Only one group was asked to memorize the unfamiliar words. In the semantic categorization task, we found evidence for lexical competition with slower responses to existing orthographic neighbors (e.g.,hublot) of the newly learned words (e.g.,hubbot) than to a set of matched items. This effect was found independently of the group 24 h after initial exposure. In addition, a facilitation pattern was observed immediately after the reading session. However, post hoc analyses suggested that the competition effect was mainly driven by the data from the group receiving explicit learning instructions. Experiment2aimed to replicate the findings obtained in the group without explicit learning instructions. The results revealed the same pattern, characterized by a facilitatory effect immediately after the reading session and an inhibitory effect 24 h after the exposure. Overall, these results showed that lexical competition emerged from a naturalistic reading after a delay, regardless of whether participants were asked to learn novel words or not.
Henriques has developed a unified, synthetic approach to the fragmentation in psychology that is meta-psychological, philosophical, meta-view in nature. This synthetic model includes concepts such as the tree of knowledge, justification system, behavioral investment, and the influence matrix. Further, Henriques developed a unified psychotherapy and related approach that included five character adaptation systems, the wheel of development, the nested model of well-being, and psychological mindfulness. He includes the concept of “mental behaviorism” as a bridge for the field. This article describes the Henriques model briefly. Young’s approach to unifying psychology and psychotherapy is elaborated greatly in this article. It works from the premise that all sub-disciplines in psychology focus on causality in one way or another, and that they can be characterized as having common causal elements. He developed an integrated lifespan developmental model based on his Neo-Piagetian and Neo-Eriksonian models, another unifying aspect of the model. The article greatly elaborates this unifying psychology model and, as well, presents new concepts related to it. The article asks and responds to the following questions: Is unifying psychology possible, or is the field too fragmented? Is causality a worthy axis on which to base the unification of psychology? Is it contradictory to attempt to unify psychology under the rubric of causality with disparate causal theories? Should grand theories in psychology’s past serve in unifying psychology? Should the unification of psychology include the unification of psychopathology? Can Young’s unified psychology model be applied beyond psychology? The approaches taken by Henriques and Young to unifying psychology are complementary as much as different.
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, students may experience severe learning loss. This study investigated the potential effects of family environment and teacher autonomy support on learning engagement among secondary school students during home-based online learning amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the underlying mechanisms, including the mediating roles of psychological distress and difficulties in learning motivation. The researchers recruited 2,470 secondary school students in Beijing to complete an online survey. The final sample for analysis included 1937 students with an average age of 15.16 years (SD= 1.67 years, range = 12.62–18.76 years). Several instruments were used, including the Home Environment Questionnaire for Secondary School Students, the Learning Climate Questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale, the Middle School Students Learning Motivation Test, and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale for Students. The results of structural equation modeling revealed the following findings: (1) both the family environment and teacher autonomy support significantly predicted students’ learning engagement; (2) difficulties in learning motivation mediated the relationship between the family environment and learning engagement as well as the relationship between teacher autonomy support and learning engagement; and (3) chain mediation effects were established, with psychological distress and difficulties in learning motivation mediated the association between the family environment and learning engagement as well as the association between teacher autonomy support and learning engagement. These findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of the family environment and teacher autonomy support on learning engagement, thus providing insights for promoting students’ learning engagement, especially during future crises or disasters.
In today's high-choice media environment, the relations between news consumption and (extreme) political views receive extensive attention. While social media and news aggregators are often blamed for political polarization, theories from media psychology highlight the importance of additional aspects of news consumption, aside from the media types used, in impacting the formation of political views and thereby, for instance, polarization. However, these aspects are typically studied in isolation, neglecting the heterogeneity in where and how news can be consumed. Based on this observation, the present work investigated the conjoint relations of various aspects of news consumption across media types with political views and their extremity. Study 1 included two samples ofN= 714 (sample 1) andN= 721 (sample 2) participants completing an online survey assessing political news consumption habits and general political views, namely, ideology and affective polarization. Study 2 included two samples ofN= 725 (sample 3) andN= 713 (sample 4) participants completing scales on issue-specific political views, namely, attitudes on war and the war against Ukraine. Latent Profile Analyses revealed four mostly media type-specific news consumer profiles replicated across samples, indicating that individuals choose one media type, like social media, aggregators, or print media, and devote considerable time to consuming political news from various sources, including attitude-incongruent news and diverse perspectives, from the same selected media type. While these profiles differed on sociodemographic and personality variables, few significant relations were found between these profiles and political views. These findings highlight the complexity of these relations and challenge the assumption that only certain media types, and news consumption via them, drive political extremity.
During emergencies like wartime, parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) face heightened challenges, potentially leading to Parental Burnout (PB). Wartime conditions can exacerbate children’s behavioral difficulties, contributing to PB. Protective factors such as successful Emotional Regulation (ER) and perceived social support may mitigate PB. This study aims to compare child behavioral problems, parental ER difficulties, perceived social support, stress, and PB between parents of children with ASD and Typical Development (TD) during wartime. It also investigates how ER difficulties, perceived social support, and stress moderate the relationship between child behavioral problems and PB. The study included 213 Israeli parents: 101 parents of children diagnosed with ASD and 112 parents of TD children. Participants were recruited during the “Swords of Iron” War using purposive sampling via online platforms. Findings indicate that children with ASD exhibited higher levels of behavioral problems, and their parents experienced increased difficulties in ER, stress, and PB, alongside decreased perceived social support compared to parents of TD children. Moderation analysis revealed that ER difficulties, perceived social support, and stress moderated the direct association between child behavioral problems and PB specifically among parents of TD children. This study underscores the heightened vulnerability of parents with ASD-diagnosed children during wartime, emphasizing the importance of understanding how these circumstances impact parental well-being and available resources. Effective interventions should target enhancing ER, social support, and addressing parental stress, PB, and child behavioral issues, underscoring the need for prioritized services despite wartime challenges.
BackgroundThe long-lasting consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological well-being of young people have become an emerging research topic, which still raises several questions for post-pandemic interventions at the individual and community levels. This research investigated the relationship between COVID-19 pandemic life events and the occurrence of binge eating behaviors in emerging adults, hypothesizing indirect effects of the emotional impact of pandemic events and social anxiety.MethodsData collection was conducted in November and December 2021 in Italy, involving 286 university students aged 18 to 30 years (Mage= 20.20;SDage= 2.43; 69.6% women) who completed an online anonymous survey. Participants reported the pandemic-related stressors experienced in the last year (i.e., adverse life events; the number of days in quarantine), the long-lasting emotional impact of these experiences in the previous week (i.e., intrusive thoughts; avoidance of thoughts), social anxiety symptoms, and frequency of binge eating episodes. A serial mediation model was tested in line with the research hypotheses.ResultsBoth the number of days in quarantine and the pandemic adverse life events in the last year were significantly and positively related to binge eating via the sequential indirect effects of (1) intrusive thoughts and (2) social anxiety.ConclusionOur findings provide support for the long-lasting effects of pandemic events and quarantine on emerging adults’ mental health, with cascade effects on intrusive symptoms, social anxiety, and binge eating. The study has interesting research, practice, and public health policies implications.
The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) is widely used as a self-reported measure of behavioral and psychological characteristics associated with overeating. The initial validation study by Varlamov et al. (2020) provided an incomplete psychometric characterization of the Russian version of the DEBQ. So, the aim of the study was to determine new psychometric properties used to describe the internal structure of the questionnaire and to assess the internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the scales, as well as their convergent validity. The sample included 530 students (mean age: 20.8 ± 3.5 years) who completed online the DEBQ and the Yale Food Addiction Scale. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the three-factor structure of the questionnaire and the bifactor nature of the emotional scale. Reliability assessment revealed that the test-retest reliability and internal consistency of the external scale were lower than those of the emotional and restrained scales. All types of analyses, including descriptive item statistics, found problem items on the external scale that were more likely to be due to cultural differences or sample characteristics. In addition, it was shown that consumption of unhealthy foods was associated with emotional eating and external eating behaviors. Thus, the study expanded knowledge of the psychometric properties of the Russian version of the DEBQ. The findings from the Russian studies characterizing individuals with external eating behaviors should be considered with caution.
ObjectiveNight eating syndrome (NES) is an eating disorder characterized by evening hyperphagia. Despite having a prevalence comparable to some other eating disorders, NES remains sparsely investigated and poorly characterized. The present study examined the phenotypic and genetic associations for NES in the clinical Mass General Brigham Biobank.MethodCases of NES were identified through relevant billing codes for eating disorders (F50.89/F50.9) and subsequent chart review; patients likely without NES were set as controls. Other diagnoses were determined from billing codes and collapsed into one of 1,857 distinct phenotypes based on clinical similarity. NES associations with diagnoses were systematically conducted in phenome-wide association scans using logistic regression models with adjustments for age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Polygenic scores for six related traits, namely for anorexia nervosa, depression, insomnia, sleep apnea, obesity, and type 2 diabetes were tested for associations with NES among participants of European ancestry using adjusted logistic regression models.ResultsPhenome-wide scans comparing patients with NES against controls (casesn= 88; controlsn= 64,539) identified associations with 159 clinical diagnoses spanning 13 broad disease groups including endocrine/metabolic and digestive diseases. Notable associations were evident for bariatric surgery, vitamin D deficiency, sleep disorders (sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The polygenic scores for insomnia and obesity were associated with higher odds of NES (insomnia: odds ratio [OR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07, 1.43; obesity: 1.98; 95% CI, 1.71, 2.28).DiscussionComplementary phenome-wide and genetic exploratory analyses provided information on unique and shared features of NES, offering insights that may facilitate its precise definition, diagnosis, and the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
Prior correlational studies have shown that belief in the biological theory of sexual orientation (BTSO) is associated with more positive attitudes toward homosexuality. However, individuals often interpret scientific evidence in ways that align with their pre-existing beliefs and motivations. This research experimentally investigated whether gender and religiosity moderate heterosexual individuals’ responses to scientific evidence either supporting or refuting BTSO. In two studies, heterosexual men (Study 1,N= 118) and both men and women (Study 2,N= 280) reported their religiosity and were exposed to evidence suggesting either biological differences or similarities between heterosexual and gay individuals. Results showed that, in the biological differences condition, heterosexual women and less religious men were more likely to perceive homosexuality as a natural biological variation and expressed more positive attitudes toward it. In contrast, more religious men interpreted the same evidence as indicating a biological anomaly in gay individuals and displayed more negative attitudes toward homosexuality.
Cyberbullying is a complex issue among youth, yet, while adolescent victimization is well-studied, little is known about what causes youth to perpetrate cyberbullying in Malaysia. This quantitative study examines the association of sociodemographic factors and the use of social media with cyberbullying experiences and practices among youth in Malaysia. A baseline survey, conducted from July to December 2023 as part of an intervention program, gathered data from 309 participants aged 18 to 30 via an online survey. Statistical analyses, including logistic regression, were conducted to determine the relationships between sociodemographic factors, social media use, and cyberbullying behaviors. Of the total participants, the mean age was 21 years, 201 (65%) were female, 241 (78%) were undergraduate students. Among them, 302 (97.7%) were aware of cyberbullying, 252 (81.5%) witnessed it, 179 (58%) experienced it, and 51 (17%) participated in it. Females had higher odds of experiencing cyberbullying than males (odds ratio (OR), 2.67; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.64–4.33), while males were more likely to engage in cyberbullying. Students and unemployed individuals had higher risks of experiencing cyberbullying. Heavy social media users (8 + hours/day) were at increased risk (OR, 16.2; 95% CI, 5.31–49.4), with Facebook use linked to higher cyberbullying exposure. There is a need for targeted interventions and policies to safeguard females and students to support their well-being. Limiting social media usage may serve as a preventive measure. Further longitudinal research to deepen understanding and collaboration among researchers, educators, and policymakers is crucial to creating safer digital environments for youth.
Involution has emerged as a significant and compelling topic in the field of education. However, the absence of a suitable measurement tool for assessing college teachers’ publishing involutional behaviors has been a major challenge. This research aims to address this gap by developing and validating the Academic Publishing Involution Scale for College Teachers in China (APISCTC), which features items specifically designed to capture publishing involutional behaviors and offer a more comprehensive understanding of its components. The study involved a sample of 642 college teachers from a northern province in China, and the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in the identification of three factors: Quantity-Oriented Publication Strategies, External Resource Quality Enhancement, and Collaboration Avoidance Orientation, all of which demonstrated strong psychometric properties. The significant correlations between APISCTC as well as its three factors and publishing pressure further supported the criterion-related validity of the APISCTC. Consequently, the APISCTC can serve as both an assessment tool for college teachers to evaluate their publishing involutional behaviors and a research instrument for exploring the relationships between involutional behaviors and publishing pressure.
PurposeAutistic youth are at heightened risk of mental health issues and face several barriers to accessing appropriate supports. A lack of available services is a common barrier that many autistic youth experience, with only 43% of autistic youth from the US who needed mental health services receiving them. Little is known about the availability of these mental health services in Canada, despite the high prevalence of mental health issues in autistic youth. The current study is one of very few that has reviewed the state of community-based programs and services for the support of mental health challenges in autistic people in North America, and the first such study in Canada.MethodsUsing an environmental scan methodology, we conducted a search of resource listings on various community websites with a filter for “autism”. The resulting websites were then reviewed to find what services providers offer for autistic youth (≥25 years) and contacted to complete a survey.Results267 listings of mental health supports were identified in the initial search, with 94 sites that specifically mentioned serving autistic youth. 43% (n= 40) of service providers completed a survey about the services they offered, therapeutic approaches, and background training. Providers reported that neurodiversity approaches and multi-disciplinary teams were working well in their practices, yet funding access and society’s views on autism were barriers they face.ConclusionFindings add to the growing body of evidence that availability of services is a systemic barrier that many autistic youth experience when accessing mental health supports.
Searching for a unique target is faster when its unique feature repeats than when it changes. The standard account for this priming-of-popout (PoP) phenomenon is that selecting a target increases the attentional priority of its features in subsequent searches. However, empirical tests of this priority account have yielded contradictory findings. Here, we attempted to clarify why support of its predictions has been elusive in spatial-cueing studies. We noted that the repetition manipulation is stronger in PoP studies than in spatial-cueing studies: The target and nontarget features either repeat or swap in the former, whereas in the latter, the target color either repeats or changes while the nontarget color remains constant. Here, we implemented the stronger repetition manipulation in the spatial-cueing paradigm. If PoP affects attentional priority, the cue-validity effect should be larger when the current-cue color and previous-target color match than when they mismatch. The results of Experiment1revealed the opposite effect. Moreover, they showed that well-replicated contingent-capture effects do not hold when target and nontarget colors are allowed to swap—an observation that was confirmed in Experiment2. In Experiment3, we verified that with our experimental set-up, a subtle manipulation of attentional priority could modulate cue-validity effects. While the present study does not resolve why evidence for the priority account is inconsistent with the spatial-cueing paradigm, they eliminate one possible reason for such inconsistency. They also reveal that allowing the target and distractors color to swap masks contingent-capture effects, thereby highlighting the complexity of spatial-cueing effects.
This study aimed to validate the Mandarin translation of the Stanford Social Dimensions Scale (SSDS). The initial validation sample consisted of 480 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Mage= 9.35). Discriminant validity was appraised by comparing relevant SSDS scores among samples of children with ASD, typical development (TD) (N= 160,Mage= 7.16), and non-ASD but Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs) (N= 170,Mage= 5.08). Confirmatory application of the Exploratory Structural Equation Modelling indicated that a five-factor model encompassing Social Motivation (SM), Social Affiliation (SA), Expressive Social Communication (ESC), Social Recognition (SR) and Unusual Approach (UA) provided adequate to excellent fit to the data in ASD group ([CFI] = .908, [TLI] = .930, [RMSEA] = .052, [SRMR] = .028). The factor loadings of most items constituting SM, SA, ESC, and SR factors were aligned with the original factor structure in the US sample, except items on the UA factor that showed lower loadings. The internal consistency was .93-.96, and test–retest reliability was .86. Discriminate validity was excellent, with the ASD group showing significantly lower scores compared to non-ASD NDDs and TD groups. Convergent and divergent validity of the SSDS was strong, as indexed by the pattern of correlations with relevant Social Responsiveness Scale, second edition (SRS-2), and Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) domains. This study provided preliminary validation of the Mandarin translation of the SSDS by largely replicating the original factor structure and showing evidence for strong discriminant, convergent, and divergent validity. Potential areas where further refinement and potential expansion of the SSDS are needed were identified.

BackgroundChronic diseases pose significant threats to persons’ well-being and mental health leading to stress, anxiety and depression without effective resilience strategies. However, experiences to gain resilience in living with chronic disease in the context of Asian countries remain insufficiently explored. This review seeks to provide a comprehensive summary of qualitative evidence that explores the lived experience that cultivates resilience in chronic diseases among adults within Asian countries.MethodsA comprehensive review of five databases - Web of Sciences, Ebsco (Medline), PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus was carried out, following the Joanna Brings Institute (JBI) standards and employing PRISMA Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) reporting guideline. The review encompassed studies published in English from January 2013 to December 2023. Four reviewers assessed the literature’s eligibility and extracted relevant lived experiences to address the research question based on prior studies. Subsequently, a content analysis was performed.ResultsOf the 3651 articles screened, 12 were included in this review. Three key themes emerged: (1) Sociocultural norms shaped resilience, delved into the culturally-mediated childhood development, traditional cultural beliefs, social relationships and supports and spirituality (2) Positive emotions nurtured resilience highlighted optimistic about becoming healthy, self-efficacy in self-care, endurance during hardship, self-reflection on health, acceptance of having disease, and appreciation of life while (3) Problem-solving strategies fostered resilience underlined improve disease literacy, ability to deal with disease challenges and engage in meaningful activities.ConclusionOur review addresses important research gaps on sociocultural norms that shaped resilience in chronic disease despite a small number of research. Therefore, this warrants further studies on how the traditional cultures and beliefs influence resilience among the Asian population living with chronic disease. Further research should thoroughly describe the qualitative methodologies and theoretical framework to provide more comprehensive information on the experience of resilience in chronic disease.
Black Americans are underrepresented in research studies about well-being. This underrepresentation can perpetuate and exacerbate health inequities. We used focus groups to explore the perceptions of Black American community members regarding definitions of well-being and facilitators and barriers to well-being. Eight focus groups were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Four focus groups comprised of 26 participants produced valid and interpretable data. Transcripts were analyzed, and the findings were grouped into three themes: (a) describing and defining feeling good or well-being, (b) expanding on key dimensions of feeling good or well-being, and (c) capturing systemic and community-level barriers and resources that impact participant well-being. The study results revealed that Black American participants were actively engaged in defining, protecting, and promoting their well-being, as well as the well-being of their families and communities. Specifically, participants identified individual, family, and community as protective factors against negative physical and mental health experiences. Implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers are provided.
Purpose: The use of Augmented Reality (AR) in the field of neurodevelopmental communication disability is emergent and under-researched. The views of supporters on the use of AR by children with neurodevelopmental communication disability will help in the design of applications suited to their educational, learning, social, and communication needs. Aims: To determine the views of supporters of children with neurodevelopmental communication disability on the use of AR, and facilitators or barriers to its use. Methods: We conducted an online survey on the use of AR including categorical and open-ended questions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Results: In total, 17 health professionals, 12 educators, and 7 parents completed the survey. Participants across groups viewed AR as a potentially helpful technology if sufficient training and technical support were provided. They also considered that financial costs and lack of knowledge could limit AR implementation. Conclusions: Supporters of children with developmental communication disability view that AR may be a useful and motivational tool if it is affordable and implemented with training and technical support. Future research should gather the views of children on and experience with AR to further the co-design of AR applications.
PurposeThe aim of the current study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Emotion Regulation and Social Skills Questionnaire (ERSSQ) among young Farsi-speaking individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Iran.MethodsThis cross-sectional study analyzed data from 108 children and teenagers (aged 7 to 14 years; mean age = 10.55 years, 91% male) with ASD, along with an equal number of neurotypical children, their families, and teachers. The assessment of the ERSSQ’s psychometric properties included evaluations of reliability, content validity, and face validity. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used to estimate the reliability of the ERSSQ-P and ERSSQ-T which were completed respectively by parents and teachers of children with autism spectrum disorders.ResultsThe results indicated that the Persian versions of the ERSSQ-P and ERSSQ-T questionnaires exhibited adequate face and content validity (CVI = 0.92 and 0.88, respectively). Additionally, both ERSSQ-P and ERSSQ-T demonstrated acceptable internal consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha values of 0.95 and 0.70, respectively.DiscussionThis study confirms the effectiveness and validity of the ERSSQ-P and ERSSQ-T, which can be utilized by specialists in the field of autism for clinical and research applications. These instruments offer a straightforward and cost-effective means of assessing emotion regulation and social skills among Farsi-speaking children and adolescents with ASD.
Developmental research has mostly focused on negative body image, somewhat neglecting the role positive body image plays in adolescent development. To fill this gap, the present longitudinal study investigated the directionality of effects among positive body image, identity, and eating disorder symptoms across one year. Two waves of data were collected from a sample of 915 high school students in Flanders (T1: 60% female;Mage= 16.17;SD= 1.28; range 14–19). First, a novel, four-factor scale of adolescent positive body image was confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis. Second, cross-lagged models revealed body self-appreciation to be a crucial factor of positive body image, which positively predicted identity synthesis and negatively predicted identity confusion and eating disorder symptoms over time. Contrary to expectations, resilience against media body ideals was predicted by maladaptive identity dimensions. The study highlights the importance of positive body image, advancing knowledge about its associations with developmental challenges of identity formation and with eating disorder symptoms faced by adolescents.
Although organisations can effectively resist risks and enhance organisational performance by creating a Perception of Psychological Safety (PPS) climate, there is a lack of PPS scales developed under a multidimensional integrated interaction perspective. Based on a review of relevant theories, this paper clearly defines the concept of PPS and proposes a three-dimensional model of PPS, including organisational- level PPS, team- level PPS, and dyadic- level PPS. In this paper, we develop and validate a scale for measuring PPS in the workplace using 12 startups in a relatively economically developed region in the southeastern coastal region of China as the empirical target. The results of the empirical analyses show that the scale we developed has a good level of reliability and consistency, as well as good content validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity.
This article delves into the psychological framework of Busemann, focusing on the core principles of balance, character, autonomy and dialogue. It emphasizes how these concepts contribute to the development of personality, the dynamic process of becoming a fully realized individual. According to Busemann, personality evolves through the interaction of personal dispositions, talents, and character, with dialogue playing a crucial role in fostering growth. The paper also examines the phenomenon ofGeborgenheit, understood as a sense of security and inner stability, within this theoretical context.Geborgenheitis framed as an advanced psychological need that emerges once basic needs are satisfied and is deeply tied to both external and internal balance. By analyzing the character of Holden Caulfield in J.D. Salinger’sThe Catcher in the Rye, the article illustrates the challenges of achievingGeborgenheitand suggests practical implications for applying Busemann’s theory to create supportive environments in educational settings.
This commentary outlines a novel agenda for future mindfulness research, building on various authors’ insights, particularly Indius (Indius, S. (2024). Meditation and Self-transcendence: A Human need?Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science,58(3), 878–883), who integrates Maslow’s hierarchy of needs into the discussion of mindfulness. Indius argues for a revision of humanistic psychology to reflect contemporary needs, emphasizing the dynamic nature of meditation as a transformative process that leads to self-actualization and self-transcendence. This exploration highlights the metaphor of a volcanic eruption to illustrate how meditation can lead to the destruction and subsequent rebirth of psychological needs, fostering a deeper connection to oneself and the environment. Additionally, it examines the interplay of social, material, and cultural contexts in shaping mindfulness practices, suggesting a need for personalization and ecological interconnectedness. The commentary aligns with multiple perspectives presented in the Special Issue, underscoring the necessity of adapting traditional frameworks like Maslow’s to meet evolving cultural and psychological landscapes. Future research pathways include preserving mindfulness breakthroughs, exploring religious worldviews, and integrating social environments into mindfulness studies, ultimately advocating for a holistic understanding of mindfulness as both a process and outcome in the context of human experience.
BackgroundSupportive relationships provide positive affect and a sense of belonging, which enable positive mental health outcomes.ObjectiveThis study examines the association between the quality of the relationship of youth in Residential Care (RC) with their best friend and their mental health, considering the moderator role of gender and age and the context of friendship (in/outside RC) in these associations.MethodParticipants were 752 youth (46.4% girls), aged 11–25 years (M= 16.19,SD= 2.25), and their main caregiver. Youth filled out the Network of Relationships Inventory to evaluate their relationship quality with their best friend through six conceptually distinct, though interrelated, dimensions (companionship, intimate self-disclosure, emotional support, satisfaction, conflict and criticism), while their main residential caregiver completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (internalizing and externalizing problems).ResultsYounger youth with higher levels of perceived emotional support have fewer internalizing problems, compared to older youth. Boys with higher perceived companionship are described as having lower levels of internalizing problems compared to girls. Girls with higher perceived intimate disclosure are described as having lower levels of internalizing problems, compared to boys. And girls with higher perceived conflict are described as having higher levels of externalizing problems, compared to boys.ConclusionsThe findings add to existing evidence on the association between quality friendship relationships and youth’s mental health, by highlighting the moderating role of youth’s age and gender in that associations.
BackgroundVarious factors associated with attitudes toward the utilization of professional psychological help among the school-going population have been explored, but studies from Arabian Gulf countries are lacking. This study aimed to assess attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help, examine how demographic factors and self-esteem are associated with seeking psychological help, and understand the interaction between these variables.MethodsA cross-sectional correlational design was used. A random sample of Omani secondary school students (n= 2165) aged 15–18 years completed the demographics sheet, the Scale of Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help (SATSPH), and the Rosenberg self-esteem scale. Hierarchical regression analysis with interaction was performed to test the moderating role of self-esteem in the relationship between selected demographics and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help (ATSPH).ResultsMost of the adolescents exhibited poor attitudes toward ATSPH. The findings demonstrated a significant moderating effect of self-esteem on the relationship between demographics (sex and age) and ATSPH (ΔR 2 = 0.002, F (7, 2156) = 4.839,p< 0.001). In terms of sex, women may have more positive attitudes toward seeking help than men. However, when self-esteem is considered, the positive effect of being female can reverse at higher levels of self-esteem, suggesting that men with higher self-esteem may have more positive attitudes toward seeking help than women with higher self-esteem. Furthermore, initially, age was not significant. However, when self-esteem was introduced as a moderator, age was a significant predictor. These findings indicate that the effect of age on seeking professional psychological help is influenced by self-esteem.ConclusionsThis study highlights that attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help among Omani adolescents are generally poor and are influenced by both demographic factors and self-esteem. Although women tend to have more positive attitudes than men do, this can change with varying levels of self-esteem. Similarly, the effect of age on these attitudes is dependent on self-esteem levels. This underscores the complex interplay between demographic factors and self-esteem in shaping attitudes toward psychological help-seeking behaviors. Therefore, more studies of this nature are warranted.
The willingness to apologize and forgive is robustly associated with relational and personal wellbeing, and thus, it may be worthwhile for children to be taught about the importance of apologies and forgiveness through apology prompting from their parents. However, there is limited research on parental apology prompting, as well as on parental attitudes on the developmental importance of child apologies. Guided by Family System Theory, we investigated whether the proclivity to apologize to and forgive a romantic partner is associated with positive parental attitudes on apologies and parental apology prompting. We also examined the role of childhood experiences with apologies, and moderators of these associations. We recruited a sample of parents of 3–10-year-olds. Parents’ proclivity to apologize to their romantic partner and their childhood experiences with apologies were positively associated with positive parental attitudes on apologies and parental apology prompting. The association between the proclivity to apologize to the romantic partner and parental apology prompting was mediated by positive parental attitudes on the developmental importance of child apologies. The proclivity to retaliate against the romantic partner was negatively associated with positive parental attitudes on apologies and parental apology prompting. Political conservatism and romantic relationship satisfaction moderated the association between the proclivity to apologize to the romantic partner and parental apology prompting. Further, we share measures of childhood experiences with apologies and parental attitudes on apologies that may be useful for future research. Results suggest that it may be advantageous for parent couples to prompt apologies from their children.
BackgroundThere is a lack of self-report measures specifically designed for Adjustment disorder. One of the most widely used instruments is the Adjustment Disorder New Module (ADNM), which has already been validated in different countries. The aim of this study was to validate the Spanish version of the ADNM-20 with a non-clinical sample, including a comparison with a high-risk sample.Method203 participants of the general population (mean age = 33.84) completed an online survey which included the Spanish version of the ADNM, the anxiety and depression measures GAD-7 and PHQ-9, and an assesment of coping strategies using the Brief-COPE.ResultsThe analysis of the scale’s internal structure revealed that a hierarchical model could best fit the data, as well as a bifactorial structure. The scale showed high internal consistency and an adequate differential validity, as differences were observed when comparing the high-risk and non-clinical groups. Positive correlations were also identified between ADNM and depression and anxiety, as well as different correlations with coping strategies.ConclusionThis study presents the first validation of the ADNM-20 in Spanish showing good reliability and validity results. In addition, a comparison with a high-risk sample and norms are offered to help future evaluators.
This study explored parents’/carers’ knowledge, interest, and preferences towards technology devices as support mediums for autistic children, the reasoning behind any choice and the factors associated with the most preferred technology device. Technology devices were conceptualised as smartphones, iPods, tablets, virtual reality, robots, and ‘other’ for participants to list their own further interpretations of technology devices. Survey data were collected from 267 parents/carers of autistic children aged 2–18 years internationally between May to October 2020. Parents/carers of autistic children and young people were aware of, interested in and mostly preferred the use of tablets because of their convenience and ease of use. They least preferred virtual reality followed by robots due to both being overwhelming, cold, inconvenient to transport and expensive. Robots, in particular, were unknown to respondents. The data suggested that some technology devices as a support medium are not widely known to families of autistic children and young people in support programmes. Technology devices need to be financially approachable and achieve a high standard of design to engage users. Future research should focus on gathering evidence from the autistic community about their preferences and views of technology devices as a medium in autism support programmes.
Use of highly visual social media has been shown to be detrimental to body image when containing idealized and unrealistic images, such as “fitspiration” content portraying thin and toned bodies. More recently, social media content that is labelled “body positive” portrays more diverse body shapes and preaches body acceptance and has been shown to improve women’s body image. To date, little is known about the comparative effects of this content on body image when delivered in written versus image form, or how body positive content may influence body image in men. The present study examined the relative effects of body positive and fitspiration quotes and images on body image among women and men, with images selected to target the respective beauty ideals ascribed to women (e.g., thin, toned, small bodies) and men (e.g., hypermuscular bodies). A total of 509 women and 489 men, aged 18–25, were recruited for an online study where they viewed one of five sets of images that targeted the respective beauty ideals for their gender: (1) fitspiration images, (2) fitspiration quotes, (3) body positive images, (4) body positive quotes, or (5) travel images; and completed pre- and post-exposure measures of state appearance satisfaction, body appreciation, appearance comparison, and appearance aspirations. Findings revealed more negative effects of fitspiration images on appearance satisfaction and body appreciation compared to all other conditions, which was true for both women and men. Further, appearance comparison did not emerge as a mediator of these effects, but partial support emerged for the role of appearance aspirations. Discussion centers on the potentially stronger effects of body positive images compared to written content and potential reasons why this was the case for both women and men. The need for more research on the promotion of positive body image in men is considered.
ObjectivesThis single-site, randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the impact of 8-week mindfulness sessions on cognitive variables such as working memory and sustained attention, along with emotional variables including stress and self-esteem, as well as social behavior, among adolescents aged 16 with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs).MethodsA total of 45 adolescents (24 boys; 21 girls; age, 16.02 ± 0.36 years) were enrolled and randomly assigned to three groups of 15, the mindfulness (MG), physical activity (PAG), and control group (CG), and blindly administered (a) the digit span task, (b) the Corsi Block-Tapping Test, (c) the Zazzo Two-Sign Barrage, (d) pH indicator paper strips, (e) the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and (f) the Social Responsiveness Scale at the baseline (T0) and after 8 weeks (T1). During the intervention period, the MG and PAG attended two weekly mindfulness and physical activity (PA) sessions of 30 and 45 min, respectively. At T0, no significant differences between the groups were observed.ResultsA two-way ANOVA with repeated measures revealed that mindfulness was associated with higher levels of (i) sustained attention, (ii) visuospatial working memory, (iii) stress, and (iv) social behavior. However, no significant effect was observed on verbal working memory and global self-esteem, in comparison to PAG and the CG.ConclusionsThe promising results of this study showed the potential of mindfulness practice as an effective and cost-effective intervention for a population with IDD. In this regard, mindfulness seems an interesting intervention to introduce into the school environment.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.
The agreement between parents’ and children’s reports of children’s mental health problems has generally been reported to be low to medium. The aim of this study was to examine the patterns of agreement between parents’ and children’s reports of risk for psychopathology in children in a community sample of Croatian 5th through 8th graders and their parents. A total of 250 parent–child dyads participated in the study. Parents completed the Psychiatric Symptoms Checklist (PSC-35) to report their children’s symptoms and the Parental Stress Inventory and Mental Health Inventory (MHI-38) to assess their own stress and mental health. The children completed a youth self-reported form of the PSC-35. The agreement between parents’ and children’s reports of risk for psychopathology was modest, and patterns of agreement showed that 70.8% of parents and children agreed that children did not have clinically significant levels of symptoms. 12% of parents reported that their children had a clinically significant risk, while their children did not, and in 13.2% of the parent–child dyads, only children reported having a clinically significant risk. Only 10% of parents and children agreed that children were at a significant risk for psychopathology. Furthermore, parents in the “parent only” group reported more parental stress, depression, loss of behavioral/emotional control, overall psychological distress and poorer overall mental health than did parents in the “child only” and “neither” groups. The results of the study emphasize the importance of including both parents’ and children’s reports in screening for risk for psychopathology, as well as taking into account parents’ emotional problems.
Therapists are essential in providing videoconferencing therapy (VCT), a crucial solution to the shortage of child psychological services. Understanding the barriers to adoption for providers can help increase access to treatment for children and families. The objectives are as follows: to understand (1) child therapists’ attitudes towards VCT compared to face-to-face (FF) services, (2) how the pandemic affected child therapists’ perceptions and usage of VCT, and (3) how child therapists’ perceptions of therapeutic rapport and patient engagement relate to perceived no-show rates. In this retrospective, cross-sectional study, 181 therapists completed a web-based training survey. VCT was rated better than FF by 19% of participants and about the same as FF by 25%. The majority of participants were either “extremely satisfied” (48%) or “somewhat satisfied” (41%) with VCT. Participants retrospectively rated their perceived usefulness of VCT before the pandemic (M= 2.95) significantly higher (p< .001) than their perceived usefulness of VCT during the pandemic (M= 4.31). After completing the training survey, participants were willing to devote 53.73% of clinical time to seeing patients via VCT (compared to FF). Perceived therapeutic rapport (p< .05, OR = 1.61) and patient engagement (p< .01, OR = 2.09) were independent predictors of perceived VCT no-show rates for children. Nearly half of child therapists either prefer VCT or consider it equivalent to FF services. Furthermore, child therapists have moderate to high satisfaction with VCT and plan to continue using it for over 50% of their clinical services. This study highlights that VCT is likely to remain a permanent modality in child psychological services.

What does the brain mean in a legal domain, and how does integrating neuroscience and law go beyond the practical difficulties highlighted by social scientists and legal theorists? The debate about the confluence of neuroscience and law is both promising and uncertain. Legal theorists took it as a conceptual error, and neuroscience advocates find it a promising emerging field. The social psychological approach towards law is for critical integration of both. Scholars took an alternative route, considering it a fascinating element of scientific discourse. The present article aims to show that the coming of “brain language” in the everyday legal discourse will not become a reality, as truth is inferred through everyday experiences and the interpretations of scientific knowledge. Scientific knowledge through mapping active brain areas by the available brain visualizing techniques shows the correlation between the brain and behavior, not the causation. So, its use in the legal domain seems less institutionalized, showing the determinism of the brain as less authentic in itself when compared with the intuitive path embedded in culture and history. Implication for sociolegal psychology working for dignity and social justice is discussed.
Ambivalent homoprejudice theory posits that homoprejudice manifests as hostile and benevolent beliefs that negatively impact LGBTQIA + -identifying individuals. Extensive research has been conducted on the adverse impact of homoprejudice on gay men, both in general and in workplace contexts. However, there has been minimal research on how ambivalent homoprejudice affects lesbian women in the workplace. A significant challenge in this line of research is the absence of a validated scale to measure ambivalent homoprejudice attitudes towards lesbian women. Therefore, in this series of two studies, we developed and provided psychometric support for the Ambivalent Homoprejudice Toward Lesbian Women at Work Scale (AHW-L). Study 1 (N= 266) established the dimensionality of the scale and provided initial evidence of both reliability and validity. Study 2 was conducted to confirm the structure found in Study 1 in a new sample (N= 204) and provided further evidence of reliability and validity. The final validated scale can be used by organizations to identify prejudice in their organization and support the development of targeted interventions. The aim of this scale is to promote and facilitate rigorous research on the workplace experiences of lesbian women.
Japan is experiencing an increase in the number of child abuse cases by mothers. To effectively address this issue, it is essential to understand the psychological and emotional landscape of Japanese mothers. This study explores the structure of victim cognition that Japanese mothers experience regarding their children and child-rearing, and how such victim cognition may predict inappropriate child-rearing behaviors. The study was conducted with 258 Japanese mothers raising at least one infant. We developed three explicit measures of victim cognition (damage interpretation, threat to demerit, and identity loss) and one implicit measure (a harm-be-harmed implicit association test). Mothers’ inappropriate child-rearing behaviors were also assessed using a questionnaire. Covariance structure analysis was then conducted to reveal how these explicit and implicit victim cognitions affect their negative feelings and inappropriate child-rearing behaviors. The analysis yielded three key findings. First, identity loss directly facilitated indulgence, while damage interpretation and threat to demerit directly facilitated physical violence, neglect, and mental harassment. Second, identity loss and damage interpretation indirectly inhibited physical violence, mediated by empty feelings. Third, in the harm-be harmed implicit association test, the stronger the implicit association between self and be harmed, the more physical violence and mental harassment promoted (χ2(18) = 15.44,p= .63, GFI = .986, AGFI = .966, CFI = 1.000, RMSEA = .000).
The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (n.d.) suggests that acquisition and use of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is dynamic and that learning multiple modalities may be beneficial particularly for those individuals with severe disabilities. Evaluation of response variability after training multiple modalities has yet to be explored. One advantage of learning multiple modalities manifests when an individual encounters communication breakdowns. Researchers replicated the procedures of Adami et al. (Behav Anal Pract 10:209-213, 2017) using a B-A-B-A design to determine the impact of lag schedules of reinforcement on response variability and persistence after participants learned two modalities simultaneously. Results demonstrated all three participants interchanged modalities and responding persisted when faced with a challenge to treatment in the form of a lag schedule. The Lag 1 schedule yielded higher variation of responding in comparison to the Lag 0 conditions. The current study extends response variability literature and preliminarily suggests that adding contrived communication breakdowns into AAC training may strengthen an individual’s multimodal communication repertoire.
This article, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie (ZPS), analyses the first twelve months of the psychotherapeutic treatment of a highly impaired 75-year-old woman troubled with multimorbidity (depression; PTSD; personality disorder). A new psychodramatic approach in monodrama, comprising the consequent integration of current phenomenological assumptions is demonstrated.
Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) describes different ways to communicate that supplement or compensate for the impairment of individuals with complex communication needs. AAC can utilize computerized devices, with visual scene display (VSD) or video visual scene display (VVSD) as a communication mode. Recent literature insufficiently tackles the differences between the two modes of presentation. To address this issue, we developed a user-friendly application that can display both video clips and photographs with embedded hotspots. The efficiency of VSD vs. VVSD was evaluated by measuring the perceptions and the performance of adults with ASD during conversation. Findings showed that VVSD has advantages over VSD in improving communication. However, further research with a larger sample size is required.
ObjectivesSelf-compassion involves being caring and kind to oneself rather than self-judging during setbacks or in the face of shortcomings. Reflective writing through journaling is a simple intervention strategy that may promote self-compassion. However, the majority of reflective writing studies have examined relatively transient changes in self-compassion after a single writing induction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and participants’ perceptions of using a 91-day self-compassion journal.MethodThis study used a 2 (condition: journal versus waitlist control) by 4 (time: baseline, Day 21, 56, 91) within-between randomized control design with mixed methods. The four time points aligned with the three sub-sections of the journal. Online self-report questionnaires were used to measure self-compassion (i.e., self-kindness, mindfulness, over-identification, self-judgement, common humanity, and isolation) and psychological well-being (i.e., autonomy, personal growth, self-acceptance). Changes in self-compassion and perceptions of the journal were also explored using open-ended questions.ResultsThis study included 66 participants (72.3% White; 97% women;meanage = 28.00,SD= 7.72). There were significant group-by-time interactions for overall self-compassion (p< 0.001) and well-being (p= 0.015) in favor of the self-compassion journal group. Most participants in the journal group expressed positive feedback about the journal and noted its beneficial impact on their self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness.ConclusionsThe findings suggest a 91-day journal may improve self-compassion and well-being. Journaling may be one low-cost and accessible way to promote self-compassion. Future studies should examine whether improvements in self-compassion persist after completing the journal.PreregistrationThis study was not preregistered.
BackgroundPostgraduate studies often entail significant stress, which can profoundly affect students’ well-being and academic performance. The supervisor-postgraduate relationship plays a pivotal role in shaping stress levels among postgraduate students. This study investigates the mediating role of self-efficacy and the moderating influence of psychological resilience in the link between supervisor-postgraduate relationships and perceived stress in postgraduate students.MethodsThis study employed a cross-sectional research design, conducting a survey among 609 postgraduate students selected through random sampling. The participants, aged between 20 and 53 years (M= 25.14,SD= 3.63), included 265 males and 344 females from various academic stages. Data were collected using validated scales to measure the supervisor-postgraduate relationship, perceived stress, self-efficacy, and psychological resilience. The moderated mediation model analysis was conducted to examine the hypothesized relationships and effects, utilizing SPSS with Hayes’ PROCESS macro to validate the statistical interactions.ResultsThe results indicated a significant negative association between the supervisor-postgraduate relationship and perceived stress (β=–0.27,p< 0.01), with self-efficacy partially mediating this relationship (β=–0.14,p< 0.01). Additionally, psychological resilience moderated both the direct effect of the supervisor-postgraduate relationship on perceived stress and the indirect effect via self-efficacy (interaction effectβ=–0.10,p< 0.01). These findings underscore the roles of self-efficacy and psychological resilience in reducing stress among postgraduate students, highlighting the importance of supportive supervisory relationships.ConclusionsThese findings underscore the critical importance of supportive supervisor-postgraduate relationships and highlight the roles of self-efficacy and resilience in alleviating stress among postgraduate students. This study offers valuable insights for cultivating positive supervisor-postgraduate relationships and enhancing well-being within postgraduate education.
This study explored the profiles of 175 teachers’ self-efficacy (TSE) in elementary, vocational, and higher physical education (PE) and examined teachers’ perceptions of inter-student bullying as outcomes of these profiles. The links between teachers’ perceptions of inter-student bullying and teaching level, teaching experience, tertiary education, gender, and age covariates were also analysed. The Latent cluster analysis (LCA), based on cross-sectional data collected via an anonymous online survey, revealed three profiles (low, intermediate, and high). Physical education teachers with low teaching-efficacy profiles reported more frequent inter-student bullying in PE than teachers with intermediate and high profiles. Regarding the low teaching-efficacy profile, tertiary education emerged as a significant covariate for bullying indicating that PE teachers with Master in Sport Science degree scored higher frequency in inter-student bullying than teachers with other degrees. In the intermediate profile, younger and more experienced PE teachers reported more frequent inter-student bullying than older and less experienced counterparts of the same cluster. Organisations responsible for teachers’ education and voluntary professional development must consider the diversity of TSE, regarding teachers’ age, teaching experience, and educational level, by tailoring pedagogical practices to promote bully-free PE for students.
A decrease in the rate of reinforcement associated with one component of a multiple schedule is typically associated with a decrease in responding in that component as well as with an increase in responding in the unchanged component. This increase in responding, referred to as positive contrast, is thought to result from an increase in the subjective value associated with the unchanged component. WilliamsAnimal Learning & Behavior, 19,337–344, (1991) challenged this hypothesis in an experiment with pigeons in which Stimulus A, associated with a variable interval schedule, was always followed by Stimulus X, associated with extinction, while Stimulus B, associated with the same variable interval schedule, was always followed by Stimulus Y, also associated with a variable interval schedule. Although Williams found that most of the pigeons pecked more at Stimulus A than at Stimulus B (behavioral contrast), when the pigeons were given a choice between Stimulus A and B, they showed a preference for Stimulus B. In the present experiment (a slight modification from Williams’s), we confirmed this finding. Although our pigeons pecked more at Stimulus A than at Stimulus B, they generally preferred Stimulus B, the stimulus that was not followed by extinction. This result suggests that positive contrast may not result from an increase in the subjective value of the unchanged component. Instead, it suggests that this version of positive contrast may result at least in part from the pigeons’ attempt to get all of the reinforcers possible in the presence of Stimulus A before the extinction schedule begins.
Background: Experts have recently integrated body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) into the DSM, which is characterized by an exaggerated concern over imagined or slight defect in the physical appearance of a body part(s). Individuals spend much time camouflaging and impairing their social, occupational, and interpersonal functions. Aim: This study delves into the interplay between body dysmorphic disorder, the feast of perfectionism, and their mediation by body image and narcissism among the Chinese student population. Methods: A cross-sectional research design was used on a sample of 270, consisting (72.59% female and 27.40% male) students of Shaanxi Normal University, China, who were selected on the random sampling technique and measured through Chinese versions of questionnaires, Body dysmorphic disorder, Body image, multidimensional perfectionism, and narcissism. We used R-programming and SPSS to explore the association among study variables. Results: Results unveiled a negative association between body dysmorphic disorder, adaptive perfectionism, and narcissism, while maladaptive perfectionism and body image correlated positively with BDD. The gender differences were notable in age, narcissism, BMI, adaptive perfectionism, and maladaptive perfectionism. Interestingly, overweight students displayed a higher BDD risk than those underweight students. The path analysis revealed that maladaptive perfectionism significantly predicted BDD, directly and indirectly, through BI (p< .001). However, the unexpected results of direct prediction of BDD by adaptive perfectionism were not observed, contrary to indirect predictions via body image and narcissism in Chinese students. Conclusion: This study highlights the escalation of BDD across populations, urging greater attention from researchers, clinicians, and psychologists to prevent its rise.
BackgroundAnxiety and depression are two of the main psychological disorders that affect thousands of people in the world, including university students. This research is justified because it seeks to reevaluate, compare and confirm the psychometric properties and establish the sociodemographic profile of the Anxiety and Depression Disorders Symptom Scale in Peruvian university students. The main objective of this study was to determine the evidence of psychometric properties, and the sociodemographic profile, of the Symptom Scale for Anxiety and Depression Disorders in university students from the region of Piura, Peru.MethodsThe sample was determined using proportional, probabilistic sampling that included 6 universities in Piura, Peru, consisting of 1243 participants. The scale has 35 Items within 7 subscales.ResultsThe results identified that the items fall within the range of ± 1.5 for skewness and kurtosis, except for items 22 and 35. The construct validity, assessed through factor analysis, shows that 100% of the items achieve scores greater than 0.5, with a significance level of less than < 0.001. The goodness-of-fit index through confirmatory factor analysis aligns with the transdiagnostic theoretical model, with scores for CFI and TLI ≥ 0.90, and for RMSEA and SRMR ≤ 0.60. The scale demonstrates adequate composite reliability according to MacDonald’s Omega Coefficient (0.959). Furthermore, there is a moderate significant association (p= 0.001; γ = − 0.192) between age, the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms. A strong significant association (p= 0.001; γ = 0.365) is observed between sex and the presence of core symptoms of anxiety and depression.ConclusionIn conclusion, the scale evidence an adequate psychometric consistency, presenting itself as a valid and reliable instrument. Of the university students evaluated, it was generally identified that 24% reach a high level and 50% reach a moderate level of anxiety and depression symptoms. Additionally, being a woman and an adolescent increases the likelihood of presenting elevated levels of the symptoms evaluated by the scale.
As a proactive strategy, playful work design allows employees to use ludic or agonistic play to handle hindrances or monotonous tasks. With the help of fun and competition design, they can even transform those tasks into productive work experiences. Drawing on the Job Demands-Resources theory, we analyzed the psychometric properties of the Playful Work Design scale in three studies to adapt and validate the scale for the Romanian population. In the first study, the confirmatory factor analysis results supported the two-factor model. The second study consisted of a longitudinal invariance analysis of the Romanian version of the playful work design scale applied at two different moments and incremental validity analysis beyond other proactive strategies relative to work engagement and performance. The third study found evidence for construct validity (with other constructs that measured playfulness, personal initiative, meaning-making, task complexity, and task monotony) and criterion validity with work-related outcomes (flow at work, engagement, and performance). Altogether, the results demonstrate the validity of the Romanian version of this scale, which can be used in organizations to evaluate playful work design and develop interventions for upgrading employee performance.
In this study, we focused on understanding the aspirations and recommendations of unaccompanied refugee children in host countries, particularly in Jordan. We selected sixteen children based on accessibility and authorization from relevant authorities, prioritizing their privacy and confidentiality. We used a qualitative research methodology, conducting semi-structured interviews to gather the children’s experiences and viewpoints. Our analysis revealed that the children perceive resettlement or family reunification as crucial for their well-being. Economic stability emerged as a key factor, affecting their education and fulfilling higher-order needs. The study also highlighted the lack of effective psychosocial support services and the limited effectiveness of social workers. In conclusion, our findings emphasize the importance of addressing economic stability, overcoming education barriers, and enhancing psychosocial support for unaccompanied refugee children. Additionally, the study suggests a need for a more comprehensive and tailored approach to supporting this vulnerable population and recommends that policy and intervention strategies align with the children’s aspirations to ensure sustainable positive outcomes.
The direction of the relationship between executive functions (EF) and well-being in terms of healthy aging is poorly understood. Further, notwithstanding theoretical differences regarding the multidimensional nature of well-being, few studies have thoroughly clarified the empirical distinctions between hedonic (i.e., happiness through pleasure and life satisfaction) and eudaimonic (i.e., psychological and social) well-being. Therefore, using a large-scale longitudinal dataset, we investigated the bidirectional associations between EF and three facets of well-being (hedonic well-being, psychological well-being, and social well-being) and whether these relationships differed between middle-aged and older adults. Using autoregressive cross-lagged modeling, we found that the latent variable of EF positively predicted eudaimonic well-being for older adults 9 years later. However, we observed no such relationship for middle-aged adults. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the multifaceted construct of well-being and age-related discontinuity in the associations between EF and well-being.
BackgroundThe decision-making process has been investigated separately in the context of externally guided decision-making (EDM, e.g., a gambling task) and internally guided decision-making (IDM, e.g., a preference judgment). In EDM situations, a predictable correct answer exists, and the value of the chosen item increases when positive feedback is received. On the contrary, in IDM situations, there is no objectively correct answer, and participants must decide based on their own internal criteria, such as preference or belief. In IDM, a choice-induced preference change occurs when the value of the chosen item increases and that of the rejected item decreases. However, since these two types of decision-making have been investigated separately, their relationship remains unclear.MethodsThe present study examined the consistency in an individual’s tendency of decision-making reflected in the model parameters (i.e., learning rate and inverse temperature) between EDM and IDM. In this study, participants performed EDM and IDM tasks with different items.ResultsThe findings indicated that an individual’s tendency with respect to how much value is reflected in decision-making (i.e., inverse temperature) between EDM and IDM is consistent. By contrast, no such consistency was observed for the degree of value change after a decision (i.e., the learning rate).ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the close relationship between these two types of decision-making and offers a more comprehensive understanding of the human decision-making process.
BackgroundThe adoption of healthy self-care practices has proven necessary for professional life, as they often serve as a shield against stressors in the workplace. The COVID-19 pandemic created a high strain on general practitioners (GPs), contributing to increased workload, burnout, and anxiety. The present study aimed to identify self-care practices adopted by GPs amid the COVID-19 pandemic; and to explore the relationships between self-care practices and risk of distress.MethodsThe current study utilized an online questionnaire arriving from the PRICOV-19 study, which was distributed among GP practices across 38 countries. The main focus was on the open-text responses where participants disclosed self-care practices employed to maintain mental health during COVID-19. The Six Domains of Self-Care theoretical framework was applied to investigate GP self-care practices across 6 domains including Physical, Professional, Relational, Emotional, Psychological, and Spiritual. The Mayo Clinic Well-Being Index (eWBI) was applied to assess mental well-being and risk of distress among GPs. The analysis was carried out using SPSS Statistics software.ResultsIn total, 2,949 GPs provided open-text responses on maintaining their mental health. 65.5% of GPs had an eWBI score of ≥ 2 and were considered at risk of distress. The majority of the participants prioritised physical (61.7%), followed by relational (38.0%) and psychological (34.6%) self-care practices to maintain their mental health during the pandemic. GPs who applied relational, physical, and professional self-care were significantly less likely to experience depression, stress, and emotional exhaustion, in comparison with the ones who did not apply these practices. GPs who practiced professional self-care practices had the lowest distress risk (eWBI = 1.99). Overall, 5% of GPs disclosed not applying any practices to maintain their mental health during the pandemic and were the most prone to mental health distress.ConclusionsGPs have navigated the pandemic uniquely, and despite applying self-care practices they faced some level of impact, hence self-care interventions for healthcare professionals should be regarded as essential rather than optional. A long-term investment in strategies focused on improving GPs’ self-care is necessary to increase resilience among GPs and ensure their optimal well-being levels are achieved.
Prior research has predominantly examined the role of working memory (WM) in tasks involving numerical information and spatial properties, such as memorizing number sequences and performing parity judgment and magnitude comparison. In contrast to focusing solely on the effect of WM on number judgment tasks, our study investigates how magnitude-space associations affect WM task performance, emphasizing long-term representations, specifically the concept of mental number line (MNL) compatibility (small items on the left, large items on the right) in long-term memory (LTM). Moving from the idea of representations within LTM contribute to the functioning of WM during task execution, we explore the effects of congruent, incongruent, and negative congruent numerical and non-numerical magnitude–space associations on magnitude-based 1-back (low WM load) and 2-back (high WM load) tasks. MNL compatiblen-back and test items are congruent, MNL compatiblen-back and MNL incompatible (small on the right, large on the left) test items (or vice versa) are incongruent, and MNL incompatiblen-back and test items are considered negative congruent. Because negative congruent and incongruent representations may not activate existing representations in LTM, as congruent representations, we expected worse WM performance in negative congruent and incongruent trials than in congruent trials. Results reveal that congruent and incongruent representations elicit more accurate and rapid responses than negative congruents, suggesting that congruent and incongruent representations contribute to task execution. Additionally, we observe a size effect for small numerical magnitudes and a reverse size effect for large physical magnitudes, pointing towards the coactivation of LTM and WM in magnitude–space relations.
Serving Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) evidence prevalent mental health disorders, likely due to diverse occupational stressors including potentially psychologically traumatic events. RCMP cadet mental health when starting the Cadet Training Program (CTP) appears comparable to, or better, than the general public. The CTP is expected to improve mental health, but the mental health of cadets who complete the CTP immediately prior to active-duty deployment remained unknown. The current paper provides estimates of RCMP cadet mental health at pre-deployment. Participants were RCMP cadets who completed a survey assessing self-reported mental health disorder symptoms (n= 449, 73.9% male) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.;n= 466, 75.8% male) at pre-deployment as part of a larger RCMP study. Participant mental health at pre-training was compared between cadets who did (completers) and did not (non-completers) complete the pre-deployment assessments. At pre-deployment, the proportion of completers who screened positive for one or more current mental disorders based on self-reported symptoms (7.3%) or the M.I.N.I. (4.1%) was lower than the diagnostic prevalence for the general population (10.1%), with no statistically significant sex or gender differences. Completers evidenced improved mental health relative to their pre-training assessments, better mental health at pre-training than non-completers, and better mental health than serving RCMP. The current results are the first to describe RCMP cadet mental health at pre-deployment. The results indicate that RCMP deployed from the CTP have excellent mental health, suggesting that protecting RCMP mental health requires ongoing efforts to address the impacts of postdeployment occupational stressors.
BackgroundThe research of the triad of feelings of pain, aggression, and emptiness in the context of the war in Ukraine is relevant and essential for understanding their impact on the health and quality of life of victims, the development of support and rehabilitation, and the process of rebuilding society after the conflict. The purpose of the research on interrelated feelings is to understand their interconnection and influence on each other, to identify the factors and mechanisms underlying this triad, and to determine their impact on human well-being.MethodsSystematisation, analysis, comparison, and typological approach.ResultsThe research has identified that emptiness can increase the feeling of pain, and pain can cause a feeling of emptiness. An analysis of the relationship between feelings of pain and aggression demonstrates that pain can lead to aggressive reactions, and aggression can increase feelings of pain. In addition, it was identified that aggression can increase feelings of emptiness, and emptiness can lead to aggression; risk factors associated with feelings of pain, aggression, and emptiness were found. The research surveyed 100 Ukrainians of all ages on the presence of strong feelings, including pain, aggression, and emptiness. The highest rates of pain (12) were reported by representatives of 26–35 years old, aggression (13) – 18–25 years old, and emptiness (7) – 36–45 years old.ConclusionsThese results provide a deeper understanding of the interaction between these feelings and their impact on human psychological processes, and disclose the causal connections between feelings of pain, aggression, and emptiness, helping to understand how these feelings can interact and affect people’s lives and well-being. The results of the research can be used by scientists, practical psychologists, and psychotherapists to develop effective strategies and interventions for managing destructive feelings.
This paper examines the crucial role of social workers in hospitals, where they are integral to patient-centered care and provide essential clinical support in the realm of complex illness, shared trauma, and loss. To thrive in this environment, social workers need effective and robust clinical supervision to ensure optimal patient care, clinician growth, and emotional support in demanding healthcare settings. Nevertheless, such supervision is often inconsistent in hospitals. This paper explores the complex role of anorganizational supervisor, an onsite supervisor in a hospital setting, and their ability to foster vicarious resilience among clinicians, mitigating the negative effects of compassion fatigue and burnout. Grounded in attachment theory and the trust established by a secure base, the supervisory relationship can be vital in aiding clinicians dealing with suffering and loss to cultivate vicarious resilience. This paper highlights the intimate parallel processes experienced by supervisors and supervisees working with complex illness and loss and examines how institutional regulations impact trust in this relationship dyad. The supervisory process is explored through the lens of attachment theory, emphasizing the importance of human connection and relationships.
Processing the life story is vital to a human’s development, providing individuals with resources and promoting adaptation to changes throughout the life course. Narrative therapy is a main approach in psychotherapy that is found to positively affect individuals’ psychological well-being and mental health. This paper in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie (ZPS) presents the ways narrative therapy is integrated with role play and playback theatre in individual therapy sessions. Dramatic roles from different periods of one’s life are explored simultaneously as part of the therapeutic process to create a concrete and integrative representation of one’s life story. A case study illustrates the integration of narrative therapy, role reversal, and playback theater techniques in one-on-one sessions.
The term “preferred future” refers to the outcomes a client hopes to achieve through psychotherapy. Collaborative goal setting is a crucial component of many psychotherapy approaches. This article describes the six ways to focus on a preferred future in solution-focused brief therapy: (1) common project, (2) Vision of a preferred future, (3) goal(s), (4) skill(s), (5) values, and (6) small signs of progress. All variants are briefly expounded upon with accompanied case examples. The second part of the article focuses on the transitions from problem descriptions to various forms of work related to a preferred future, and on the transitions among different methods of preferred future conversations. The primary purpose of this article is to broaden therapists’ strategies when working with preferred futures, enhancing their adaptability in managing these types of conversations with their clients.
There are few psychometrically sound measures of overprotection designed for the caregiver and focusing largely on overt behaviours and actions. The Parental Overprotection Measure (POM) was developed for research with preschool aged children and has been used in a range of research projects and translated into several languages. However, its full psychometric properties have not previously been reported. The aim of the current paper was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the original, English-language version of the POM. Mothers (N= 288) of children aged between 36 and 71 months completed the POM along with measures assessing validity. A subsample (n= 86) also repeated the POM after approximately 5 weeks. Exploratory factor analysis of the present sample, did not show very clear factor structure and we therefore recommend use of the full scale at this stage. However, two, potentially interpretable factors related to restriction and comfort. Reliability for both factors and the total was strong (alphas and omegas .74 to .90) and the (sub)scales all showed good retest reliability (.72 to .75). Correlations with other measures of overprotection were moderate for the total and restriction scales but smaller for comfort and the two subscales correlated differently from each other with other aspects of parenting. The total and restriction subscale correlated moderately with child anxiety but the comfort subscale failed to relate significantly. Overall, the POM shows solid psychometric properties and could be used as a self-report measure of caregiver overprotection.
BackgroundSelf-care education is one method used to reduce the complications of chronic diseases like Multiple sclerosis which affects self-efficacy. The present study evaluated the effect of self-care training by nurses on the self-efficacy of patients with multiple sclerosis.MethodsThis is a randomized clinical trial with pre-test/ post-test. The statistical population of this study included all patients with multiple sclerosis who were members of the Iranian Multiple Sclerosis Association, from whom 90 patients were selected and divided into two groups of intervention and control (n= 45 people in each group), through a table of random numbers. First, both groups completed the demographic information and Sherer's self-efficacy questionnaire. Then, a self-care empowerment program was delivered to patients in the intervention group. Eight weeks later, the self-efficacy questionnaires were completed again by both intervention and control groups. The data were analyzed using SPSS-22 statistical software.ResultsThe mean self-efficacy score in the intervention group was (60.27 ± 8.63) and in the control group was (59.07 ± 6.84) before the intervention. After the intervention, a statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding the mean self-efficacy scores (p= 0.004). The mean self-efficacy scores in the intervention and control groups were (63.73 ± 6.97) and (59.21 ± 6.23) after the intervention.ConclusionsA Self-care training program can be used as one of the methods to improve self-efficacy in patients with multiple sclerosis.Trial registrationThe protocol of this clinical trial has been registered in the Iranian Clinical Trial Registration Center (registration code: IRCT20180914041036N1). Registered 18 January 2019- Retrospectively registered, date of first recruitment.
ObjectivesThe study aimed to examine the impact of incorporating Buddhist ethics-based practices versus Buddhist ethics- and wisdom-based practices in an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on prosocial behaviour.MethodChanges in behaviour were evaluated through the subcategories of monetary donation, prosocial attitudes, and volunteering engagement. Participants at a British university in China (n=67) were randomly assigned to either an MBI including concentration- and ethics-based practice (MBI-CE) or an MBI including concentration-, ethics-, and wisdom-based practice (MBI-CEW), with a study-as-usual control group. Throughout the intervention, participants attended weekly 2-hr face-to-face sessions and maintained daily meditation journals.ResultsResults showed that MBI-CEW participants exhibited significant increases in prosocial behaviour compared to MBI-CE and controls. No significant difference was observed in dispositional mindfulness or ethical responsibility between intervention groups. However, the MBI-CEW group experienced greater changes in levels of sense of connectedness, as well as greater changes in levels of prosocial tendencies than the MBI-CE group.ConclusionsThe findings emphasize the influence of integrating wisdom-based practices into MBIs on prosocial behaviour and suggest that transcending an individualistic sense of self may play a more prominent role in enhancing prosocial tendencies than heightened awareness or moral reasoning.PreregistrationThis study was not preregistered
Black women in the United States experience sexual harassment and violence at rates much higher than do White women, suffering greater psychological and physical harm. We examined how White Racial Identity, race of the female victim, and characteristics of the perpetrator combine to influence White Americans’ willingness to respond in a supportive way toward the sexual harassment complainant (i.e., allyship). White US participants (N= 419) completed a racial identity measure and read about a White male supervisor’s alleged workplace sexual harassment (with violence) of a Black or White female subordinate. The supervisor was portrayed with characteristics to elicit perceptions of high or low supervisor benevolence. As hypothesized and consistent with the aversive racism framework, for the Black complainant only, in the high (but not low) supervisor benevolence condition, stronger White racial identity predicted markedly lower intervention intentions and less supervisor-directed punishment. The effects were mediated by lower perceived complainant suffering. These findings offer insights into the complex dynamics influencing allyship, making White Americans more aware of the factors that may subtly shape their willingness to intervene and offer support for Black women who are victims of interracial sexual harassment, as well informing the development of interventions to produce more equitable treatment of Black women in the workplace.
Numerous studies have indicated that aggressive behavior is influenced by both environmental factors and individual factors. Parental rearing styles, as an environmental factor, and behavioral inhibition/activation, as individual factors, play crucial roles in shaping aggressive behavior. To investigate the aggressive behavior of inmates and its relationship with parental rearing styles and behavioral inhibition/activation, 414 inmates were assessed using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ), the Parental Rearing Styles Questionnaire (EMBU), and the Behavioral Inhibition/Activation System Scale (BIS/BAS). The aggressiveness of the inmates was divided into a low-aggressiveness group (29.47%), a mild-aggressiveness group (34.06%), a medium-aggressiveness group (29.47%) and a high-aggressiveness group (7.00%). The results showed that the variable of mother’s intervention and overprotection was related to the mild-aggressiveness group and medium- aggressiveness group; that the lower the emotional warmth score was, the more likely the individual was to be classified into the medium- aggressiveness group; that the variables of father’s denial or rejection and mother’s strict punishment were related to the high-aggressiveness group; and that behavioral inhibition was related to only the medium-aggressiveness group and the high-aggressiveness group.
Minority college students represent a significant sub-group in China. They face challenges and risks related to acculturative stress and depression in cross-cultural contexts, which may impair their physical and mental development and, in turn, affect the ethnic unity of Chinese society. Therefore, their acculturative stress and depression is an issue of concern. The present study examined the relationship between acculturative stress and depression among college students from minority backgrounds in China using immediate moderated mediation and delayed moderated mediation model. This longitudinal study involved a one-year follow up period. A total of 312 minority college students were recruited in Beijing, China. During wave 1, 205 participants being followed-up at wave 2. Participants completed self-reported questionnaires measuring acculturative stress, depression, hope, and cultural intelligence. The results indicated a strong positive association between acculturative stress and depressive symptoms. In the immediate and delayed predictions of depression by acculturative stress, immediate/delayed hope plays a mediating role, respectively. As cultural intelligence increases, the immediate predictive effect of hope on depression weakens. When cultural intelligence is high, both the delayed direct and indirect effects of acculturative stress on depression are weakened.
Learning and remembering what things are used for is a capacity that is central to successfully living in any human culture. The current paper investigates whether functional facts (information about what an object is used for) are remembered more efficiently compared with nonfunctional facts. Experiment 1 presented participants with images of functionally ambiguous objects associated with a (made-up) name and a (made-up) fact that could relate either to the object’s function or to something nonfunctional. Results show that recall of object names did not depend on whether they were associated with a functional or nonfunctional fact, while recall of the functional facts was significantly better than the nonfunctional facts. The second experiment replicated this main effect and further found that functional facts are remembered more efficiently after they have been associated with confirmatory (as opposed to disconfirmatory) feedback. It is suggested that semantic information is not unitary, and that one way of categorising semantic information is in terms of its adaptive relevance. Potential mechanisms are proposed and discussed, along with suggestions for future research.
Black people were more likely to be infected and died from the COVID-19 in Canada because of the pre-existing social, economic, health disparities, and experiences of pervasive racism. The traumatic experience of the Black communities during this pandemic remains unknown. Using the CanBlackVax survey, this study aims to investigate sociodemographic characteristics and factors related to COVID-19 related traumatic stress in Black Canadian communities in Canada. A total of 2002 (51.66% women, mean age = 29.34, SD = 10.13) were recruited across 7 provinces in Canada (Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, New-Brunswick, and Manitoba). Participants completed measures assessing COVID-19 related stressors, health literacy, conspiracy beliefs, everyday discrimination, and major racial discrimination. Results showed that COVID-19 related traumatic stress score was higher in men (M= 25.55,SD= 10.29) and participants who had no history of COVID-19 infection (M= 25.35,SD= 9.85), compared to women (M= 23.61,SD= 8.80),t(1906.04) = 4.52,p< .001) and those with a history of infection (M= 23.49,SD= 9.15),t(1919.60) = 4.35,p< .001. Findings showed that being young, high income, healthy literacy, and history of COVID-19 infection were protective factors related to COVID-19 stress, while every day and major racial discrimination were strong risk factors. This study offers avenues for future research and public health programs, tools, and strategies development. It shows the need to stop the color-blind approach in research, strengthen health literacy, and rid society of racial discrimination.
While individuals with impulsivity tend to engage in risk-taking or unplanned behaviors, those with anxiety demonstrate risk avoidance or excessive worrying, seemingly incongruent with one another. However, a subset of individuals exhibits both traits. Here, we aim to examine separable functional connectivity patterns based on impulsivity and anxiety to better understand these individual differences. We utilized a publicly available fMRI dataset to compare rsFC between the High Impulsivity (HI) group and High Anxiety (HA) group. Additionally, we identified specific networks within the High Impulsivity & High Anxiety (HIHA) group by comparing them with both the HI and HA groups. The HI group exhibited heightened functional connectivity mainly consisted of the cerebellum, whereas the HA group displayed increased connectivity primarily involving the medial frontal network (MFN) and the motor networks. Conversely, the HIHA group demonstrated decreased MFN–cerebellar connectivity while also showing increased connectivity within the MFN. These findings suggest that insufficient regulation of the MFN may have contributed to the failure to control impulsive and anxious traits.
Individuals often rely on the advice of more experienced peers to minimise uncertainty and increase success likelihood. In most domains where knowledge is acquired through experience, advisers are themselves continuously learning. Here we examine the way advising behaviour changes throughout the learning process, and the way individual traits and costs and benefits of giving advice shape this behaviour. We ran a series of experiments implementing a decision task within a reinforcement learning framework, where participants could decide to share their choices as advice to others. Participants were overall likely to share their choices as advice, even on the first trial before learning. Tendency to share advice and advice quality increased as advisers learned about the value of choices, and moved from exploratory to exploitative behaviour. The introduction of consequences to advising resulted in a shift of the overall tendency to give advice, lowering it when advising implicated monetary loss, and increasing it when advising held reputational value. Individual differences in social anxiety levels were associated with lower tendency to share exploratory decisions. Our results show that advisers tend to share choices that are backed by their own experience, but that this relationship can be altered by advice-consequences and individual traits.
A key recent discussion in the sentence processing literature centers on the primary mechanism of the human processing system: the extent to which it engages in a consistent and immediate process of generating and revising expectations, versus regular incorporation of new input with the developing representations through integration processes. The current study probes these two mechanisms by investigating declarative sentence processing in the understudied verb-initial, flexible word order language Tagalog. Tagalog verbs contain grammatical information that is probabilistically informative of the likely word order of the sentence. Experiment 1 (sentence completion task) showed that Tagalog word order completions for the first and second noun phrases were driven by a preference to place the agent and the syntactically prominent argument (pivot) in the first and second argument positions, respectively, and that such preferences vary by grammatical voice and semantic verb class type. Completions in Experiment 1 were used to compute for expectation-based conditional probabilities and surprisal for nominal markers of the upcoming first and second arguments, conditioned by voice and verb class. These values were then used to test how online reading measures at the first and second nominal markers in Experiment 2 (word-by-word self-paced reading) reflected expectation and integration-based processes. Overall online measures demonstrated dynamic incremental effects across the sentence that were only partially consistent with expectation-based hypotheses. The results highlight the importance of incorporating integration processes in sentence processing models.
Amygdala activation by emotional arousal during memory formation can prioritize events for long-term memory. Building upon our prior demonstration that brief electrical stimulation to the human amygdala reliably improved long-term recognition memory for images of neutral objects without eliciting an emotional response, our study aims to explore and describe individual differences and stimulation-related factors in amygdala-mediated memory modulation. Thirty-one patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for intractable epilepsy were shown neutral object images paired with direct amygdala stimulation during encoding with recognition memory tested immediately and one day later. Adding to our prior sample, we found an overall memory enhancement effect without subjective emotional arousal at the one-day delay, but not at the immediate delay, for previously stimulated objects compared to not stimulated objects. Importantly, we observed a larger variation in performance across this larger sample than our initial sample, including some participants who showed a memory impairment for stimulated objects. Of the explored individual differences, the factor that most accounted for variability in memory modulation was each participant’s pre-operative memory performance. Worse memory performance on standardized neuropsychological tests was associated with a stronger susceptibility to memory modulation in a positive or negative direction. Sex differences and the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) during testing also accounted for some variance in amygdala-mediated memory modulation. Given the potential and challenges of this memory modulation approach, we discuss additional individual and stimulation factors that we hope will differentiate between memory enhancement and impairment to further optimize the potential of amygdala-mediated memory enhancement for therapeutic interventions.
Despite the high prevalence of sexual objectification, the understanding of gender differences in its victimization and perpetration remains limited. We bridged victim and perpetrator perspectives, expecting that objectification victimization positively predicts perpetration, and investigated the mediating role of social dominance orientation (SDO), and gender and perceived social mobility as moderators. Participants (validN= 530) completed measures of sexual objectification victimization, perceived social mobility, SDO, and sexual objectification perpetration. We found that sexual objectification victimization predicted its perpetration, and that this relationship was stronger among men than women. SDO partially mediated the moderation effect of gender, whereby mediation through SDO was significant among men, but not significant among women. Moreover, a three-way interaction between sexual objectification victimization, gender, and perceived social mobility predicted SDO and carried subsequent implications for sexual objectification perpetration. Despite the mediation effect through SDO not achieving significance among women, it was significantly moderated by perceived social mobility. Specifically, the indirect effect among women with high perceived social mobility was significantly different than that among women with low perceived social mobility, but not significantly different than that among men, whose results were not influenced by perceived social mobility. This study provides a more nuanced understanding of gender in sexual objectification—specifically that gender differences may be related to social power and differences in socialization. The findings offer implications for the development of theories and clinical programs for coping with objectification victimization and preventing perpetration.
Experimental psychologists and psycholinguists increasingly turn to online research for data collection due to the ease of sampling many diverse participants in parallel. Online research has shown promising validity and consistency, but is it suitable for all paradigms? Specifically, is it reliable enough for individual differences research? The current paper reports performance on 15 tasks from a psycholinguistic individual differences battery, including timed and untimed assessments of linguistic abilities, as well as domain-general skills. From a demographically homogenous sample of young Dutch people, 149 participants participated in the lab study, and 515 participated online. Our results indicate that there is no reason to assume that participants tested online will underperform compared to lab-based testing, though they highlight the importance of motivation and the potential for external help (e.g., through looking up answers) online. Overall, we conclude that there is reason for optimism in the future of online research into individual differences.
Irrespective of the precision, the inaccuracy of a pupil-based eye tracker is about 0.5\(^\circ \). This paper delves into two factors that potentially increase the inaccuracy of the gaze signal, namely, 1) Pupil-size changes and the pupil-size artefact (PSA) and 2) the putative inability of experienced individuals to precisely refixate a visual target. Experiment 1 utilizes a traditional pupil-CR eye tracker, while Experiment 2 employs a retinal eye tracker, the FreezeEye tracker, eliminating the pupil-based estimation. Results reveal that the PSA significantly affects gaze accuracy, introducing up to 0.5\(^\circ \)inaccuracies during calibration and validation. Corrections based on the relation between pupil size and apparent gaze shift substantially reduce inaccuracies, underscoring the PSA’s influence on eye-tracking quality. Conversely, Experiment 2 demonstrates humans’ precise refixation abilities, suggesting that the accuracy of the gaze signal is not limited by human refixation inconsistencies.
In our everyday experience, the sizes and weights of objects we encounter are strongly correlated. When objects are lifted, visual information about size can be combined with haptic feedback about weight, and a naive application of Bayes’ rule predicts that the perceived weight of larger objects should be exaggerated and smaller objects underestimated. Instead, it is the smaller of two objects of equal weight that is perceived as heavier, a phenomenon termed the Size-Weight Illusion (SWI). Here we provide a normative explanation of the SWI based on principles of efficient coding, which dictate that stimulus properties should be encoded with a fidelity that depends on how frequently those properties are encountered in the environment. We show that the precision with which human observers estimate object weight varies as a function of both mass and volume in a manner consistent with the estimated joint distribution of those properties among everyday objects. We further show that participants’ seemingly “anti-Bayesian” biases (the SWI) are quantitatively predicted by Bayesian estimation when taking into account the gradient of discriminability induced by efficient encoding. The related Material-Weight Illusion (MWI) can also be accounted for on these principles, with surface material providing a visual cue that changes expectations about object density. The efficient coding model is further compatible with a wide range of previous observations, including the adaptability of weight illusions and properties of “non-illusory” objects. The framework is general and predicts perceptual biases and variability in any sensory properties that are correlated in the natural environment.
This study examines the emotional consequences of spending choices in everyday life across a diverse multinational sample. Based on a dataset of 200 participants across 7 countries who received $10,000 USD, we analyzed how happy they felt from different types of purchases made with that money. Participants derived high levels of happiness from some types of purchases that have been examined in past research (e.g., buying experiences), but also from other purchases (e.g., education) that have not been the focus of previous work. We found some evidence that the emotional benefits of spending choices varied depending on whether participants lived in higher vs. lower-income countries; specifically, we found differences in the benefits of spending on gifts, housing, debt, and time-saving services. Around the world, people who spent money in ways that made them happy experienced greater improvements in overall subjective well-being 3 and 6 months later.
The attentional blink (AB) paradigm is frequently used to investigate temporal attention. Essentially, rapid serial visual streams of several distractors and two targets are presented. The accuracy in detecting the second target stimulus (T2) decreases in the time window between 100 and 500 ms following accurate detection of the first target stimulus (T1). In two experiments, Colzato et al.Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics,76, 1510–1515, (2014) reported evidence for a modulation of the AB effect depending on the presentation of different ambient odors: Peppermint increased the AB compared with lavender. In the current study, we tried to replicate their basic findings while using different methods and procedures to present the lavender versus peppermint odorants. In three experiments, we found no evidence that these odorants influence the AB effect. We discuss our findings in comparison with those from Colzato et al., in relation to other empirical research in this field as well as in regard to different hypotheses concerning how odorants may influence human cognition.
The author discusses the psychotherapy of a 41-year-old Caucasian man who complained of a somatic symptom characterized as an “energy” that formulated the words, “I’m gay.” A practitioner of yogic philosophy, the patient came to believe that someone—perhaps a priest—had sexually abused him at age 8 or 9. The author assesses the patient’s attachment relationships to his parents and to his Higher Power and then discusses their similarities and differences. The author also discusses the attachment-informed interventions that have propelled the treatment forward, ending the article by posing spiritual and emotional questions that linger in the patient’s ongoing treatment.
Hank Pennypacker’s interest in behavioral measurement began early in his career and gradually became the centerpiece of his diverse accomplishments. A review of his focus in the 1960s is followed by a brief summary of the evolution of behavioral measurement practices in applied behavior analysis as it emerged from the field’s laboratory history. This examination serves as pretext for a discussion of the contributions ofStrategies and Tactics of Human Behavioral Research(Johnston & Pennypacker,1980),Strategies and Tactics of Behavioral Research(Johnston & Pennypacker,1993a,2009), andStrategies and Tactics of Behavioral Research and Practice (Johnston et al.,2020) to emerging matters of behavioral measurement. That discussion focuses on how issues raised by the challenges of applied research and practice have evolved.
Cognitive reserve (CR) and busyness can boost memory, whereas stress can impair memory. Nevertheless, extant research has not yet examined busyness in conjunction with CR and stress, nor whether CR or stress moderate the relationship between busyness and episodic memory. Middle-aged and older adult participants (N= 71; ages 50–74; 31% African-American) answered lifestyle questionnaires and completed a visual paired-associate memory fMRI task. Dimension reduction techniques identified two latent CR factors—personal CR(own education; occupation complexity; socioeconomic status) andparental education(mother’s/father’s education), and identified two latent stress factors—external stress(neighborhood stress/violence; financial strain) andpersonal stress(perceived stress; work/personal stress). We cast these latent factors into a series of regression models, revealing that (1) in isolation, higher busyness predicted better episodic memory, (2) higher external stress predicted worse memory, (3) both greater personal CR and greater parental education predicted better memory, (4) busyness did not interact with stress nor with CR, and (5) in a combined model, higher parental education and lower external stress were significant independent predictors. Neuroimaging data revealed that higher CR was associated with more efficient brain activity in the hippocampus and posterior cingulate during successful episodic memory retrieval, whereas higher personal stress was associated with heightened activity in the precuneus. No interactions or main effects of busyness were observed for the fMRI data. Thus, although busyness was associated with superior episodic memory, busyness did not modulate brain activity during episodic memory retrieval, nor did CR or stress moderate the relationship between busyness and associative memory.
With the growing popularity of live streaming shopping, designing an effective live streaming commercial strategy is a focus for retailers as well as researchers. Drawing on stimulus-organic-response model and feeling-as-information theory, the current study explores the role of congruence between live streaming elements and the product in facilitating shopping intention in live streaming shopping context. A total of 543 customers who engaged in live streaming shopping in the past three months were surveyed and asked to reflect on one recent experience for completing the questionnaire. We conducted a series of confirmatory factor analyses to ascertain the research constructs’ reliability and validity. Furthermore, structural equation modeling was performed to test the research hypotheses. By distinguishing three forms of congruence between commercial elements and products (that between products and live stream content, atmosphere, and streamer, respectively), we found that a higher fit of live streaming elements with the product contributed to higher purchase intention via improved processing fluency and increased perceived authenticity of the product. From a cognitive perspective, our findings enrich the understanding of congruence between key live commercial elements and products. Specifically, our study highlights the significance of contextual stimuli in live streaming, by demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting sales through a cognitive friendly consumption experience. Additionally, it offers practical insights for optimizing design and sales promotion in the live streaming environment.
According to the QBIT theory, consciousness depends on the emergence of macroscopic coherence in a specific intracellular substrate which registers and processes sensory information. This occurs in a particular neuronal compartment called the axon initial segment which has unique properties not found in other neuronal segments. These unique properties allow the integration of synaptic inputs, amplification of sensory signals, and spontaneous emergence of coherence which is necessary for conscious perception.
Theoretical frameworks suggest that cognitive inhibition suppresses irrelevant information in working memory, preventing overload and promoting the processing of task-relevant information. Consequently, it may also contribute to more complex skills, such as abstract reasoning, by facilitating the retention and processing of patterns and relationships. However, empirical evidence does not consistently show these relationships in early elementary school years. This study aims to examine the validity of the following theoretical proposition: cognitive inhibition is a fundamental process that influences working memory, and both contribute to abstract reasoning in children aged 6–8 years. The final sample included 293 schoolchildren from 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grades, who completed tasks measuring cognitive inhibition, working memory, and reasoning. Age was also considered in the analyses. The main results indicate that age is associated with improvements in working memory and reasoning (explaining 19% of the variance), but not with cognitive inhibition performance. Additionally, cognitive inhibition directly contributes to working memory (explaining 19% of the variance), and working memory, but not cognitive inhibition, contributes to abstract reasoning (the model explains 23% of the variance). No indirect effects were found. We discuss the importance of incorporating specific relationships between cognitive skills at different developmental stages into theoretical and practical proposals.
Memory encoding and retrieval constitute neurally dissociable brain states and prior behavioral work suggests that these states may linger in time. Thus memory states may influence both the current experience and subsequent events; however, this account has not been directly tested. To test the hypothesis that memory judgments induce brain states that persist for several hundred milliseconds, we recorded scalp electroencephalography while participants completed a recognition task. We used an independently validated multivariate mnemonic state classifier to assess memory state engagement. We replicate previous behavioral findings, yet we find that memory states are modulated by response congruency. We find strong retrieval state engagement on incongruent trials, when the response switches between two consecutive trials. These findings indicate that cortical brain states are influenced by prior judgments and suggest that a non-mnemonic, internal attention state may be recruited in the face of changing demands in a dynamic environment.
Promotion holds a significant position in marketing and is a vital strategy for sales growth. According to previous research, promotional activities aimed at core products can increase sales of other products. However, the specific attributes of these products that are affected by such promotions remain unclear. To address this issue, the present research establishes a conceptual framework based on mental accounting theory and construal level theory. It argues that prepaid coupon purchase behavior for promotional products positively influences complementary product purchase intention, with this effect mediated by psychological ownership and process simulation. Across three studies, consistent findings indicate that coupon purchases for promotional products exhibit spillover effects on the purchases of complementary products among product combinations featuring varying degrees of complementarity. This paper offers new insights into the research on coupon, prepayment, conditional promotions, psychological theories, and complementary product consumption, providing practical implications for retailers, brands, online shopping platforms, governments, and educators following their participation in promotions to better understand and accommodate the evolving needs of consumers.
Brazil’sCriança Feliz Programis one of the largest early childhood development home-visiting programs globally. After seven years of scaling up, implementation barriers across diverse municipality settings prevented the program from achieving the intended impact on parenting skills and child development. We conducted a program impact pathway analysis to generate a blueprint to enhance implementation quality by (1) identifying the critical quality control points that need to be monitored throughout the scaling up and (2) specifying implementation strategies for enhancing implementation quality. The program impact pathway analysis consisted of inductive and deductive coding of pre-existing retrospective (e.g. reports, and codebooks from in-depth interviews) and workshop with national team to identify the critical quality control points and corresponding implementation barriers and facilitators. The Expert Recommendations for Implementation Change taxonomy was used to specify implementation strategies facilitating the scaling up or opportunities to address barriers across critical quality control points. We identified seven critical quality control points: hiring municipal workforce; staff training; home visits; complementary multisectoral actions; municipal supervision; technical assistance and monitoring; and funding. Implementation strategies facilitating the scale-up were “providing assistance” and “supporting teams;” opportunities for enhancing implementation quality were “financial strategies” and “evaluative and iterative strategies.” Our analysis identified seven critical quality control points necessary to achieve the intended implementation and program outcomes. The combined use of the program impact pathway and the Expert Recommendations for Implementation Change taxonomy generated a meaningful blueprint of implementation strategies to enhance implementation quality, which may support the sustainability of a large-scale program.
Artificial intelligence techniques offer promising avenues for exploring human body features from videos, yet no freely accessible tool has reliably provided holistic and fine-grained behavioral analyses to date. To address this, we developed a machine learning tool based on a two-level approach: a first lower-level processing using computer vision for extracting fine-grained and comprehensive behavioral features such as skeleton or facial points, gaze, and action units; a second level of machine learning classification coupled with explainability providing modularity, to determine which behavioral features are triggered by specific environments. To validate our tool, we filmed 16 participants across six conditions, varying according to the presence of a person (“Pers”), a sound (“Snd”), or silence (“Rest”), and according to emotional levels using self-referential (“Self”) and control (“Ctrl”) stimuli. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach by extracting and correcting behavior from videos using two computer vision software (OpenPose and OpenFace) and by training two algorithms (XGBoost and long short-term memory [LSTM]) to differentiate between experimental conditions. High classification rates were achieved for “Pers” conditions versus “Snd” or “Rest” (AUC = 0.8–0.9), with explainability revealing actions units and gaze as key features. Additionally, moderate classification rates were attained for “Snd” versus “Rest” (AUC = 0.7), attributed to action units, limbs and head points, as well as for “Self” versus “Ctrl” (AUC = 0.7–0.8), due to facial points. These findings were consistent with a more conventional hypothesis-driven approach. Overall, our study suggests that our tool is well suited for holistic and fine-grained behavioral analysis and offers modularity for extension into more complex naturalistic environments.
The growing interest in harnessing natural environments to enhance mental health, including cognitive functioning and mood, has yielded encouraging results in initial studies. Given that images of nature have demonstrated similar benefits, they are frequently employed as proxies for real-world environments. To ensure precision and control, researchers often manipulate images of natural environments. The effectiveness of this approach relies on standardization of imagery, and therefore, inconsistency in methods and stimuli has limited the synthesis of research findings in the area. Responding to these limitations, the current paper introduces the Salford Nature Environments Database (SNED), a standardized database of natural images created to support ongoing research into the benefits of nature exposure. The SNED currently exists as the most comprehensive nature image database available, comprising 500 high-quality, standardized photographs capturing a variety of possible natural environments across the seasons. It also includes normative scores for user-rated (801 participants) characteristics of fascination, refuge and prospect, compatibility, preference, valence, arousal, and approach–avoidance, as well as data on physical properties of the images, specifically luminance, contrast, entropy, CIELAB colour space parameter values, and fractal dimensions. All image ratings and content detail, along with participant details, are freely available online. Researchers are encouraged to use this open-access database in accordance with the specific aims and design of their study. The SNED represents a valuable resource for continued research in areas such as nature-based therapy, social prescribing, and experimental approaches investigating underlying mechanisms that help explain how natural environments improve mental health and wellbeing.
Cognitive control develops throughout adolescence, a high-risk period for bipolar disorders (BD) onset. Despite neurobehavioral abnormalities in adults with BD, there is minimal research investigating deviations in cognitive control in adolescents with BD. Cognitive control involves numerous processes. Identifying the specific neural abnormalities in adolescent BD could provide precise targets for novel interventions that improve illness outcomes. The present study administered a Go/No-Go (GNG) task to 98 adolescents (44 BD; 54 controls) to activate response inhibition and error processes and recorded EEG for event-related potentials (ERPs) analysis. Stimulus-locked N2 and P3 (response inhibition) and response-locked error-related negativity (ERN; early error detection) and error positivity (Pe; conscious error detection) were analyzed. Adolescents with BD had attenuated Pe mean amplitudes following failed inhibition trials. There were no group differences in other ERP amplitudes, including N2, P3, and ERN. The pattern of findings implicates conscious error detection impairment in adolescents with BD, without support for deficits in more automatic, earlier error detection. Impaired conscious error detection in adolescents with BD may be an early expression of BD pathophysiology and a possible intervention target for cognitive rehabilitation. Further studies are needed to examine Pe in BD across the lifetime.
The extent to which a belief is rooted in one’s sense of morality has significant societal implications. While moral conviction can inspire positive collective action, it can also prompt dogmatism, intolerance, and societal divisions. Research in social psychology has documented the functional characteristics of moral conviction and shows that poor metacognition exacerbates its negative outcomes. However, the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying moral conviction, their relationship with metacognition, and how moral conviction is integrated into the valuation and decision-making process remain unclear. This study investigated these neurocognitive processes during decision-making on sociopolitical issues varying in moral conviction. Participants (N = 44) underwent fMRI scanning while deciding, on each trial, which of two groups of political protesters they supported more. As predicted, stronger moral conviction was associated with faster decision times. Hemodynamic responses in the anterior insula (aINS), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) were elevated during decisions with higher moral conviction, supporting the emotional and cognitive dimensions of moral conviction. Functional connectivity between lPFC and vmPFC was greater on trials higher in moral conviction, elucidating mechanisms through which moral conviction is incorporated into valuation. Average support for the two displayed groups of protesters was positively associated with brain activity in regions involved in valuation, particularly vmPFC and amygdala. Metacognitive sensitivity, the ability to discriminate one’s correct from incorrect judgments, measured in a perceptual task, negatively correlated with parametric effects of moral conviction in the brain, providing new evidence that metacognition modulates responses to morally convicted issues.
BackgroundAccess to evidence-based treatments such as family-based therapy (FBT) is difficult for adolescents diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) living in rural or regional areas due to a limited trained workforce, high staff turnover and inconsistent treatment fidelity. Telehealth offers a potential access solution by facilitating care irrespective of family or service location. The disruption to the health system caused by COVID-19 amplified an existing need and increased the use of telehealth to deliver FBT before its efficacy and safety was fully evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of telehealth-FBT delivered by community-based clinicians within rural services directly into the home to reduce the eating disorder symptoms of adolescents diagnosed with AN.MethodsA pre- and post-implementation multi-site case series delivered up to 20 sessions of telehealth-FBT to 28 adolescents (89.29% female,M= 14.68 ± 1.58 years) living in rural or regional Australia. The RE-AIM framework guided the evaluation, with Reach (treatment uptake and completion); Efficacy (change in weight, global eating disorder symptoms, and remission from baseline to end of treatment and six-month follow-up); Adoption (patient characteristics and drop out); Implementation (intervention fidelity) and Maintenance (outcomes and intervention during the follow-up period) used to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of telehealth-FBT.ResultsThere was a high level of interest in telehealth-FBT, with two-thirds of eligible families consenting to participate. Both treatment engagement and completion rates were over 60%, and treatment was delivered with acceptable fidelity. Twenty adolescents (71.43%) met the diagnostic criteria for AN (baseline 86.03%mBMI ± 7.14), and eight (28.57%) for Atypical AN (baseline 101.34%mBMI ± 8.28), with an overall mean duration of illness of 8.53 months (SD= 5.39, range 2–24 months). There was a significant increase in %mBMI at the end of treatment compared to the baseline (p= 0.007, 95%CI: 1.04–6.65), with over 68% of adolescents weight restored and 36.8% of these achieving both weight and psychological remission criteria. Weight remained significantly improved at six-month follow-up (p= 0.005, 95%CI: 1.57–8.65). Also, there was a decrease in adolescents’ global eating disorder symptoms, as rated by their parents, at the end of treatment compared to the baseline of 0.735 (p= 0.028, 95%CI: 0.079–1.385).ConclusionsTelehealth-FBT was feasibly implemented into rural services and delivered by community clinicians with reach, adoption, preliminary efficacy, and fidelity scores comparable to those reported by specialist studies.Trial registrationThe study was conducted according to the HREC-approved protocol (HREC 2020/ETH00186) and registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR # 12620001107910).
Temporal binding refers to the subjective shortening of time between a cause and its effect compared with two unrelated events. The effect has been extensively explored over the past two decades and manifests across a robust range of paradigms, reflecting two distinct expressions of binding: (1) the subjective shortening of elapsed time between cause and effect and (2) the subjective attraction of cause and effect to each other. However, whether and how these binding expressions are related is still largely unknown. In this study, we report two experiments, employing four tasks (stimulus anticipation, Libet clock, interval estimation, and reproduction). We computed within and between session and task correlations across two (Experiment 1) and six (Experiment 2) sessions. Across both experiments, we successfully replicated temporal binding in temporal estimation, temporal reproduction, and the Libet clock, but not in stimulus anticipation. Good within-task and within-session reliability were observed, but reliability between sessions was poor. Correlation analyses revealed associations between binding effects measured via temporal estimation and temporal reproduction, underscoring task-dependent variations, in line with the suggestion that different temporal tasks tap into distinct facets of the temporal binding effect. This nuanced understanding contributes to refining experimental paradigms and advancing the comprehension of human temporal processing. The data, materials, and experiments from the present study are publicly available.
Emotional labor, the act of suppressing or altering one’s feelings to enhance another person’s well-being, is predominantly performed by women, especially within intimate relationships. Despite its impact on well-being, research on its role in sexuality remains limited. We developed the Women’s Sexual Emotional Labor Assessment (WOSELA), a 12-item scale based on themes identified by past qualitative studies. To ensure its reliability and validity, we conducted three studies with women partnered with men, as well as heterosexual single women from the UK and the USA (N= 831). Drawing on exploratory factor analysis in Study 1, four subscales were identified: faking orgasm, performing desire, tolerating discomfort or pain, and partner-referenced sexual satisfaction. Confirmatory factor analyses in Study 2 (pre-registered) provided support for the WOSELA in its current form. In Study 3 (pre-registered), we demonstrated the validity of the WOSELA by establishing significant negative correlations with sexual agency, sexual communication, and sexual pleasure. Our results further show that the WOSELA was not significantly related to positive-partner-oriented sexual responsiveness. The WOSELA offers a unique tool to explore the role of emotional labor in sustaining the pleasure gap, as well as in broader power dynamics within intimate relationships and its impact on women’s well-being.
Social capital is an important construct in diverse scientific disciplines for understanding health promotion, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. In an increasingly digitalized world, social capital can be established and used in both online and offline contexts. Previous research suggests that personality might be relevant to an understanding of individual differences in social capital. For instance, the literature suggests that extraversion is associated with more social capital. Against this background, the present study aimed to revisit social capital research, but with a broader focus on studying all Big Five Personality traits (assessed with the BFI-45) and their association with bonding (similarity-based relationships), bridging (diversity-based relationships) social capital dimensions, and well-being. Insights in social capital variables in offline and online areas were obtained via the Internet Social Capital Scale and well-being was assessed with Diener’s Satisfaction with Life scale. In particular, the study aimed to understand if personality-well-being associations would emerge with online/offline social capital being a mediator. The questionnaires were filled in byn= 289 German speaking participants (73 males and 216 females). The results revealed that offline social capital in the form of bridging and bonding played a significant role in mediating the relationship between both agreeableness and extraversion with life satisfaction. Online social capital was not associated with life satisfaction and was only very weakly linked to some Big Five Personality traits. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that offline social capital is very relevant for well-being, while online social capital shows no association with self-reported well-being levels and seems to be negligible for an understanding of well-being.
How do we assess the veracity of ambiguous news, and does metacognition guide our decisions to seek further information? In a controlled experiment, participants evaluated the veracity of ambiguous news and decided whether to seek extra information. Confidence in their veracity judgments did not predict accuracy, showing limited metacognitive ability when facing ambiguous news. Despite this, confidence in one’s judgment was the primary driver of the demand for additional information about the news. Lower confidence predicted a stronger desire for extra information, regardless of the veracity judgment. Two key news characteristics led individuals to confidently misinterpret both true and fake news. News imprecision and news tendency to polarize opinions increased the likelihood of misjudgment, highlighting individuals’ vulnerability to ambiguity. Structural equation modeling revealed that the demand for disambiguating information, driven by uncalibrated metacognition, became increasingly ineffective as individuals are drawn in by the ambiguity of the news. Our results underscore the importance of metacognitive abilities in mediating the relationship between assessing ambiguous information and the decision to seek or avoid more information.
Breastfeeding is a complex task that requires proficiency at several key developmental skills to feed successfully. It is unclear how Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects an infant’s breastfeeding experience and conflicting reports exist on shortened breastfeeding duration in infants later diagnosed with ASD. The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of mothers breastfeeding both their autistic and neurotypical children to better understand the differences in their breastfeeding experiences and maternal and infant factors that contributed to breastfeeding cessation in their autistic child. Twenty-four mothers of an autistic child who had feeding difficulties in the first 12 months of life, initiated breastfeeding, and also had a neurotypical child participated in semi-structured interviews regarding breastfeeding initiation, cessation, and challenges encountered during breastfeeding. Analysis revealed four major themes: (1) the struggle with latch, including infant behavior that hindered latching; (2) breastfeeding challenges, including problematic breastfeeding behavior by the infant; (3) cessation of breastfeeding, including physical symptoms of the infant that lead to breastfeeding cessation; and (4) breastfeeding the neurotypical sibling, including mother’s detection of different breastfeeding behaviors in neurotypical and autistic child. Breastfeeding behaviors described by mothers may indicate early signs of autism including early sensory sensitivity, lack of regulation, repetitive behaviors, and impaired social behaviors. Further research is needed to discern if these breastfeeding behaviors can be used to help identify early signs of autism and employed as additional surveillance for neurodevelopmental concerns at a young age.
Previous literature has suggested a significant association between loneliness and depression. Importantly, research has shown that rumination can modulate the loneliness–depression relationship. However, most studies only treated loneliness, rumination or depression as unitary constructs. Considering the heterogeneity of the three concepts, we examined the relationship between specific loneliness, rumination items and depressive symptoms using the network analysis approach. In a large community adult sample (N= 900), we constructed the loneliness–depression and loneliness–rumination–depression network using a cross-sectional design. The results suggested that loneliness has no robust association with depressive symptoms. Instead, a connection between a specific ruminative thought (‘think about how alone you are’) and a specific loneliness item (‘how often do you feel alone’) is essential in maintaining the loneliness–rumination–depression network (partialr= 0.307). Our findings indicate that ruminating on the feeling of loneliness is the key underlying factor modulating the loneliness–depression relationship. Interventions for depression should focus on ameliorating ruminative thoughts, especially on loneliness feelings.
IntroductionLGBTQ+ refugees are likely to experience heightened mental health burdens and lower levels of well-being when compared to LGBTQ+ individuals without refugee experience. Still, the distinctive psychological mechanisms explaining their heightened levels of distress remain understudied. We examined the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ+ refugees in comparison to LGBTQ+ host country individuals in Germany and explored whether disparities are potentially mediated by proximal and distal minority stress.MethodsIn 2019, LGBTQ+ refugees (n1= 139) and LGBTQ+ Germans (n2= 262) participated in a cross-sectional online survey. Using path analysis, we compared mental health burdens (symptoms of depression/anxiety, post-traumatic stress) and well-being (life satisfaction, self-esteem) to understand how these variables are mediated by proximal (internalized homophobia, heightened vigilance) and distal minority stress (experiences of discrimination).ResultsLGBTQ+ refugees reported higher mental health burdens and lower life satisfaction yet no differences in self-esteem. Distal minority stress (discrimination) mediated the link between LGBTQ+ refugee status and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Proximal minority stress mediated both heightened symptoms of depression/anxiety and lower well-being for LGBTQ+ refugees.ConclusionsLinked to experiences of minority stress, LGBTQ+ refugees in Germany might be at a heightened risk for increased mental health burdens and lower well-being. Compared to host-country LGBTQ+ communities, LGBTQ+ refugees might experience different profiles of minority stress, including more distal minority stress.Policy ImplicationsBoth administrators and the local LGBTQ+ community need to be aware of the particular vulnerability and needs of LGBTQ+ refugees for protection and safety (e.g., housing) and the prevention of exploitation.
This study examined the extent to which state resident IQ, socioeconomic status (SES), and five racial-ethnic composition variables can independently account for differences in violent crime rates across the 48 contiguous American states using correlation and multiple regression strategies focused on 2019. Pearson correlations indicated that state violent crime rates significantly correlated − .69 with IQ, − .54 with SES, .39 with a racial-ethnic diversity composite, − .52 with White population percent, .30 with Black population percent, and .39 with Hispanic population percent. One set of five sequential multiple regression equations indicated that a state racial-ethnic diversity composite, White population percent, and Black population percent, still were significant predictors of state violent crime rates with socioeconomic status controlled. A second set of five equations showed none of the five racial-ethnic variables was a significant predictor of crime rates with IQ controlled. A third set of five equations showed that neither SES nor any of the racial-ethnic variables was a significant predictor with IQ controlled, and that IQ remained a significant predictor with SES and each of the five racial-ethnic variables in turn controlled. The findings persisted with multicollinearity and spatial autocorrelation considered. The results demonstrate the large and predominant negative relation of state resident IQ to state violent crime rates and its capacity to eliminate the relations of SES and racial-ethnic variables to those crime rates. Generally, the results underline the importance of evaluating potential crime rate predictors in a multiple regression model rather than testing their predictive capacities only as single variables.
Prior studies indicate that emotions, particularly high-arousal emotions, may elicit rapid intuitive thinking, thereby decreasing the ability to recognize misinformation. Yet, few studies have distinguished prior affective states from emotional reactions to false news, which could influence belief in falsehoods in different ways. Extending a study by Martel et al. (Cognit Res: Principles Implic 5: 1–20, 2020), we conducted a pre-registered online survey experiment in Austria (N = 422), investigating associations of emotions and discernment of false and real news related to COVID-19. We found no associations of prior affective state with discernment, but observed higher anger and less joy in response to false compared to real news. Exploratory analyses, including automated analyses of open-ended text responses, suggested that anger arose for different reasons in different people depending on their prior beliefs. In our educated and left-leaning sample, higher anger was often related to recognizing the misinformation as such, rather than accepting the false claims. We conclude that studies need to distinguish between prior affective state and emotional response to misinformation and consider individuals’ prior beliefs as determinants of emotions.
BackgroundNowadays, contemporary society has placed growing emphasis on the alcohol drinking behavior of college students.MethodsThis study employed a cross-sectional design to assess the relationship between upward social comparison (USC) on network and college students drinking behavior, while exploring the mediation impact of relative deprivation (RD) and anxiety. A total of 329 college students (Mage = 21.37 years old; 16.11% women) were enrolled to complete a set of questionnaires evaluating USC on network, RD, anxiety and alcohol dependence.ResultsThe results showed that (1) USC on network, RD, anxiety and alcohol dependence were significantly, positively correlated in pairs, and (2) RD and anxiety exhibited a significant chain mediating role between USC on network and alcohol dependence, and USC on network positively predicted alcohol dependence via the mediating effect of anxiety.ConclusionsThis study reveals that USC on network positively predicts alcohol dependence via the mediating effect of anxiety, and that RD and anxiety play a chain-mediating role between USC on network and alcohol dependence.
Psychological need crafting denotes individuals’ pro-active attempts to fulfill their psychological need for autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Although previous research has shown that need crafting contributes to adolescents’ mental health, little is known about the factors involved in adolescents’ daily efforts to engage in need crafting. This study considers psychological energy as both an important prerequisite for need crafting and as an outcome of daily need crafting. The sample consisted of 168 adolescents, aged 16–18 years (Mage= 16.63; 76.1% female). Morning and evening measurements were completed for 7 consecutive days. Adolescents’ need crafting intentions in the morning were associated positively with vitality at the end of the day, an effect occurring through satisfaction of the basic psychological needs. Further, better sleep and subsequent morning vitality predicted more need crafting intentions in the morning. The findings indicate that both a psychological pathway (i.e., need crafting) and physical pathway (i.e., sleep) are critical to preserve adolescents’ daily vitality.
In the field of psychological science, behavioral performance in computer-based cognitive tasks often exhibits poor reliability. The absence of reliable measures of cognitive processes contributes to non-reproducibility in the field and impedes the investigation of individual differences. Specifically in visual search paradigms, response time-based measures have shown poor test–retest reliability and internal consistency across attention capture and distractor suppression, but one study has demonstrated the potential for oculomotor measures to exhibit superior reliability. Therefore, in this study, we investigated three datasets to compare the reliability of learning-dependent distractor suppression measured via distractor fixations (oculomotor capture) and latency to fixate the target (fixation times). Our findings reveal superior split-half reliability of oculomotor capture compared to that of fixation times regardless of the critical distractor comparison, with the reliability of oculomotor capture in most cases falling within the range that is acceptable for the investigation of individual differences. We additionally find that older adults have superior oculomotor reliability compared with young adults, potentially addressing a significant limitation in the aging literature of high variability in response time measures due to slower responses. Our findings highlight the utility of measuring eye movements in the pursuit of reliable indicators of distractor processing and the need to further test and develop additional measures in other sensory domains to maximize statistical power, reliability, and reproducibility.
Understanding children of incarcerated parents frequently reflects a myopic focus on risk, disadvantage, and likelihood of intergenerational justice system involvement. Thankfully, we now see pivots towards using positive research frameworks to research youth and evaluate programming. One such initiative was undertaken by a Christian non-profit called Prison Fellowship® to develop their new program, theFirst Chance Network™. The program aims to promote family resilience and youth flourishing for families of children with incarcerated parents. A participatory, sequential mixed-methods evaluation design strategy was developed, taking inspiration from the Healthy Outcomes from Positive Experience (HOPE) framework, and Positive Childhood Experience (PCE) research. Initial findings from baseline surveys support the importance of PCEs, mentors, and supportive peers in promoting child well-being, even amongst adversity. Positive research strategies serve not only to evaluate programs and promote youth flourishing but also to redirect the defeatist narrative we often speak over children and families impacted by this adversity.
BackgroundDepression among high school students is a public health concern in Ethiopia. Studies have indicated that estimates of the prevalence of depression and its predicting factors among high school students are inconsistent. A systematic review and meta-analysis are essential to determine the pooled prevalence of depression and associated factors among high school students to help health care managers design appropriate interventions.MethodsA wide-ranging search was used in international databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Advanced Google. Observational studies (with cross-sectional study designs and case‒control, cohort and longitudinal studies) that reported the proportion of depression and associated factors in Ethiopia were included. In this study, unpublished and published primary studies were included. Two reviewers autonomously extracted all essential data elements using the Microsoft Excel worksheet and transferred them to Stata V.18 for analysis. The I2statistic test was determine the presence of heterogeneity among included studies and Egger’s regression test and funnel plot checked the publication bias.ResultsIn this review, a total of 10 primary studies with 6988 participants were included to estimate the combined prevalence. The pooled prevalence of depression among high school students in Ethiopia was 30% (26%, 34%). The subgroup analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of depression was higher in Tigray 35% (95% CI 33%, 38%) and a lower prevalence of depression was observed in Oromia 28% (95% CI 25%, 31%) and Amhara 28% (95% CI 18%, 37%). The results of the meta-analysis showed that being female (OR = 1.98; 95% CI 1.34, 2.61), alcohol use (OR = 2.59, 95% CI 1.64, 3.55), and parental neglect (OR = 2.64; 95% CI 1.86, 3.42) were significantly associated with depression among high school students in Ethiopia.ConclusionsIn this study, the overall pooled prevalence of depression among high school students in Ethiopia was high. Being female, alcohol use and parental neglect were potential factors associated with depression among high school students in Ethiopia. Therefore, it is important to pay special attention and design interventions to address depression among high school students in Ethiopia.PROSPERO registration number:CRD42024543877.
The article, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie (ZPS), deals with explanatory approaches and psychodramatic interventions in monodrama therapy concerning the treatment of mutism and separation anxiety in children, adolescents, and young adults. The focus lies on differentiations and similarities in hypothesis formation in the therapeutic support of these disorders. On one hand, the question of causes is addressed, and on the other hand, possible intervention guidelines are illuminated.
Sexual consent communication can be ambiguous when people rely on nonverbal, implicit cues. This ambiguity can lead to the reliance of contextual information to assess whether a sexual encounter was consensual, both in the moment and retrospectively. The current study examined how level of alcohol consumption, relationship type, and evaluator gender influenced the extent to which various sexual encounters were seen as consensual. Participants read a series of vignettes in which sexual consent was verbally granted, verbally rejected, or inferred using nonverbal cues. The vignettes also manipulated the amount of alcohol consumed by the target of the sexual advances (i.e., sober, tipsy, or intoxicated) as well as the relationship between the dyads (i.e., dating or strangers). Generally, male participants were more likely to interpret all encounters as more consensual. Encounters in which the target was intoxicated were more likely to be interpreted as nonconsensual, but instances when targets were described as tipsy (i.e., she consumed two or less alcoholic beverages) were seen as more consensual than sober encounters. The relationship between the dyads also influenced these perceptions. This work can inform educational efforts geared toward alcohol and sexual consent.
ObjectivesTo interview a series of individuals with bulimia nervosa of longstanding to establish their symptoms and examine the suggestion, using qualitative analysis, that the term “Severe and Enduring Bulimia Nervosa (SEED-BN)” might be appropriate and helpful.Methods12 participants with Bulimia Nervosa, one male, were interviewed with the help of an interview guide. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were analysed using Thematic Analysis.ResultsParticipants with Bulimia Nervosa described serious problems in many realms, especially social, psychological, family and relationships.ConclusionsBulimia nervosa of long duration is associated with many serious symptoms. It seems likely that recognition of long-standing bulimia nervosa as a severe and enduring eating disorder could encourage clinicians and families to pay attention to the wide variety of problems suffered by this group. Further research is required to examine this proposal.
Students in higher education often encounter significant academic pressure, which can have profound implications for their mental health and academic performance. The current study employs a two-wave longitudinal design to investigate the dynamic interrelationships among academic stress, academic motivation, emotional intelligence, and mindfulness. The study employed a cross-lagged panel model to investigate the temporal interactions among these four constructs and their influence on the academic experiences of doctoral students. The sample consisted of 643 individuals at Time 1 (September/October 2022), followed by a subsequent assessment involving 413 participants (July/August 2023). Notably, there was an overlap of 373 participants who were evaluated at both time points. The results indicated the presence of substantial reciprocal relationships among the constructs under investigation. The outcomes indicated that elevated emotional intelligence and mindfulness levels are associated with reduced academic stress and enhanced motivation. The implications of this analysis underscore the necessity of facilitating interventions aimed at enhancing emotional intelligence and mindfulness. These components are instrumental in promoting resilience and supporting academic success among students. These longitudinal insights hold significant importance within the academic literature as they elucidate the various stressors doctoral students encounter. Furthermore, this research provides practical implications for educators and policymakers in formulating targeted strategies to enhance student well-being and improve educational outcomes.
BackgroundAdolescent sleep disorders have emerged as a significant global public health issue. This study aims to investigate the relationship between physical activity and sleep disorders in adolescents, and to further analyze the chain mediating effects of anxiety and mobile phone dependence, with the goal of providing empirical evidence for related clinical research.MethodsThis cross-sectional study collected data through an offline questionnaire survey conducted in 2024. The survey assessed physical activity, sleep disorders, anxiety, and mobile phone dependence. Descriptive statistics and correlation analyses were utilized to construct a chain mediation model.ResultsA total of 495 valid samples were obtained, with 227 girls (45.9%) and 268 boys (54.1%). The average age of the participants was 13.37 years (SD = 1.05). The results indicated significant negative correlations between physical activity and adolescent anxiety, mobile phone dependence, and sleep disorders. Anxiety and mobile phone dependence fully mediated the relationship between physical activity and sleep disorders.ConclusionThis study provides further insight into the underlying mechanisms linking physical activity and sleep disorders in adolescents. Physical activity not only has a direct negative effect on sleep disorders but also indirectly predicts sleep disorders through its impact on anxiety and mobile phone dependence. It is recommended that families and schools encourage increased physical activity among adolescents, as it can reduce anxiety and mobile phone dependence, thereby alleviating sleep disorders.
BackgroundIn today’s rapidly evolving educational landscape, AI-powered applications like ChatGPT, POE, and Duolingo are revolutionizing language education, offering personalized learning experiences in EFL. However, challenges such as student engagement and academic procrastination persist. This study delves into how these AI tools impact EFL learners’ engagement and procrastination tendencies, aiming to inform effective technology integration in language instruction.ObjectivesThe primary goals of this research are to assess the influence of AI-empowered applications on affective, cognitive, and behavioural engagement and academic procrastination among EFL learners. By considering both the affective and cognitive aspects of engagement, the study aims to provide insights into optimizing EFL instruction through AI-driven tools while addressing academic procrastination challenges.MethodologyA quasi-experimental research method was employed, involving ten intact classes comprising 350 students divided into two groups. Engagement and procrastination scales were administered before and after the treatment. T-tests were utilized to analyze the data, comparing pre- and post-treatment scores between the groups.FindingsThe results indicate that the experimental group, exposed to AI-empowered applications, demonstrated significantly higher levels of affective, cognitive, and behavioural engagement than the control group. Keywords: AI-empowered applications, Academic procrastination, engagement, Chinese EFL learners’ engagement. Moreover, a substantial reduction in academic procrastination was observed among students exposed to AI-empowered applications.ConclusionsThe study underscores the potential of AI-empowered applications to enhance learner engagement and mitigate academic procrastination. The findings contribute to the pedagogical discourse surrounding technology integration and advocate adopting learner-centred approaches. The incorporation of AI-empowered applications in diverse educational settings is recommended.
BackgroundProfiling or clustering individuals based on personality and other characteristics is a common statistical approach used in marketing, medicine, and social sciences. This approach improves data simplicity, supports the implementation of a data-driven decision-making process, and guides intervention strategies, such as personalized care. However, the clustering process involves loss of information owing to the discretization of continuous variables. Although any loss of information may be practically or pragmatically acceptable, the amount of information lost and its influence on predicting external outcomes have not yet been systematically investigated.MethodsWe assessed the accuracy of predicting physical activity using the clustering approach and compared it with the dimensional approach, where variables are used as continuous regressors. This analysis is based on survey data from a sample of 20,573 individuals regarding physical activity and psychological traits, including the Big-Five personality traits.ResultsA four-cluster solution, supported by the standard criterion for determining the number of clusters, achieved no more than 60–70% prediction accuracy of the dimensional approach employing the raw dimensional scale as explanatory variables.ConclusionThe cluster solution suggested by conventional statistical criteria may not be optimal when clusters are used to predict external outcomes.
BackgroundThis study aims to investigate the impact of a leader’s beliefs in the usefulness of emotions on the emotional competence and relationship conflicts of their teams.MethodsThe data were collected through an online survey targeting leaders with at least three years of experience in managerial positions in South Korean workplaces, with a total of 326 participants. Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was conducted to classify leaders into latent groups based on their beliefs regarding the usefulness of positive and negative emotions.ResultsThe latent profile analysis of the leader’s beliefs in the usefulness of positive and negative emotions identified four groups: High Usefulness (HU) Group, High Positive Usefulness (HPU) Group, Reference Group for comparison, and Low Usefulness (LU) Group. It was found that both the HU Group and the HPU Group, who perceive the usefulness of both types of emotions and positive emotions, respectively, showed higher levels of emotional repair and lower levels of relationship conflict within the team compared to the Reference Group and the LU Group.ConclusionsThis study not only fills a gap in organizational research by establishing a clear link between leaders’ emotional beliefs and team dynamics but also emphasizes the social influence of leaders’ emotions within the team setting. The findings of this research advocate for a strategic update to leadership development programs, suggesting the integration of elements specifically designed to augment leaders’ understanding and management of emotional dynamics within their teams.
ObjectiveBy comparing the differences in pre-competition state anxiety, inter-competition heart rate variability (HRV), and shooting performance of young athletes of different grades, and revealing the correlation between these variables, it provides a potential basis for improving athletes’ shooting performance.MethodsA total of 45 adolescent shooters were selected in Chongqing, China, and completed 40 effective shots at self-pace in real shooting scenes. The pre-competition state anxiety, inter-competition HRV, and shooting performance of the athletes were monitored and evaluated respectively.Results(1) There was a significant difference in the pre-match state anxiety of the adolescent shooters, which showed that the cognitive state anxiety and physical state anxiety of the first-level athletes were significantly lower than those of the second-level athletes, while the state confidence was significantly higher than that of the second-level athletes. (2) There were significant differences in HRV of athletes with different sports levels during the competition, showing that the root mean square differences of the standard deviation (RMSSD), total power (TP), and high-frequency of normal (HFn) of the first-level athletes were significantly higher than those of second-level athletes, while low-frequency of normal (LFn) was significantly lower than the latter. (3) The shooting performance of first-level athletes was significantly better than that of second-level athletes. (4) Among adolescent shooters of different grades, there was a significant correlation between pre-competition state anxiety, inter-competition HRV, and shooting performance. The negative dimension of state anxiety was positively correlated with sympathetic activity in HRV, negatively correlated with parasympathetic activity, and negatively correlated with shooting performance. The positive dimension of state anxiety was negatively correlated with sympathetic activity in HRV, positively correlated with parasympathetic activity, and significantly positively correlated with motor performance.ConclusionAdolescent shooters with higher sports levels usually have better pre-competition mental state and emotional regulation ability, and could better maintain autonomic nerve dynamic balance and focus attention resources on shooting tasks during the competition, so it was easier to achieve good shooting performance. Meanwhile, pre-competition state anxiety and HRV during competition could be used as objective indicators to monitor and evaluate the competitive state of young shooters.
BackgroundMobile-based screening interventions to detect and treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) at an early stage might be a promising approach for reducing its societal burden. In the present study, we will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of screening for MDD using a mobile-based screening protocol.MethodsThis study will be a three-arm, parallel randomized control trial (RCT) performed in a multi-ethnic population within the municipality of Rotterdam (the Netherlands). The trial includes two intervention groups that will be screened 4-weekly for MDD for 12 months using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and a control group who does not receive mobile-based screening for MDD. Participants in the one-test intervention arm will be referred for further diagnosis and treatment, if necessary, after a single positive test score for moderate-severe major depression symptoms (PHQ-9 > 10). Participants in the multiple-test intervention arm will only be referred after three consecutive positive test scores. 1786 eligible participants will be included in the RCT, with 446 and 447 in the one-test and multiple-test referral arms, respectively, and 893 in the control arm. Primary outcome is participants’ QoL after 12 months (EQ-5D-5L). Secondary outcomes include participants’ QoL after 24 months (EQ-5D-5L), evaluating the occurrence and severity of MDD symptoms (PHQ-9), intervention engagement, and identifying public mental health differences based on sociodemographic characteristics, including age, gender, ethnicity, financial situation, educational background, and living area. Long-term results of the RCT will be incorporated into a microsimulation model to determine the long-term benefits, harms, and costs of MDD screening.DiscussionThe information gained from examining the feasibility and (cost-) effectiveness of mobile-based screening for MDD could be of guidance for mental health policy implementations and support the introduction of mobile-based screening for MDD in the Netherlands and/or other nations.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov: NL84280.078.23,NCT05989412, August 8, 2024.
BackgroundThere are large and persistent social inequalities in children’s educational attainment, with children from more socioeconomically disadvantaged families consistently having lower attainment. Despite this being widely reported, the mechanisms underlying the association between socioeconomic disadvantage and educational attainment are not well understood. It is important to understand the potential mechanisms by which socioeconomic disadvantage may impede on educational outcomes, as this knowledge could then be used to help target possible interventions to improve educational outcomes for socioeconomically disadvantaged children. Children’s executive functions (including working memory and inhibition) and processing speed abilities may underlie these inequalities, however, the previous literature regarding this is limited. This study examined longitudinal mediating mechanisms between socioeconomic status (SES) and educational achievement, using a socioeconomically deprived and ethnically diverse cohort.MethodsData from the Born in Bradford longitudinal cohort study was analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (n= 4201; 28% White British, 56% Pakistani heritage, 16% Other; 54% Female). SES was measured before birth, executive functions and processing speed were measured in middle childhood (Mage=8.45 years), and educational achievement was obtained through educational records (Mage=10.85 years). All models adjusted for child gender, age, language ability, ethnicity, and mother immigration status.ResultsExecutive functions significantly mediated the association between SES and educational achievement (B = 0.109), whilst processing speed did not. Examination of executive function components revealed that working memory significantly mediated the associated between SES and educational achievement (B = 0.100), whilst inhibition did not. Working memory appeared to account for a large proportion (39%) of the total effect of SES on educational achievement.ConclusionsThese results, and the theoretical mechanisms linking working memory to educational achievement, both indicate the importance of finding ways to support children with working memory difficulties in the classroom. This is an important avenue for future research and may be useful for closing the socioeconomic gap in educational achievement.
BackgroundIn this study, the effects of individuals’ digital obesity and phubbing behaviors on their life satisfaction were investigated by latent profile analysis (LPA) method. LPA is a statistical technique used to identify unobserved subgroups within a population based on individuals’ responses to various observed variables.MethodsThe present study was conducted in a correlational cross-sectional descriptive design between November 2023- January 2024. Digital obesity scale, phubbing scale, life satisfaction scale were used in this study.ResultsAs a result of LPA, Class 1 (Low Digital Addicts) has the lowest arithmetic mean in all indicators. When life satisfaction was analyzed on the basis of the classes, it was found out that Class 2 (High Digital Addicts), which was collected in the group with high levels of digital obesity and phubbing, had lower life satisfaction. Considering the demographic levels of individuals according to class level, it was concluded that high digital addiction was more common among individuals with secondary and postgraduate education.ConclusionsIn the present study, two classes were found as a result of LPA. In the analysis, Class 1(Low Digital Addicts) was found to have the lowest arithmetic mean in all indicators. On the other hand, when life satisfaction was analyzed according to the classes, it was detected that Class 2 (High Digital Addicts) life satisfaction was lower in the group with high levels of digital obesity and phubbing. In the study, the life satisfaction of class 1, which is characterized as low digital addicts, was found to be higher. Longitudinal studies on digital addictions affecting life satisfaction are recommended.
BackgroundSocial and emotional learning (SEL) is crucial for developing skills such as emotional regulation, cooperation, and goal achievement. Deficits in these skills are linked to later academic and behavioral problems. While SEL interventions have been widely implemented internationally, few have been tested in early childhood settings in Japan, and their effectiveness remains unclear. In 2022, the Fun FRIENDS social and emotional learning program was introduced in class units for 4–5-year-olds attending kindergartens and children’s schools in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. Thus, this study examined the effectiveness of the Fun FRIENDS program in children aged 4–5 years in Japan.MethodsFun FRIENDS is based on a cognitive-behavioral approach designed to teach participants how to cope with anxiety and stress, and to develop resilience and confidence. The program consists of 10 weekly sessions of approximately 1 h each. The intervention group comprised 115 children from two facilities, while the control group comprised 93 children from three facilities. Intervention effectiveness was evaluated through changes in externalizing (e.g., aggression, oppositional behavior) and internalizing behaviors (e.g., anxiety, depression), measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Finally, data from 94 participants in the intervention group and 66 participants in the control group were analyzed.ResultsIn the intervention group, externalizing behaviors showed a significant reduction both before and after the intervention and internalizing behaviors also decreased significantly. Conversely, the control group did not exhibit any significant changes in either externalizing or internalizing behaviors before or after the intervention. The effect size for externalizing behaviors in the target group was 0.744, while the effect size for internalizing behaviors was 0.653.ConclusionsSocial and emotional learning programs in classrooms may effectively control problem behaviors in early childhood and prevent school maladjustment. A whole-class approach can reach more children, maximizing the preventive effects. The program can improve academic performance and social adaptation, contributing to the long-term development of psychological health and social skills. Nevertheless, further longitudinal research is required to assess the program’s long-term effects. In summary, strengthening the focus on social-emotional learning in early childhood education policy is key to realizing long-term benefits for child development.
BackgroundNowadays, contemporary society has placed growing emphasis on the alcohol drinking behavior of college students.MethodsThis study employed a cross-sectional design to assess the relationship between upward social comparison (USC) on network and college students drinking behavior, while exploring the mediation impact of relative deprivation (RD) and anxiety. A total of 329 college students (Mage = 21.37 years old; 16.11% women) were enrolled to complete a set of questionnaires evaluating USC on network, RD, anxiety and alcohol dependence.ResultsThe results showed that (1) USC on network, RD, anxiety and alcohol dependence were significantly, positively correlated in pairs, and (2) RD and anxiety exhibited a significant chain mediating role between USC on network and alcohol dependence, and USC on network positively predicted alcohol dependence via the mediating effect of anxiety.ConclusionsThis study reveals that USC on network positively predicts alcohol dependence via the mediating effect of anxiety, and that RD and anxiety play a chain-mediating role between USC on network and alcohol dependence.
Research has developed the Big-Five Aspect Scale (BFAS), supporting a five-domain model that includes 10 related aspects. In Arabic societies, there is currently a lack of validation evidence for a scale with these 10 aspects. Thus, this study develops and examines the psychometric properties of the short version of the BFAS (BFAS-SV) within Libyan Arab adults. The sample (N= 1136; 74.6% women, Mage = 25.30, SDage = 8.44) completed the original BFAS and the Arabic version of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) to assess the BFAS-SV’s convergent validity. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was applied. The findings provide strong support for the presence of 10 distinct aspects within the Big Five personality domains. Additionally, a robust positive and negative correlation was found among the 10 BFAS-SV aspects, as well as between the BFAS-SV domains of Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Introversion, and Openness/Intellect and their corresponding dimensions in the IPIP, further confirming its concurrent and discriminant validity. Furthermore, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for the five domains and their respective 10 aspects ranged from 0.61 to 0.85, indicating good internal consistency. Significant gender differences were observed in the Neuroticism domain, particularly in its two aspects (Volatility and Withdrawal), as well as in the Openness/Intellect domain and the Politeness aspect, with women scoring higher in all cases.In conclusion, this study establishes the reliability, validity, and applicability of the Arabic BFAS among the Libyan Arab population. The insights gained into the personality traits and behaviors of Libyan Arab individuals provide valuable implications for personal development and professional success.
Students in higher education often encounter significant academic pressure, which can have profound implications for their mental health and academic performance. The current study employs a two-wave longitudinal design to investigate the dynamic interrelationships among academic stress, academic motivation, emotional intelligence, and mindfulness. The study employed a cross-lagged panel model to investigate the temporal interactions among these four constructs and their influence on the academic experiences of doctoral students. The sample consisted of 643 individuals at Time 1 (September/October 2022), followed by a subsequent assessment involving 413 participants (July/August 2023). Notably, there was an overlap of 373 participants who were evaluated at both time points. The results indicated the presence of substantial reciprocal relationships among the constructs under investigation. The outcomes indicated that elevated emotional intelligence and mindfulness levels are associated with reduced academic stress and enhanced motivation. The implications of this analysis underscore the necessity of facilitating interventions aimed at enhancing emotional intelligence and mindfulness. These components are instrumental in promoting resilience and supporting academic success among students. These longitudinal insights hold significant importance within the academic literature as they elucidate the various stressors doctoral students encounter. Furthermore, this research provides practical implications for educators and policymakers in formulating targeted strategies to enhance student well-being and improve educational outcomes.
ObjectiveAt present there is no clear, cohesive, and comprehensive theoretical understanding of the role of core beliefs in the development of disordered eating. The present study aimed to develop and test a theoretical model outlining important processes and pathways from core beliefs to eating disorder (ED) behaviours. It also aimed to explore potential differences (or similarities) in contributions of four core belief dimensions to the development and maintenance of ED symptomatology.MethodData were collected from a sample of 800 non-clinical participants. Path analysis was conducted to test general and multi-dimensional models. Indirect effects were calculated for all possible pathways from ED core beliefs to dietary restraint, objective binge eating, and compensatory behaviours.ResultsThe hypothesised model demonstrated poor to acceptable fit to the data. Modifications were made to the general model to improve fit, remove non-significant paths and add theoretically and statistically relevant paths. All indirect effects of possible pathways from core beliefs to ED behaviours were significant. A multi-dimensional version of the model was tested with four core belief dimensions. This model identified differences in pathways from each core belief dimension to ED symptoms.DiscussionThis study extends the current understanding of the role of core beliefs in the development and maintenance of disordered eating, by building upon previous theoretical models and empirical literature. We present a general core beliefs model of disordered eating, and preliminary findings regarding differences in the processes and pathways from four key core belief dimensions to ED behaviours.
BackgroundThis study examined the latent factor structures and psychometric properties of three brief versions of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)—DERS-SF, DERS-18, and DERS-16—across large-scale samples of the Korean population.MethodsParticipants from two independent community samples (N= 862 andN= 1,242) completed an online self-report survey, including brief versions of the DERS and associated measures. Confirmatory factor analyses were employed to examine the latent factor structures of the brief versions of the DERS with comparable models. The internal consistency, concurrent validity, and convergent validity of the brief versions of the DERS were also assessed.ResultsThe findings revealed that the bifactor models of the DERS-SF and DERS-18, excluding the Awareness subscale, showed superior fit indices for latent factor structure and favorable reliability. By contrast, the DERS-16 exhibited inadequate fit. Scores from the DERS-SF and DERS-18 demonstrated significant associations with indicators of psychological distress, supporting their convergent validity. The Awareness subscale showed lower internal consistency and distinctive correlation patterns with clinical outcomes.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the robustness of the DERS-SF and DERS-18 as parsimonious and efficient measures of emotion dysregulation with fewer items than the original version. Furthermore, this study provides additional support for excluding the Awareness subscale when using the brief versions of the DERS.
BackgroundAfter a literature review and interviews with patients living with obesity, key psychosocial determinants such as coping strategies, weight bias internalization, body dissatisfaction and self-efficacy were identified as critical to address obesity-related stigma. The intervention was tailored using evidence-based techniques and input from health professionals to ensure relevance and avoid redundancy. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the effect of an intervention specifically designed to address weight stigma among individuals living with obesity.MethodsThe study compares two parallel arms following different interventions: Patient Education as Usual (PEU) program and the newly developed Patient Education STEREOBES (PES) program, which integrates additional components to counteract weight stigma. The PES program, crafted using the Intervention Mapping process, addresses key psychosocial determinants such as self-efficacy, body image, and coping strategies. It incorporates workshops focused on psychoeducation, physical activity, and emotional regulation through innovative techniques like mindfulness, assertiveness training, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The program emphasizes group activities and patient interaction to foster resilience against stigmatizing experiences and promote healthier lifestyle choices. This comprehensive intervention is designed to improve psychological, behavioral, and physical outcomes, particularly by reducing the internalization of weight bias and enhancing coping mechanisms.DiscussionPatients in the PES arm should demonstrate significant improvements in quality of life and self-efficacy compared to the PEU arm. Psychosocial factors should mediate the effect of the intervention on the outcomes involving quality of life and behaviors. This study will provide valuable insights into the role of weight stigma in obesity treatment and the effectiveness of targeted interventions.Trial registrationThis research protocol has been approved by the Individual Protection Committee Northwest IV (National n°2023-A00327-38) and registered on Clinicaltrial.gov (NCT05906238) on June 7, 2023.
Throughout life, individuals encounter many different upsetting events. The concepts of psychological resilience and mindfulness come to the fore in the situations encountered. The dynamics of these concepts and the extent to which they are related to loneliness and problematic TikTok use demonstrate the importance of the research. The aim of this study was to test the mediating role of problematic TikTok use and loneliness in the relationship between mindfulness and psychological resilience in adolescents. In the study, Mindfulness Scale, UCLA Loneliness Scale, Brief Psychological Resilience Scale, and Problematic TikTok Use Scale were administered to 354 students (236 girls and 118 boys) with an average age of 14.7 years who were studying in different high schools in Turkey. The data were tested using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and structural equation modeling analyses. The results of the study showed that problematic TikTok use and loneliness had a partial mediating role in the relationship between mindfulness and psychological resilience in adolescents. In the model with serial mediation, it was concluded that individuals with high levels of mindfulness had low levels of loneliness and problematic TikTok use and high levels of psychological resilience. Mindfulness predicts psychological resilience directly and indirectly through problematic TikTok use and loneliness. This situation can be interpreted as the impairment of psychological resilience, the level of mindfulness can be impaired by TikTok use and individuals can become lonely. This result was discussed in the light of theoretical and empirical data.
BackgroundThe transition to motherhood involves significant changes, extending from pregnancy to the early years of a child's life. This period, characterized by multiple stressors and adjustments, can profoundly impact maternal well-being. For this reason, the aim of this study was to investigate the associations between work-family balance, need satisfaction, depression, anger, vitality and sleep–wake problems, using Self-determination Theory (SDT) as a theoretical framework.MethodsParticipated in this study 218 working mothers in Italy with children aged between 1 and 36 months. Using a correlational design, SEM with latent variables was used to test an integrative model.ResultsResults revealed significant positive associations between work-family balance and need satisfaction, and vitality, and negative direct associations of need satisfaction with sleep–wake problems, depression, and anger. Indirect associations were also visible between work-family balance and psychological outcomes through need satisfaction.Conclusions.Overall, findings underscore the importance of conditions that support the satisfaction autonomy, competence, and relatedness of working mothers during this critical life stage. These insights have implications for organizational policies and interventions aimed at supporting the mental health of working mothers.
ObjectiveTo investigate the effects of depression on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and related psychological conditions in adolescents with unipolar disorder (UD) and bipolar disorder (BD), and to provide a basis for accurate prevention and intervention of NSSI behaviors in adolescents.MethodsThis cross-sectional study collected data from adolescents aged 12–18 years with depressive episodes who exhibited NSSI behaviors and attended the psychiatric outpatient clinic of Huangshi City Psychiatric Specialized Hospital from 2018 to 2023. Depressive episodes were clinically diagnosed by two psychiatrists according to the ICD-10.ResultsIn terms of NSSI behavioral patterns and severity, adolescents with UD displayed more frequent behaviour of intentionally burning themselves with cigarettes and had more instances of self-inflicted suicidal thoughts that were not carried out compared to those with BD, and the differences between the two groups were statistically significant (P< 0.05). For psychological status, Nurses′ Global Assessment of Suicide Risk (NGASR) scores were significantly higher in adolescents with BD than in those with UD (P< 0.05). There was a significant negative correlation between anxiety scores and the frequency of NSSI in adolescents with BD (P< 0.05); that is, the more anxious the adolescents with BD, the lower the frequency of NSSI. The NGASR scores of adolescents with UD and BD were significantly and positively correlated with the frequency of NSSI occurrences (P< 0.05); higher NGASR scores of adolescents with UD and BD corresponded with higher frequencies of NSSI.ConclusionThe differences in NSSI behaviors between adolescents with UD and those with BD were statistically significant in terms of self-injury method and severity. Adolescents with UD experienced more severe consequences related to NSSI behaviors. Regarding psychological conditions, adolescents with BD are at a higher risk of suicide. An inverse relationship was observed between anxiety severity and the frequency of NSSI in adolescents with BD; severe anxiety was associated with lower NSSI frequency. Additionally, higher suicide risk was associated with a higher frequency of NSSI in adolescent patients with either UD or BD. Therefore, different prevention and intervention measures are needed to address NSSI behaviors in adolescents with UD and BD.
Considering the growing interest in VR psychotherapy, this study investigated the relationship between client laughter and session outcomes in metaverse counseling. To investigate the relationships between types of client laughter and session outcomes in metaverse counseling, we employed a multilevel analysis by separating the variables into two levels: session-level (between-sessions) and client-level (between-clients). The dataset included 159 sessions nested among 26 clients. This study found that clients’ cheerful and nervous laughter positively impacted session outcomes at the session level (within individual clients). However, when considering client-level laughter events (between-client), nervous laughter at the session level was not significantly related to session outcomes. Polite, reflective, and contemptuous laughter showed no significant relationship with the session outcomes. None of the laughter events were related to session outcomes at the client level (between clients). However, there was a significant within-level interaction effect between session and cheerful laughter on session outcomes. The implications of the effects of client laughter are discussed in metaverse counseling by comparing them with those of in-person counseling.
ObjectiveThis study aims to explore electronic health literacy’s impact on college students’ emotional management ability and analyze the chained mediating effects of peer relationships and exercise self-efficacy.MethodsThe study used stratified, cluster, and staged sampling methods to collect demographic information. Electronic health literacy, peer relationships, exercise self-efficacy, and emotional management ability data were collected among college students using the Questionnaire Star software. A total of 30,105 valid questionnaires were obtained, with a valid response rate of 98.7%. Using Process Model 6, investigated how electronic health literacy sequentially influences emotional management ability through mediators such as peer relationships and exercise self-efficacy.ResultsThere was a significant positive correlation between electronic health literacy and emotional management ability (r= 0.496,P< 0.01), between electronic health literacy and peer relationships (r= 0.226,P< 0.01), and between electronic health literacy and exercise self-efficacy (r= 0.180,P< 0.01). Peer relationships were significantly positively correlated with exercise self-efficacy (r= 0.142,P< 0.01) and emotional management ability (r= 0.396,P< 0.01). Exercise self-efficacy was significantly positively correlated with emotional management ability (r= 0.339,P< 0.01). Electronic health literacy significantly and positively predicted emotional management ability (β = 0.254,P< 0.001). There was a mediating effect of peer relationships between electronic health literacy and emotional management ability, accounting for 58.2% of the impact, 95%CI: [0.036,0.042]. Exercise self-efficacy also mediated the relationship between electronic health literacy and emotional management ability, accounting for 61.5% of the effect, 95%CI: [0.022,0.027]. Moreover, a chained mediating effect of peer relationships and exercise self-efficacy was observed between electronic health literacy and emotional management ability, accounting for 17.1% of the effect, 95%CI: [0.004,0.005].ConclusionElectronic health literacy among college students can positively predict emotional management ability. Both peer relationships and exercise self-efficacy play a chained mediating role between electronic health literacy and emotional management ability.
BackgroundMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. MS causes many changes in the lives of its patients, forcing them to renegotiate their lives. Part of these changes are related to patients’ self- and others- mental representations. Despite the importance of mental representations in changes caused by or adaptation to MS, limited research has been conducted to examine the mental representations of people with MS.MethodsThis study examines the mental representations that Healthy Controls (HC) and people with MS (PWMS) have of themselves and others, including childhood and current self-images, as well as those of their mothers, love partners, and close friends. In both groups (HC (n= 82) and PWMS (n= 82)), participants completed demographic variables as well as a modified version of the comfortable interpersonal distance (CID) task in both passive (when protagonists approached them) and active modes (when participants approach protagonists). Participants estimated the point at which they felt discomforted.ResultsThe PWMS group preferred a significantly larger interpersonal distance than the HC group for both current self-image and love partner. There is no difference between the two groups in preferring interpersonal distance from their childhood self-image, mother, and friends.ConclusionsBased on the research results, it seems that PWMS experience a kind of alienation at the level of self-mental representations. This research can be helpful in modifying MS interventions and increasing the engagement of support systems.
This article develops a comprehensive database comprising 5956 German affective norms specifically tailored for the study of organizational atmospheres through computational verbal language analysis. This dictionary adopts both dimensional and categorical approaches. The theoretical foundation of this study is the circumplex model of affective atmospheres. Similar to established methodologies, each word is rated based on the dimensions of valence and arousal. Going beyond the dimensional approach, this article introduces a classification system with 11 distinct atmospheric categories, assigning the words to their corresponding categories. This dictionary represents the first attempt to apply computer-aided text analysis (CATA) to the study of organizational atmospheres, providing a practical tool to support research in this developing area.
BackgroundMississippi youth are demographically unique compared to that of the nation. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and trend of suicide ideation, suicide plans, suicidal attempts, and suicidal injury among high school students in Mississippi vs. in the United States (U.S.).MethodSummary statistics, prevalence ratio (PR), and trend analysis were generated and compared between Mississippi high school students and their U.S. counterparts.ResultsThe 2021 prevalences for suicide plans, suicide attempts, and suicide injury are all significantly higher for Mississippi high school students compared to their national counterparts. From 2001 to 2021, on the national level, none of the four suicide behaviors showed significant change, whereas, in Mississippi, suicide plans, suicide attempts, and suicide injury all had an increasing trend.ConclusionsOur study reveals alarming increasing trends and significantly greater severity of suicidal burdens among Mississippi high school students compared to the nation. Left unattended, these trends may continue quicker due to a clustering effect. There is an urgent need for Mississippi to implement more and better intervention and prevention measures to stop and reverse the increasing trend of suicidal behaviors among its 9–12 graders.
BackgroundInfertility affects men and women differently; however, there is a scarcity of studies focusing specifically on men’s perspectives. Given the importance of understanding men’s experiences in infertility treatment, this study aimed to explore the experiences of Iranian men facing infertility.MethodsA qualitative descriptive approach was employed, utilizing purposive sampling to recruit 12 Iranian men dealing with infertility. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Persian, the native language of the participants, to facilitate ease of communication and ensure the richness of data. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis, following Lincoln and Guba’s criteria for trustworthiness to ensure rigor. The entire content of the interviews was transcribed in Persian and analyzed in the same language to maintain the original meaning of the participants’ expressions. After the analysis was completed, the manuscript, including the summarized findings, was translated into English. MAXQDA software version 0.9.5 was used for data management.ResultsThe findings were organized into five main themes: psychological, social, sexual, cultural, and coping dimensions. The study reveals that infertility profoundly impacts men’s psychological well-being, leading to reduced self-confidence and increased societal and familial pressures. Participants expressed feelings of inadequacy and challenges in sexual intimacy, exacerbated by cultural stigma. The social pressures included external societal expectations and dynamics within spousal relationships. Additionally, cultural beliefs significantly influence men’s experiences of infertility, affecting their mental health and treatment choices. Coping strategies such as acceptance, faith, and optimism are crucial in helping men navigate these challenges.ConclusionOverall, the results highlight the need for comprehensive support addressing the psychological, social, sexual, and cultural dimensions of infertility. This study underscores the importance of tailored interventions that consider the unique experiences of men facing infertility, emphasizing the role of coping strategies and the influence of cultural factors on mental health and treatment decisions. By fostering an understanding of these complexities, healthcare providers can better assist men in navigating the challenges of infertility.
The examination of transgenerational transmission, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie (ZPS), has garnered attention in psychogenealogy and, more recently, in epigenetics, delving into the profound impact of ancestral lives on an individual’s self-perception, relationships, and overall well-being. The transgenerational approach in psychotherapy investigates the influence of unconscious familial inheritance, such as traumas, attitudes, illnesses, and loyalties. The Genosociogram, as a central diagnostic tool, visually represents the family history through the client’s lenses, revealing repetitive and maladaptive patterns. In a one-to-one context, the therapist collaborates with the client to explore family history and dynamics, utilizing psychodramatic techniques to illuminate these aspects. One-to-one transgenerational psychodrama, rooted in the classical group method, uses basic psychodrama techniques, but also employs tools from psychogenealogy and art expression to assist individuals in recognizing and addressing these issues. This collaborative process helps the client gain profound insights into their family system, shedding light on how transgenerational inheritance shaped their behaviors and choices, creating new paths for the future.
This study was designed to investigate the relationships between self-focused attention (SFA), other-focused attention (OFA), scanpath length, and fixation count during free speech tasks in the context of social anxiety and metacognitive beliefs. Thirty-nine participants undertook speech tasks while an advanced eye tracker traced each participant’s visual scanpath and fixation count. We performed multiple regression analyses using generalized linear models to dissect the influences of SFA and OFA under varying levels of social anxiety and metacognitive beliefs. Higher subjective SFA during speech tasks with higher social anxiety was linked solely to a short scanpath. In contrast, higher subjective OFA during speech tasks with higher social anxiety was tied exclusively to high fixation counts. Moreover, higher subjective SFA during speech tasks with more positive metacognitive beliefs about SFA was connected solely to a short scanpath, and more negative metacognitive beliefs about OFA were independently associated solely with high fixation counts. Our findings contribute to the field by illustrating a double dissociation between SFA and OFA in relation to scanpath length and fixation count, a relationship that has not been thoroughly examined with traditional fixation time measures. This study also provides preliminary insights into how specific metacognitive beliefs may influence the visual attention strategies of socially anxious individuals during speech tasks. These findings enhance our understanding of SFA and OFA and offer potential directions for further exploration into interventions for social anxiety disorders.
This longitudinal study investigated the predictive value of initial level and growth rate of joint attention and play from 10 to 24 months for language abilities of 24-month-old toddlers at elevated likelihood (EL) for autism. (Semi-)structured assessments were used to measure all variables at different timepoints prospectively in younger siblings of children with autism (siblings,n= 48) and children born before 30 gestational weeks (preterms,n= 49). A positive association was found between initial level of play at 10 months and expressive language at 24 months in siblings, but not in preterms. We did not find an association between initial level of play and receptive language. Growth rate of play and initial level and growth rate of joint attention were not related to language abilities in siblings and preterms. Our results indicate that play and expressive language are interrelated, and early play behaviour may contribute to later language. As this association was absent in preterms, they may follow qualitatively different developmental processes. Moreover, future research including different EL-groups is needed to clarify these differential associations. In contrast to previous studies, no association between early joint attention and later language was found. These inconsistent findings warrant further exploration and highlight the importance of exploring alternative aspects of early development, for instance non-social factors, to expand our understanding of language acquisition.
BackgroundWith societal development and increasing talent demands, college students face escalating pressures primarily stemming from academic burdens, uncertainties about the future, and complex social environments. These pressures have profound effects on mental health, particularly negatively impacting emotions and behavior. In this context, depressive symptoms are becoming increasingly prevalent among college students. Given the potential links between emotional disorders, anxiety, social pressure, and academic burnout, this study aims to explore how these factors collectively influence depression in college students.MethodsThis study utilized a questionnaire approach, resulting in 599 valid responses. The collected data were analyzed using Smart-PLS for SEM to investigate the relationships among the variables.ResultsThe SEM analysis indicated that the comprehensive model explained 83.2% of the variance in depression. Alexithymia significantly positively predicted anxiety and social pressure. Academic burnout significantly positively influenced social pressure, anxiety, and depression. Anxiety played a partial mediating role in the impact of alexithymia and academic burnout on depression. Social pressure and alexithymia did not have a significant positive impact on depression. In addition, there is a significant gender difference in the impact of academic burnout on depression, with the path coefficient for males being significantly higher than that for females.ConclusionThis study validated the complex relationships among alexithymia, anxiety, social pressure, academic burnout, and depression. As an emotional expression disorder, alexithymia not only directly impacts anxiety levels in college students but also indirectly affects depression through anxiety. Furthermore, the positive influence of academic burnout on anxiety and depression indicates that excessive academic burdens are significant sources of mental health issues for college students. This research offers new insights into understanding college students’ mental health issues, aiming to provide more comprehensive intervention strategies for their psychological well-being.
PurposeInclusive education plays a crucial role in integrating students with special educational needs (SEN) into mainstream schools, where the attitudes of pre-service teachers are pivotal. Despite recognizing the significance of these attitudes, there is currently a gap in understanding the perspectives of students attending normal universities in China regarding inclusive education practices. This study aims to bridge this gap by creating the Chinese version of the Normal Universities Students’ Attitudes Toward Inclusive Education Scale (NUSATIES) and examining its psychometric properties.MethodsIn the context of China, this study validated and assessed the reliability of the Chinese adaptation of the NUSATIES among a sample of 4,091 students from normal universities. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was employed to confirm the scale’s structural integrity, discriminant validity, and convergent validity. Additionally, Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability (CR) were used to evaluate the scale’s internal consistency and reliability.ResultsThe findings indicated that the Chinese version of the NUSATIES possessed robust validity and reliability, which comprises three factors (i.e., cognitive, affective, and behavioral intention). The findings revealed that normal university students’ attitudes significantly varied based on specialty; students specializing in special education exhibited more positive attitudes towards inclusive education than those in general education.ConclusionThese findings indicate that the scale is effective in measuring attitudes toward inclusive education in Chinese-speaking countries. This study significantly contributes to the field by emphasizing the importance of positive attitudes among normal university students in fostering inclusive education and by offering a validated tool for assessing these attitudes.
Considerable research has shown that people make biased decisions in “optimal stopping problems”, where options are encountered sequentially, and there is no opportunity to recall rejected options or to know upcoming options in advance (e.g. when flat hunting or choosing a spouse). Here, we used computational modelling to identify the mechanisms that best explain decision bias in the context of an especially realistic version of this problem: the full-information problem. We eliminated a number of factors as potential instigators of bias. Then, we examined sequence length and payoff scheme: two manipulations where an optimality model recommends adjusting the sampling rate. Here, participants were more reluctant to increase their sampling rates when it was optimal to do so, leading to increased undersampling bias. Our comparison of several computational models of bias demonstrates that many participants maintain these relatively low sampling rates because of suboptimally pessimistic expectations about the quality of future options (i.e. a mis-specified prior distribution). These results support a new theory about how humans solve full information problems. Understanding the causes of decision error could enhance how we conduct real world sequential searches for options, for example how online shopping or dating applications present options to users.
BackgroundSuicidal ideation among college students and adolescents represents a significant public health issue worldwide. Research has indicated that emotional difficulties may mediate the relationship between bullying victimization and suicidal ideation. However, insights from Thomas Joiner’s interpersonal theory and Klonsky’s The Three-Step Theory suggest that suicidal ideation arises not merely from emotional distress but from the interplay of hopelessness along with these emotional challenges. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether variouse affective problems mediated the relationship between bullying victimization and suicidal ideation among college students.MethodsIn this study, we utilized a convenience sampling method to collect data from 2717 college students (mean age = 19.81 years, 22.49% male) in South China. We examined the relationships between variables using Spearman’s correlation analysis. To analyze potential mediation effects, we employed PROCESS model 4 within SPSS.ResultsOur findings revealed that different forms of bullying victimization can predict experiences of depression, anxiety, and social anxiety. However, these emotional responses did not significantly influenced suicidal ideation among college students. Additionally, while different forms of bullying victimization did not directly correlate with feelings of hopelessness, hopelessness was closely associated with the prevalence of suicidal ideation. Furthermore, our results highlighted a significant mediating role of psychiatric prodromal experiences in the relationship between different forms of bullying victimization and suicidal ideation.ConclusionsThe results suggested that affective problems may not serve as a significant mediating factor in the relationship between bullying victimization and suicidal ideation. We proposed an integrated emotion-response model that enhances understanding of suicidal ideation among college and offers a framework for more effective prevention strategies.
The study of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-powered chatbots has gained significant attention in recent years, with researchers treating LLMs as participants in psychological experiments. To facilitate this research, we developed an R package called “MacBehaviour“, which interacts with over 100 LLMs, including OpenAI's GPT family, the Claude family, Gemini, Llama family, and other open-weight models. The package streamlines the processes of LLM behavioural experimentation by providing a comprehensive set of functions for experiment design, stimuli presentation, model behaviour manipulation, and logging responses and token probabilities. With a few lines of code, researchers can seamlessly set up and conduct psychological experiments, making LLM behaviour studies highly accessible. To validate the utility and effectiveness of “MacBehaviour,“ we conducted three experiments on GPT-3.5 Turbo, Llama-2-7b-chat-hf, and Vicuna-1.5-13b, replicating the sound-gender association in LLMs. The results consistently demonstrated that these LLMs exhibit human-like tendencies to infer gender from novel personal names based on their phonology, as previously shown by Cai et al. (2024). In conclusion, “MacBehaviour” is a user-friendly R package that simplifies and standardises the experimental process for machine behaviour studies, offering a valuable tool for researchers in this field.
BackgroundThe Chinese educational sector is dynamic; hence, there is a need to anchor the factors that influence faculty job satisfaction and performance. These are channeled through organizational climate (OrgC) and employee happiness (EmH). The growing integration of artificial intelligence applications (AIAs)—like ChatGPT—into the learning environment raises questions about AIAs’ moderating role in the relationship between EmH at work and EJoS.PurposeThis research empirically examines the influence of OrgC on EmH, the direct and mediated impacts of EmH on EJoS, and the moderating effect of AIAs on the influence of EmH on EJoS.Design/MethodologyData was collected from faculty members of various Chinese universities. Using SmartPLS version 4.1, I have analyzed six hypotheses and the corresponding research questions.FindingsThe outcomes include favorable effects of OrgC on EmH and EJoS. EmH significantly correlates with EJoS, partially mediating the relationship between OrgC and EJoS. Interestingly, the research did not find evidence that AIAs moderated the relationship (ChatGPT) between EmH and EJoS. The predictors (OrgC and EmH) and moderation of AIAs explained a 51.9% change in EJoS, and EJoS explained a 13.3% variance in employee job performance.ConclusionThis study’s findings support a supportive OrgC as the key instrument for improving employees’ happiness and job satisfaction. AI assistants, such as ChatGPT, provide relative efficiency and support but do not significantly affect how EmH at work relates to job satisfaction.
BackgroundPrevious research has shown that higher self-efficacy predicts lower cognitive load. Nevertheless, there is limited research exploring the dynamic calibration phenomenon of cognitive resources by self-efficacy during task execution through experimental methods.MethodsThis study elucidates the relationships and longitudinal mediating effects among self-efficacy, state anxiety, and cognitive load through two studies that employed convenience sampling. Study 1, which aims to provide a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the research question, is an interview study that examines the prevalence of fluctuations in self-efficacy among 22 university students through an in-depth interview. On the other hand, study 2 reveals further causal relationships through experimental methods. It adopts a 3 (repeated measures: first time, second time, third time) × 2 (conditions: feedback group, non-feedback group) mixed design by 86 participants, utilizing a false feedback paradigm to manipulate participants’ self-efficacy, with the task of the experiment being emotion recognition.ResultsThe results demonstrate that, compared to the non-feedback group, false feedback can successfully manipulate the self-efficacy of the participants, and the data from the feedback group further reveals the multilevel mediating role of state anxiety in the process of self-efficacy influencing cognitive load.ConclusionIn general, the findings from two studies suggest that the enhancement of college students’ self-efficacy during task execution can reduce their state anxiety, which in turn can further alleviate cognitive load.
BackgroundPatients undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) experience significant psychological distress due to infertility, with depression and anxiety being the most common manifestations. This study investigates the influence of family support and self-efficacy on the mental health of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). The aim is to assess the direct and indirect effects of family function and self-efficacy on depression and anxiety in IVF-ET patients through pathway analyses, thereby providing novel insights for improving patients’ psychological well-being.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted from March to July 2021, employing convenience sampling to recruit 291 participants from a tertiary care hospital’s reproductive medicine center. Data were collected using the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), Family APGAR index (APGAR), and a Demographic Characteristics Form. Descriptive analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis were performed. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) was utilized for pathway analysis to evaluate the direct and indirect influences of family function and self-efficacy on anxiety and depression.ResultsThe scores for the SAS and SDS were 46.15 ± 7.35 and 51.71 ± 8.65, respectively. Multiple regression analysis indicated that family function, self-efficacy, and economic status significantly predicted anxiety and depression. Path analysis revealed that economic status directly (β=-0.447, -0.232) and indirectly (β=-0.066, -0.068) affected anxiety and depression, while family function both directly and indirectly affected depression (β=-0.323, -0.104), directly affected anxiety (β=-0.351), and self-efficacy directly influenced only depression (β=-0.509).ConclusionThe findings underscore the pivotal role of a supportive family environment and self-efficacy in alleviating anxiety and depression among IVF-ET patients. The mediating role of family function between economic status and mental health highlights the importance of integrated support systems. Enhancing family function and self-efficacy as part of comprehensive care for individuals undergoing ART is crucial for promoting patient well-being.
Previous research has indicated that student mental health is linked to their engagement at school. However, there is a lack of empirical studies examining students’ school engagement from the more comprehensive dual-factor model, which assesses both psychopathology and subjective well-being [SWB]. The current study examined this relationship via an adolescent sample of 611 students in the U.S. Midwest. Results indicated that students with higher levels of engagement experienced lower levels of internalizing or externalizing difficulties, as well as higher levels of SWB. Additionally, linear regressions revealed that as students reported higher school connectedness and academic efficacy, they also reported higher behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement. Internalizing difficulties predicted higher behavioral and cognitive engagement, and personal adjustment predicted lower behavioral and cognitive engagement. Internalizing and externalizing difficulties were not significantly associated with emotional engagement. Overall, results indicate that students’ mental health factors are closely tied to their engagement at school. These findings can be used to support targeted interventions on well-being and psychopathology, which may increase school engagement and overall student happiness.
BackgroundMāori (the Indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand) report higher rates of eating disorders than non-Māori, but access treatment at lower rates. Diagnostic terms lacking in cultural relevance likely contribute to Māori exclusion in eating disorder spaces. Developing terms in te reo Māori (the Māori language) presents an opportunity to challenge eating disorder stereotypes and increase cultural safety in the eating disorder workforce.MethodologyGuided by a Māori worldview and the practice of wānanga (to meet, discuss, and think deeply about a topic), we present a Māori language glossary for eating disorders. The glossary is informed by expertise in te reo Māori, mātauranga Māori (the body of Māori knowledge), and eating disorders, and combines terms already in use with newly developed terms.ResultsWe propose an umbrella term for eating disorders (ngā māuiui kai), as well as terms for anorexia nervosa (māuiui whakatiki), bulimia nervosa (pukuruaki), binge eating disorder (māuiui kaihoro), and avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (karo kai, with three subtypes of low interest [arokore kai], sensory-based avoidance [āmaimai rongo kai], and concern about the consequences of eating [wehi-ā-kai]). We also propose terms for related concepts of body image difficulties (māuiui whakawā ata), perfectionism (māuiui kōtihitihi) and emotion dysregulation (kare-a-roto kōtitititi).ConclusionThis glossary is available for use by anyone looking for terms that come from a mana-enhancing (empowering, respectful, and strengths-based) Māori worldview. The kupu (words, terms) in this glossary are offered as possibilities for use, rather than as definitive or correct, in the hopes they will promote discussion about stigma, indigeneity, and language in the eating disorders field.
BackgroundPathological eating and addictive processes are linked to obesity. Food addiction (FA) involves hedonic eating of highly palatable foods, accompanied by addictive symptoms like craving, loss-of-control (LOC) eating, and withdrawal. The main objectives of this study were to assess FA prevalence and symptoms in bariatric surgery candidates, and its relationship with depression, dysregulated eating, and 1- year postoperative weight loss (WL).MethodsData from 69 bariatric surgery patients (74% female, 26% male, ) were analysed. Self-report measures including Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) 2.0, Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Repetitive Eating Questionnaire [Rep(eat)-Q] and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered pre-surgery and at 1-year follow-up.ResultsThe mean preoperative YFAS symptom score was 2.2. (SD = 2.59). 16% of the sample met YFAS diagnostic criteria for FA. Top reported FA criteria were “substance taken in larger amount than intended” (33%), “persisted desire or repeated unsuccessful attempts to quit” (29%), and “use in physically hazardous situations” (23%). The YFAS symptom scores correlated significantly with the frequency of LOC binge eating, depression and repetitive eating scores, but showed no correlation with age or BMI. Preoperative YFAS symptom scores did not significantly predict % WL at 1-year follow-up.ConclusionsOur findings align with previous research, indicating that preoperative FA symptoms is unrelated to preoperative BMI and total %WL, but linked to eating pathology, such as LOC binge eating and grazing, as well as depression in bariatric surgery candidates.
BackgroundResearch on marital happiness in Middle Eastern cultures is lacking. This lack of understanding has created several challenges for policymakers and marriage counselors as divorce rates have increased over the past decade.MethodThis study aimed to assess the prevalence of marital happiness among Omani couples and its association with demographic variables, including gender, level of education, and duration of marriage. A convenience sample of 1137 married people from different regions in Oman responded to the Marital Happiness Scale.ResultsOmani couples, in general, indicated a high level of marital happiness. Married men seemed significantly happier about their marriages than wives did. Income and education level also affect perceived marital happiness. Marital happiness increased as income increased while level of education was partially associated with marital happiness. Place of living was not a significant predictor of marital happiness. Lower levels of perceived marital happiness among couples in polygamous marriages were observed. The spouses' kinship did not affect their perception of marital happiness.ConclusionThis study showed that financial stressors and education level significantly influence marital happiness. Men and women also perceive marital happiness differently. The results offer implications for research and practice, especially for policymakers and marital counselors.
BackgroundComorbidity studies in trichotillomania and skin picking disorder (known as Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors, BFRBs) have traditionally not examined rates of borderline personality disorder. When it co-occurs, borderline personality disorder may necessitate different treatment approaches and if untreated may interfere with the response to the treatment for trichotillomania or skin picking disorder. The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the rate of co-occurring borderline personality disorder in BFRBs; and (2) explore associations between co-occurring borderline personality disorder and relevant clinical characteristics (such as demographic features, BFRB symptom severity, lifetime history of suicide attempt[s], levels of dissociation, and other comorbidities including impulsive conditions that are often unmeasured in studies).MethodsAdults with skin picking disorder, trichotillomania, or both completed an online survey. The survey was comprised of demographic and clinical questions, plus instruments to measure for probable borderline personality disorder, as well as BFRB severity, dissociation, impulse control conditions (including BFRBs), and alcohol use disorder. Each participant also completed questions about previous formal mental health diagnoses.ResultsOf the 281 adults with BFRBs (n= 105 with skin picking disorder; 93 with trichotillomania, and 82 with both disorders), 105 (37.4%) screened positive for a probable diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Participants screening positive for probable borderline personality disorder reported significantly worse pulling and picking symptoms (p< .001), higher rates of dissociation (p< .001), and were significantly more likely to report lifetime suicide attempts (p< .001) and to endorse co-occurring alcohol problems (p< .001), compulsive buying disorder (p< .001), gambling disorder (p< .001), compulsive sexual behavior (p< 001), and kleptomania (p= .005).ConclusionsThese data suggest relatively high rates of borderline personality disorder in people with BFRBs, in turn linked to more severe psychopathology and elevated lifetime suicide attempt risk. Perhaps the comorbidity with borderline personality disorder reflects a possible subtype of these behaviors that is more impulsive and may necessitate different treatment approaches.
BackgroundClimate change anxiety, that is worry and fear in relation to the awareness of the impacts of climate change, is widely observed around the world. Some evidence suggests that while climate change anxiety can, at times, be adaptive, a growing body of research has reported that climate change anxiety is also related to a range of negative mental health outcomes and psychological distress. Currently, however, there is limited ability to assess for elevated levels of climate change anxiety and to identify those who may need support. The present study, therefore, aimed to develop clinical cut-off scores on a measure of climate change anxiety.MethodsA largely representative sample of Australian young adults (aged 16–25 years) completed measures of psychological distress (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21) and the Climate Change Anxiety Scale. Markers of clinically meaningful psychological distress – elevated depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms—were used to classify cases. Receiver Operating Characteristics analyses were performed to assess the predictive ability of the indicators of psychological distress (mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe thresholds of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms) for detecting climate change anxiety and to ascertain optimal cut-off scores.ResultsThe Area Under the Curve was acceptable to moderate for detecting climate change anxiety across all analyses. Across symptom severity thresholds and markers of psychological distress, based on consideration of balancing sensitivity and specificity, results consistently suggested that a cut-score of 21 was indicative of mild-moderate climate change anxiety, with a cut-off score of 23 indicating severe-extremely severe climate change anxiety.ConclusionsThe proposed cut-offs can feasibly be used to identify those with elevated climate change anxiety. Use of these cut-off scores can inform research as well as be used to guide screening, assessment, and inform clinical practice. Results also highlight a high rate of climate change anxiety in young adults.
Managing learning efforts and self-regulation skills are crucial for academic performance. Graduate students are considered more mature and utilize more sophisticated learning strategies than undergraduates. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, they may have struggled with challenging academic tasks, transition to online course modality, and additional family responsibilities. This study examines how graduate students’ adjustment, mental health, and motivation impact their use of self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies. An anonymous online survey was distributed via Qualtrics between November and December 2021. The survey incorporated a demographic questionnaire, College Adjustment Test (CAT), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and selected subscales from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The study gathered responses from 301 graduate students enrolled at a large southeastern university in the United States. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The final model suggests that mental health and motivation factors may significantly and directly impact SRL strategies. Within the model, mental health factors, such as stress, seem to positively affect SRL strategies, while depression suggests a negative impact. Intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy in motivation had a positive influence on SRL strategies based on the model. Additionally, graduate students’ adjustment could influence their use of learning strategies via the mediation of these mental health and motivation factors. The opposite effects of positive and negative adjustment, as mediated by stress, depression, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy were also discussed.
BackgroundEmerging adulthood is a developmental phase marked by increased vulnerability to risky behaviors, including alcohol misuse. Pathological narcissism, particularly grandiose and vulnerable traits, has been identified as a key factor influencing alcohol misuse. The role of mentalized affectivity (namely, the ability to identify, express, and process emotions) may enhance these associations, along with potential gender differences in these dynamics.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,075 emerging adults (M= 24.26,SD= 2.43; 71.2% assigned female at birth), using self-reports to measure pathological narcissism, mentalization difficulties, and alcohol misuse. Hierarchical regression models were used to examine the relationships between narcissistic traits, mentalized affectivity, and alcohol misuse.ResultsGrandiose narcissism was associated with alcohol misuse in the total sample. Narcissistic vulnerability was a stronger predictor of alcohol misuse in female individuals, while difficulties in mentalization (identifying and expressing emotions) were significant predictors of alcohol misuse in males. Grandiose narcissism did not directly predict alcohol misuse in either gender, after controlling for Narcissistic vulnerability.ConclusionsVulnerable narcissism plays a significant role in alcohol misuse, especially in female individuals, with mentalization difficulties exacerbating these behaviors, particularly in male individuals. Gender differences highlight the need for gender-specific interventions in emerging adults.
Reciprocal effects between life satisfaction and help expectancy or predicted help in the future are plausible but obscure and debatable theoretically and empirically. The plausibility rests on exchange theory regarding satisfaction and help as exchangeable favors. However, help expectancy, largely empirically uncharted, can signify social demand and dependency impeding satisfaction. This debate urges the present study to use a panel survey of 12,000 residents in China from 2015 to 2018 to estimate the reciprocal effects simultaneously. Results show statistically significant reciprocal contributions between life satisfaction and help expectancy, controlling for their prior states in the resident and his or her spouse. Notably, the concurrent contribution of help expectancy to life satisfaction was slight and only half of the reverse contribution. Meanwhile, lagged reciprocal effects between life satisfaction and help expectancy were nonsignificant. Results thus imply that promoting help expectancy would only be slightly effective in advancing life satisfaction.
Engaging in uncommitted sexual relationships increases the risk of pathogen transmission through close contact with novel partners. As such, greater disease avoidance tendencies may be associated with lower sociosexuality. Across three studies, we examined this proposition. In Studies 1a and 1b, we cross-sectionally assessed the associations between individual differences in disease avoidance (i.e., germ aversion, perceived infectability) and sociosexuality dimensions (i.e., behavior, attitude, desire). Greater germ aversion was significantly associated with more restricted sociosexuality across all three dimensions and replicated in both samples. Perceived infectibility was associated with more unrestricted sociosexual attitude and desire, but only in Study 1a. In Study 2, we tested whether sociosexuality levels changed with the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants reported more restricted sociosexuality levels during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels, where a decrease was especially seen in sociosexual desire. Further, this decrease in sociosexual desire was predicted by pre-pandemic germ aversion levels. Overall, the findings indicate that disease avoidance tendencies (i.e., germ aversion) and real-life disease threat are associated with lower tendency to engage in uncommitted sexual relationships. Further research is needed to understand the causal relation of these two constructs, which may help in developing interventions and campaigns to support better sexual health.
BackgroundAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs) play a significant role on emotional and psychological outcomes in adulthood, including vindictiveness, emotional awareness, self-esteem and hurt feeling. This study sought to examine the relationship between early ACEs and their effects on vindictive behavior, emotional awareness, hurt feelings, and self-esteem in adults.MethodA total of 500 university students aged 18 to 47 participated in the study, among these 246 were selected through screening. Initially adverse childhood experiences of participants were screened using a Life Event Scale. Vindictive behavior was assessed using the Vengeance Scale, while Emotional awareness, hurt feelings, and self-esteem were measured through the Trait Emotional Awareness Scale, Hurt Feeling Scale, and Self-Esteem Scale, respectively.ResultsThe findings suggests that individuals who recalled negative childhood experiences were more likely to show vindictive behavior in adulthood. Moreover, the study revealed that this relationship between adverse childhood experiences and vindictive behavior were higher in individuals with low emotional awareness and self-esteem. Furthermore this association become significantly stronger in individuals experiencing heightened level of hurt feelings.ConclusionThe study highlights the significance of early adverse childhood experiences in understanding of vindictive behavior. Furthermore, it emphasizes that low emotional awareness, self-esteem, and the experience of hurt feelings act as mediating factors associated with behavioral patterns.
This commentary article will seek to improve the understanding of Psychosocial Rehabilitation (PR) for persons experiencing mental health problems and will also explore interpersonal recovery options for those with mental health issues including those with psychotic disorders to identify the potential factors affecting the application of Psychosocial rehabilitation (PR) in Lower Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) settings. This article discusses the moderating factors that influence PR implementation including availability of resources, negative attitudes associated with PR, staff burnout, and setting up of PR in healthcare organisations. In addition, it emphasizes clinical and non-clinical aspects of PR like programs in community setting, participation of caregivers and art therapy. The purpose is to provide recommendations on best practices that can support the further implementation of PR and recovery-centred practices in LMICs.
In their recent systematic review, van Zyl et al. (2023) summarized contemporary critiques formulated toward the field of positive psychology. Within this research field, considerable differences exist with regard to the rigor of the methodological strategies used in each domain or subfield. These authors have identified six “broad critiques/criticisms” or overarching themes: “(a) positive psychology lacks proper theorizing and conceptual thinking; (b) the measurement of positive psychological constructs and the research methodologies are problematic; (c) positive psychology is a pseudoscience that lacks empirical evidence and shows poor replicability; (d) positive psychology lacks novelty and self-isolates from mainstream and general psychology; (e) positive psychology is a decontextualized neo-liberalist ideology that caused harm; and (f) positive psychology is a capitalistic venture” (van Zyl et al.,2023, p. 7). In this article, we use these six themes to allow us to identify some of the strengths and weaknesses of the Dualistic Model of Passion (Vallerand,2015), thereby contributing to making recommendations as to how to improve the subfield of passion research. We believe that applying this systematic and critical analysis to other subfields of positive psychology should ultimately contribute to improving the future development of positive psychology as a whole.
Emerging evidence suggests that environmental concern and healthy levels of climate anxiety can spark climate action among the youth. However, very little is known about how efficacy beliefs related to climate mitigation come into play with environmental concern and climate anxiety in encouraging climate action. Hence, this study investigated a moderated mediation model predicting engagement in climate action among the youth in the Philippines, one of the top climate hazard countries globally. Specifically, the study tested the positive relationship between environmental concern and climate actionviaclimate anxiety and the moderating effect of mitigation response efficacy beliefs. This cross-sectional study involved 467 Filipino adolescents (Mean age = 19.19;SDage = 1.02) recruited through an online questionnaire comprising measures of climate anxiety, environmental concern, self-reported climate action, and mitigation response efficacy. Findings revealed a positive association between environmental concern and engagement in climate action. The study also found a significant mediation effect of climate anxiety on the relationship between environmental concern and engagement in climate action among individuals with high levels of mitigation response efficacy but not among those with moderate and low levels of efficacy beliefs. Climate anxiety is a psychological mechanism linking the positive influence of environmental concern on climate action among Filipino youth. The mediating effect of climate anxiety is more salient when adolescents believe that individual and collective efforts are effective in addressing the climate crisis.
In an academic context, it is important to measure students’ academic motivation, which is closely related to learning improvement. One popular and widely used instrument to measure academic motivation is the 28-items Academic Motivation Scale (AMS) from Vallerand et al. (1989). This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Indonesian version of AMS using the Rasch model measurement approach. A total of 1,193 Indonesian secondary school students participated in the study, and their self-reports were used to check instrument quality, including reliability, validity at the instrument level as well as at the item level. The findings showed that AMS Indonesia has adequate psychometric properties. However, four unfavorable items in one construct detected that they came from other dimensions, the rating scale used needs to be shortened, and a few items need to be revised because they have different item functioning. Further testing and refinement of the scale should be conducted.
Adolescent social media serves a broad range of functions, which may be helpful for some and harmful for others. During the COVID-19 lockdown, social media evolved considerably, occupying an even more central role in adolescents’ lives. This study leverages a new approach to measuring social media use behaviors—passive smartphone sensing. Specifically, we aimed to test if and how adolescents self-regulate their social media use in response to how they feel during and after use. This study followed 19 adolescents for 1 month. Participants completed baseline measures, assessing demographic and clinical characteristics. We used passive smartphone sensing to measure objective social media use behaviors (“screen time” and checking) for a 1-month period. Adolescents also completed daily diary questions on their mood. Analyses took an idiographic (n= 1) approach. Dynamic structural equation models tested daily and next-day relationships between social media use behaviors and mood for each adolescent. Most adolescents (n= 13 of 19) did not self-regulate their social media use in relation to their mood. Most importantly, they did not use it less when they felt more negative mood during use. That said, some adolescents (n= 6) did alter their social media use behaviors depending on their mood. Each adolescent’s pattern of social media use and mood was also qualitatively interpreted within their context of demographic (e.g., experience of holding a minoritized identity) and clinical characteristics (e.g., history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors). These results highlight the next steps for possible intervention points to help adolescents adjust their use patterns to maximize mental health benefits while minimizing possible harm. Findings also begin to develop a template for applying social media use recommendations, while centering the experiences of individual adolescents.
PurposePeople with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) require comprehensive sexuality and relationship education (SRE) for healthy sexual development, which refers to the lifelong process of acquiring knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors around sexual health that foster well-being and personal fulfillment. In this emerging research field, our aim is to consolidate scientific literature findings and gain a clear understanding of existing gaps. We plan to achieve this by conducting a systematic integrative review, analyzing the development and design process of interventions for individuals with ASD or Developmental Disorder up to February 2023. Furthermore, we place significant emphasis on evaluating the effectiveness of programs for both participants and their families. This comprehensive approach allows us to analyze the overall impact of interventions and provide a more complete understanding of their effectiveness in practical contexts. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on seven databases: ProQuest Dissertation, Scopus, Web of Science, Dialnet, ERIC, PsycInfo, and Pubmed. 20 articles met the inclusion criteria (1 randomized controlled trial, 7 mixed methods, and 12 non-randomized). The methodological quality of the studies was assessed with Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), version 2018. Results: The low quality of the studies does not allow us to confirm that the programs are effective in increasing the level of knowledge, although most of the studies reflect positive results that suggest that the participants have benefited from the training received. Conclusions: This review has allowed us to discover the existing deficiencies in this field, as well as to detect how they could be improved.
Mothers face considerable parenting challenges because of premature birth and its subsequent phases. This study aims to develop a grounded theory that encompasses the psychosocial experiences of mothers with premature infants in Türkiye, spanning from the prenatal period to the child’s school age. Charmaz’s (2014) constructivist grounded theory methodology was employed. Initial analyses involved a document containing in-depth interview transcriptions from nine mothers. Subsequently, a Facebook group for mothers with premature infants was observed, becoming a crucial data source through theoretical sampling, involving 287 mothers and their cross-sectional or longitudinal data. The mean age of mothers was 34.5 ± 4.6 years old. The grounded theory, ‘Becoming a marginalized mother,’ highlights individual and collective parenting experiences of mothers within two main categories. ‘Navigating a challenging journey’ involves beginning a traumatic motherhood journey, struggling as a mother, trying to cope, and embracing the role of mothering a premature infant. ‘Journeying together’ involves seeing the group as a valuable source, building a sense of unity, and finding comfort and support. Mothers’ individual and collective experiences contained the feeling of marginalization as a mother. Mothers experienced psychological distress and positive psychological changes over an extended timeline. Results emphasize the contributions of improvements in children’s health and development, personal coping strategies, and positive online group interactions as social support on embracing the role of mothering a premature infant and, herewith, mothers’ psychological health. Therefore, it should be essential to support mothers’ personal and social resources and their infant’s health and development longitudinally with an interdisciplinary approach in practice. Results discussed within the Stress Theory and Post-Traumatic Growth Model.
Shame significantly influences identity formation, often undermining one’s sense of self. Since the exacerbation of racial discrimination against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian American youth have struggled with increased incidents of anti-Asian hate and significant psychological impacts. This paper explores the intersection of racial discrimination and identity formation among Asian American youth, focusing on how experiences of shame influence their sense of self. It examines the historical context of Asian American identity struggles, using contemporary literature, particularly Gene Luen Yang’sAmerican Born Chinese. Building on Donald Capps’s theories on shame and self-identity, the paper examines the relationship between shame and the challenges of selfhood. It further considers how embracing shame can empower individuals to reclaim their authentic selves, drawing on Jesus’s experiences with shame in his childhood and on the cross. Ultimately, it explores ways Asian American youth might embrace their experience of shame and vulnerability to promote their self-identity.
Despite the established benefits of standardization, such as safety, reliability, and efficiency, its impact on creativity and innovation remains contentious, with existing research showing both detrimental and beneficial effects. This study proposes that the relationship between standardization of work and team innovation depends on the distinction between the generation and implementation of creative ideas. This study argues that standardization's benefits, through resource conservation, will mainly benefit the implementation of ideas. Further, it proposes that these beneficial effects of standardization hinge on the organization's explicit valuation and reward of innovation, shaping the allocation of conserved resources. The investigation utilizes a multilevel field data set (N = 119 teams) and an experimental approach (N = 81 teams) to examine how standardization and rewards for innovation moderate the relationship between team creativity and innovation outcomes. The findings contribute to understanding the multifaceted role of standard work procedures and rewards in fostering team innovation, arguing that these effects should be considered within the context of resource conservation and allocation.
This paper revisits D. W. Winnicott’s famous account of his patient Piggle to examine the profound nature of her response to the birth of her baby sister in the light of the concepts of object constancy and absence. The author speculates that recent scholarship revealing the mother’s Holocaust family history enables us to hypothesise that Piggle’s infancy might have been marked by her mother’s psychic absence. This contributed to difficulties in the establishment of object constancy leaving her vulnerable to more extreme responses to later absences, such as at the birth of her sister. The focus of Winnicott’s interpretations at an Oedipal level is critiqued as is the significance of the psychoanalysis-on-demand setting of the work.
Paradoxical leadership, which entails the simultaneous display of contradictory behaviors, has been shown to have positive effects on employees. However, its potential negative impacts have been largely overlooked. Drawing on social information processing theory, we propose that paradoxical leadership negatively influences employee proactive behavior by increasing employee perceived leader role ambiguity and employee role ambiguity. These effects are moderated by employee information seeking. The results of two studies (Study 1: a scenario-based experimental study of 142 employees; Study 2: a four-wave two-source field survey of 404 supervisor-employee dyads) support our hypotheses and show that paradoxical leadership reduces employee proactive behavior by creating ambiguity for both employees’ perceived leader roles and their own roles. Furthermore, this negative relationship is attenuated when employees seek more information from their leaders. The implications and limitations of our research are discussed.
Amidst the predominantly risk-focused narrative of adolescent sexual health, sexual pleasure is often overlooked. This study examined the association between adolescents’ experienced sexual pleasure and profiles of sexual double standard (SDS) norms, which prescribe divergent expectations of sexuality based on gender. The sample consisted of 209 Dutch adolescents aged 16–20 years (57% female) who have had sexual intercourse. A survey assessed adolescents’ endorsement of SDS norms and perceived SDS norms of parents, peers, and the media, as well as adolescents’ experienced sexual pleasure. Latent profile analysis identified four distinct profiles. Profile 1 involved adolescents who held traditional personal views (e.g., seeing men as sexually dominant, women as sexually passive), but perceived less traditional external norms. Profile 2 included adolescents with egalitarian personal views (e.g., expecting similar sexual behaviors of men and women) and perceptions of less traditional external norms. Adolescents in Profile 3 had traditional personal views and perceived more traditional external messages. Adolescents in Profile 4 had egalitarian personal views coexisting with perceptions of less traditional peer and parent norms, but more traditional media norms. These profiles differed significantly in reported sexual pleasure by adolescents, with the highest levels of sexual pleasure observed in Profiles 2 and 3 and the lowest in Profile 1. Adolescent gender did not significantly moderate these relationships, indicating similar relations between SDS norms and sexual pleasure across genders. The findings underscore the complex interplay between personal norms and perceived social norms about sexuality, emphasizing the need for tailored educational strategies that effectively support adolescents in navigating differing social norms about sexuality during their sexual development.
The current study examined the association between interpersonal social goals (i.e., agentic and communal goals) and bullying behaviour for autistic adolescents (n= 108,Mage= 15.25 years,SD= 1.65) and neurotypical adolescents (n= 592,Mage= 13 years,SD= 0.5). Bullying behaviour was assessed using both self- and peer-reported measures. Agentic and communal social goals were assessed using the child version of the Interpersonal Goal Index. Measurement properties of the Interpersonal Goal Index were first examined, and some features were found to differ across autistic and neurotypical adolescents. Bullying behaviour was associated with agentic goals for neurotypical adolescents whereas communal goals were associated with bullying for autistic adolescents, suggesting a mismatch between social goals and social behaviours for this group. This insight suggests that the dynamics of bullying behaviour differ between neurotypical and autistic adolescents, and highlight the need for the development of autistic-led assessment and support for bullying.
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify and evaluate the quality of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), assessing the efficacy of Social Skills Group Programs (SSGPs) for primary and secondary school aged autistic children and adolescents exploring the influence of informant, setting characteristics and teaching strategies as moderating factors for social outcomes. A search of the electronic databases of Medline, ProQuest, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Sciences electronic databases was conducted for the period January 1, 2013 until December 31, 2023 for peer-reviewed RCT studies published in English, evaluating the efficacy of SSGPs for school-aged autistic children and adolescents (6–18 years). Included studies were assessed for methodological quality and efficacy using random effect meta-analysis. Informant analysis and moderator analyses were also conducted investigating the influence of informant, setting characteristics and teaching strategy utilised in the SSGPs on the participants social outcomes. Sixty-five studies were included in the systematic review with 49 studies included in the meta-analysis. Although most studies had strong or good methodological quality, a high possibility of publication bias was detected in the meta-analysis. After statistical adjustments for publication bias were made, findings revealed that SSGPs had no effect on the overall outcomes assessed by included studies on school-aged autistic children and adolescents. However, informant analysis revealed small effects reported by self-report, parent-proxy and researchers. Teaching strategies and setting characteristics were not significant moderators for the efficacy of SSGPs on the social outcomes of autistic children and adolescents. This review highlights the need for improvements in measurement frameworks for assessing social skills in autistic children and adolescents.
Non-suicidal self-injury, or NSSI, is increasing across the globe, especially among adolescents and young adults (Muehlenkamp et al., inChil and Adol Psy and Ment Heal, 6, 2012). Trauma-informed assessment practices have been absent from many behavioral health crisis settings. Some crisis clinicians respond with personal bias about NSSI (Thomas et al., inAdmini and Pol in Ment Heal and Ment Heal Ser Res,45(4), 611–622, 2018). The principles of trauma-informed care applied in behavioral health crisis settings include promoting awareness of trauma, ensuring safety for the client, trustworthiness and transparency in service delivery, collaboration and empowerment of the client, humility and responsiveness to client needs, honoring peer support and mutual self-help efforts, and sensitivity to cultural considerations (Adams et al., inJ Pro Coun.: Pra Theo & Res,49(2), 91–107, 2022). With education, clinicians are more likely to provide trauma-informed, effective care for patients who engage in NSSI. A review of current research about non-suicidal self-injury or NSSI may add to an improved understanding of the prevalence, functions, and best practice guidelines for responding to this growing problem. A detailed search of peer-reviewed literature has identified multiple research studies employing various methodologies. NSSI has no global definition, contributing to risk assessment clinicians’ confusion. There is an association between NSSI and suicide when the individual engages in NSSI repetitively. While more clinicians are encountering NSSI, limited studies have established prevalence rates because of the secrecy and stigma associated with these behaviors. Common risk factors include early trauma, isolation, and poor management of strong emotions. Some studies have identified the importance of peer support as an essential component of mitigating the risk in youth who engage in NSSI. Cultural differences require creating culturally sensitive approaches to this serious public health issue.
Cognitive and emotional dimensions are commonly included in the measurement of place attachment, yet behavioral indicators are often overlooked. While many researchers consider place dependence as the conative component of place attachment, it primarily reflects the functional advantages one location offers over another for performing specific behaviors. Similarly, although place attachment is frequently regarded as an antecedent of various pro-environmental behaviors, this perspective fails to directly assess behaviors that demonstrate the development of place attachment itself. This study aims to measure place attachment through items representing emotional, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions, examine its relationship with place identity, and explore whether places offering security and satisfaction foster proximity-seeking behavior, as suggested by social attachment theory and Aging in place approach. The results indicate that the cognitive-emotional component of place attachment is significantly stronger than its behavioral counterpart. However, both components are markedly lower when the neighborhood is chosen for economic reasons or when residents hold a negative perception of their neighborhood. In addition, favourable conditions and strong relationships with neighbours, which are considered important elements of the social capital of a place, are essential for the development of the behavioural component. In contrast, only the cognitive-emotional component significantly influences place identity. Lastly, the behavioral component accounts for the greatest variance in physical proximity to the neighborhood, underscoring the importance of behavioral manifestations in establishing an attachment bond.
Paranoia (believing others intend harm) and excess teleological thinking (ascribing too much purpose) are non-consensual beliefs about agents. Human vision rapidly detects agents and their intentions. Might paranoia and teleology have roots in visual perception? Using displays that evoke the impression that one disc (‘wolf’) is chasing another (‘sheep’), we find that paranoia and teleology involve perceiving chasing when there is none (studies 1 and 2) — errors we characterize as social hallucinations. When asked to identify the wolf or the sheep (studies 3, 4a, and 4b), we find high-paranoia participants struggled to identify sheep, while high-teleology participants were impaired at identifying wolves — both despite high-confidence. Both types of errors correlated with hallucinatory percepts in the real world. Although paranoia and teleology both involve excess perception of agency, the current results collectively suggest a perceptual distinction between the two, perhaps with clinical import.
Agencies across the country have begun the practice of having police and public safety officers attend annual wellness visits with a mental health professional. While wellness visits are increasing in frequency, with some states enacting legal mandates, little is known about how these visits are conducted. Eighty-seven clinicians responded to a survey about their practices related to this service. Summaries of the content covered in wellness visits, the procedures for carrying out visits, the outcome of the visits, and issues related to the laws and regulations governing visits are provided. Practitioners also offered opinions on what to call this service, about the primary purposes of the visits, and on what other psychological services they believe can be provided by the same clinician within a department offering the visits. While many consistent practices were revealed, some variation and disagreement were apparent. Important issues that require clarification and guidance for clinicians who conduct wellness visits include the use of testing, the amount of information reported back to the agency, and the requirements for recording keeping. The data herein provides a first look at the practice of conducting wellness visits and initial recommendations are offered for a path forward to effectively use this service to protect and enhance the mental health and well-being of officers.
The current conceptual review highlights considerations surrounding the potential for non-beneficence and undue coercion within the practices of psychologists and other clinicians providing substance use treatment for youth. The potential for nonbeneficence and undue coercion is assessed at three key stages of treatment for youth with substance use disorders (SUDs): the informed consent process, maintaining confidentiality, and treatment planning. We explore these concerns as they relate to the ethical principles of psychologists as outlined by the American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association [APA], 2017), as well as pertinent state and national legislative guidelines. The paper culminates in actionable recommendations to resolve these inconsistencies in practice and emphasizes opportunities for professionals at all career stages to engage in ethical policy initiatives. These endeavors aim to reduce potential for undue coercion and nonbeneficence from psychologists treating youth with substance use disorders and to elucidate beneficial treatment pathways for youth navigating substance use challenges.
Stance is a psychological state that encompasses the speaker’s beliefs, evaluative abilities, and attitudes. Since the late 1980s, corpus-assisted approaches have been predominantly employed in the field of stance-taking, yet no systematic literature review has been conducted on how corpus linguistics assists stance research. This study reviewed 453 articles published from 2004 to 2023 and revealed key insights into the evolution of corpus linguistics within this interdisciplinary domain. The review examines the evolving role of corpus linguistics in conjunction with other linguistic strands, such as pragmatics, (critical) discourse analysis, systemic-functional linguistics, sociolinguistics, and discursive psychology, to offer a nuanced understanding of stance-taking across diverse genres and contexts. It also identifies a shift from a focus on lexical-grammatical stance markers to a broader exploration of functional categories, syntactic structures, acoustic-phonetic features, and other non-linguistic devices such as multi-modal stance-taking. Additionally, the review highlights a growing emphasis on corpus-driven approaches, which analyze linguistic patterns in a bottom-up manner. It also underscores the increasing application of corpus methods across diverse genres, including academic, political, corporate, and media discourse. Future research should investigate the intricate interplay between stance and other linguistic phenomena, considering social, cultural, and psychological factors. It should also leverage advanced AI technologies with corpus linguistics to gain a comprehensive understanding of stance-taking, with a focus on multi-modal and interactional stances within digital communication contexts. This study consolidates existing knowledge, identifies research gaps, and suggests pathways for further investigation into stance across different communicative settings.
Critical and creative thinking dispositions are essential for pre-service teachers, as these skills are crucial for effective teaching. Despite their importance, research focusing specifically on these dispositions in pre-service teachers remains limited. Moreover, the existing studies that do explore the interplay between critical and creative thinking often overlook the mediating role of self-efficacy and predominantly rely on cross-sectional data. This study addresses these gaps by investigating the dynamic relationship between critical and creative thinking dispositions and the mediating role of self-efficacy among pre-service teachers using longitudinal data. A three-wave longitudinal study was conducted over a four-month period, collecting data from 529 pre-service teachers who completed all waves. Latent Growth Modeling (LGM) was employed to analyze the responses. Results showed slight increases in critical thinking (M1 = 42.18, M2 = 42.39, M3 = 43.81), self-efficacy (M1 = 30.04, M2 = 30.32, M3 = 31.44), and creative thinking disposition (M1 = 97.51, M2 = 97.80, M3 = 99.35) over time. Self-efficacy was positively correlated with both initial levels and longitudinal changes in critical thinking (intercept β = 0.63, slope β = 0.68,p< 0.001) and creative thinking (intercept β = 0.66, slope β = 0.62,p< 0.001) dispositions. Importantly, self-efficacy significantly mediated the relationship between critical and creative thinking dispositions at the initial level (indirect effect β = 0.601,p< 0.001) and over time (indirect effect β = 0.510,p< 0.001). These findings underscore the importance of nurturing self-efficacy in pre-service teachers throughout their university education to enhance their critical and creative thinking abilities. Designing educational environments emphasizing higher-order thinking skills, such as project-based and problem-based learning methods, is crucial for achieving this developmental goal.
Family caregivers face stress, especially those facing financial burdens. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate non-financial social support intervention’s effectiveness and identify demographic factors linked to higher caregiver depression risk. We attempted to investigate whether social support could protect caregivers from experiencing depression. We introduced non-financial social support by offering a range of workshops and activities to help reduce stress experienced by the caregivers. We recruited 462 informal family caregivers from a Hong Kong nonprofit organization. They completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and a demographic characteristics questionnaire before and after the intervention. The effectiveness of the intervention was analyzed with ANOVA on pre- and post-intervention BDI-II scores. The research findings suggested that the intervention effectively reduced family caregivers’ depression levels. The intervention was more effective for caregivers facing financial difficulties. Additionally, this study revealed that single-family caregivers are more susceptible to depression. This research validates the effectiveness of our intervention for family caregivers in preventing them from developing depression. Policymakers should subsidize social welfare organizations to offer more non-financial interventions and social support for caregivers within the community.
Excessive internet gaming can lead to the development of internet gaming disorder (IGD) in some individuals, while others who engage in regular gaming do not exhibit the disorder. This study aimed to investigate cognitive factors in individuals with internet gaming disorder compared to recreational game users (RGU) and nonusers (NU). Ninety volunteers were categorized into three groups based on diagnostic interviews and the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale-9. Participants completed assessments of gaming-related cognitions using the Internet Gaming Cognition Scale (IGCS), inhibitory control over gaming stimuli using a Go/NoGo task, attentional bias towards gaming stimuli using a Stroop task, and coping strategies using the Brief-COPE. Results showed that individuals with IGD differed significantly from RGU and NU groups in gaming-related cognitions, inhibitory control specifically over gaming stimuli, attentional bias towards gaming stimuli, and use of active coping strategies. There were no differences in inhibitory control or attentional bias between the groups when assessed using non-gaming stimuli, indicating these deficits are specific to gaming-related cues. There were no differences between the RGU and NU groups. The findings suggest that playing games does not inherently result in loss of control or negative consequences for everyone. Additionally, there are cognitive function differences between individuals with IGD and those who engage in healthy recreational gaming. Understanding these cognitive factors, such as the maladaptive cognitions, gaming-specific deficits in inhibitory control, and attentional bias, can inform more effective treatments and preventive interventions for IGD.
We preferentially process self-related information. However, less is known about how this advantage extends to reward processing and if this process is sensitive to a continuum of self-relevance. Specifically, do we dissociate ourselves from all others when processing rewards, or do those we know personally also enjoy self-related biases? To address this, we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data from 30 undergraduate student participants who played a simple two-choice “bandit” gambling game where a photo presented before each gamble indicated whether it benefited either the participant, an individual they knew, or a person they did not know. Temporal spatial principal components analysis (tsPCA) of EEG data evoked by target photos revealed a component consistent with attention and early perceptual processing (the P200), while analysis of data evoked by the feedback stimuli revealed a component consistent with reward processing (the reward positivity). Results demonstrated that P200 component scores were larger for self-gambles than both known- and unknown-other target photos. Interestingly, and contrary to previous findings, reward positivity component scores were similar for all gambles independent of perceived ownership. Our findings suggest that, when gambling for individuals on a continuum of self-relevance, the potential for monetary gain based on the self-relevance cues is differentially processed for ourselves while the actual reward is not. We suggest that the known-other gambling target introduced an empathy-like effect, contesting the self-bias in reward processing.
Three experiments with the psychomotor vigilance task examined whether presenting content-free cues, feedback, and points would reduce lapses of sustained attention. In all three experiments, behavioral lapses of attention (particularly slow reaction times) were reduced with the motivation manipulations compared with control conditions, but self-reports of off-task thinking (e.g., mind-wandering) were unaffected. Pupillary responses (preparatory and phasic) also tended to be larger with the different manipulations compared to control conditions. Collectively, the results are consistent with attentional effort models, suggesting that sustained attention was improved and lapses of attention reduced owing to participants in the motivation conditions mobilizing more attentional effort than participants in the control conditions. These results are consistent with recent research, which suggests that the locus coeruleus norepinephrine system is associated with the mobilization of effort.
The current study examined conservatism’s relationship with child sexual abuse myths and the mediating effect of different dimensions of conservative ideology (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation) on the relationship between religiosity, right-wing political orientation, and child sexual abuse myths. For this cross-sectional study, convenience sampling drew 233 participants via Greek social media platform advertisements and snowball sampling. Bivariate correlations and multiple regression analysis were used to examine associations between child sexual abuse myths and predictor variables. Two parallel mediation models, where religiosity and political positioning predict child sexual abuse myths, mediated by social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism, were also examined using PROCESS macro (model 4). This study’s results provide evidence that religiosity and social dominance orientation, as a facet of conservative ideology, are associated with child sexual abuse myths tolerance. The current research highlights the need to acknowledge the role of conservative ideological dimensions and processes in child sexual abuse myths tolerance. It contributes theoretically and practically to our understanding of child sexual abuse myths, suggesting that social dominance orientation, as a facet of conservative ideology, may significantly predict child sexual abuse myths’ tolerance.
Extensive policy and practice attention aims to support young people as they seek to achieve educational and career goals yet there are widely varying trajectories toward these goals that reflect individual preferences and social inequalities. This study reports findings from qualitative interviews with 16 young adults currently enrolled in a primarily vocational pathway at a community college and who had prior involvement with child welfare, juvenile justice or mental health systems. Using a narrative approach, respondents described their career and educational pathways including their current status, antecedents, and future trajectory. Key factors that have impacted their pathway include their initial vocational interests, messages from within their social networks, and impacts of work and family life on educational goals. Study results have implications for better supporting young people with system involvement to identify and achieve their educational and career goals.
Growing research indicates that sleep problems are a robust independent risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth. However, relatively little is known abouthowthis risk is conferred. This study used an intensive longitudinal design to investigate anhedonia as a mechanism linking sleep problems and next-day suicidal thoughts in a clinically high-risk sample of adolescents. Adolescents (N= 48;Mage=14.96; 77.1% white, 64.6% female) completed an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study design for 28 days following discharge from acute psychiatric care for suicide risk. Daily sleep diaries were used to assess prior night total sleep time and sleep onset latency. Ecological momentary assessment was used to assess anhedonia and suicidal thoughts up to six times per day. A series of multi-level structural equation models were used to examine facets of anhedonia as parallel mediators of the association between sleep problems and next-day suicidal thoughts. Significant direct effects were found between sleep problems and consummatory anhedonia, consummatory anhedonia and suicidal thoughts, and anticipatory anhedonia and suicidal thoughts. There were significant indirect (mediated) effects between sleep problems and next-day suicidal thoughts through consummatory anhedonia, but not anticipatory anhedonia. Findings provide initial evidence as tohowsleep problems may confer risk for next-day suicidal thoughts– by increasing consummatory anhedonia. Future research is needed to replicate these findings in larger samples and investigate how modifying anhedonia may mitigate suicide risk in youth.
We report six experiments that examine how two essential components of a category-learning paradigm, training and feedback, can be manipulated to maximize learning and transfer of real-world, complex concepts. Some subjects learned through classification and were asked to classify hypothetical experiment scenarios as either true or non-true experiments; others learned through observation, wherein these same scenarios were presented along with the corresponding category label. Additionally, some subjects were presented correct-answer feedback (the category label), whereas others were presented explanation feedback (the correct answer and a detailed explanation). For classification training, this feedback was presented after each classification judgment; for observation training this feedback was presented simultaneously with the hypothetical experiment. After the learning phase, subjects completed a posttest that included one task that involved classifying novel hypothetical scenarios and another task comprising multiple-choice questions about novel scenarios, in which subjects had to specify the issue with the scenario or indicate how it could be fixed. The posttest either occurred immediately after the learning phase (Experiments 1–2), 10 min later (Experiments 3–4), two days later (Experiment 5), or one week later (Experiment 6). Explanation feedback generally led to better learning and transfer than correct-answer feedback. However, although subjects showed clear evidence of learning and transfer, posttest performance did not differ between classification and observation training. Critically, various learning theories and principles (e.g., retrieval practice, generation, active learning) predict a classification advantage. Our results thus call into question the extent to which such theories and principles extend to the transfer of learning.
Research involving brands has increased substantially in recent decades. However, no extensive and free dataset of consumer responses to branding stimuli exists. The present research develops and validates such a dataset, which we call theBrand Recognition and Attitude Norms Database(BRAND). BRAND is the most comprehensive set of methodologically transparent, freely available, research-relevant consumer responses to branding stimuli, with measures of familiarity (awareness), liking (attitudes), and memory (recognition) of more than 500 top brands and their logos, spanning 32 industries. BRAND includes 5,356 primary datapoints aggregated from 244,400 raw datapoints (i.e., individual familiarity, liking, and memory responses) collected from 2000 US-resident consumers in 2 years (i.e., 2020 and 2024). The data exhibit good reliability, face validity, external validity, robustness across samples and time, cross-validity, and discriminant validity. BRAND can be broadly useful for testing hypotheses involving responses to brands, and for selecting stimuli in any study involving brands or logos. Thus, BRAND can facilitate research not only in consumer behavior and psychology but also in several related academic disciplines (e.g., economics, management, marketing).
Despite recurring calls for diversity and inclusion in adolescent sexuality research, our understanding of adolescents’ sexual experiences beyond heteronormative vaginal intercourse remains limited. The current study examined orgasm (during masturbation and with a partner) and sexual behaviors (providing and receiving manual and oral stimulation) in middle adolescents. We conducted logistic regression and path analyses separately for cisgender (n= 2738) and transgender/non-binary (TNB) youth (n= 62) to explore gender and dyad type (intersection between gender and partner gender) differences among 2800 Canadian adolescents (51.4% cisgender girls,Mage= 16.41, SDage= 0.55). With cisgender boys as reference, cisgender girls had lower odds of experiencing orgasm during masturbation, reported more difficulties with orgasm during partnered sex, received more manual sex, and less oral sex. TNB individuals assigned male at birth received more manual stimulation, and TNB assigned female at birth received less oral sex. For dyad type, compared to cisgender boys partnered with a girl, cisgender girls partnered with a boy and cisgender girls with a gender diverse partner (i.e., non-binary, trans, genderfluid or agender) had lower odds of having ever experienced orgasm during masturbation, reported more difficulties experiencing orgasm during partnered sex, and received oral stimulation less often. Cisgender girls who were partnered with a girl did not differ from cisgender boys who were partnered with a girl. Findings may inform programs that promote sexual wellbeing among youth.
Perceived racism is the subjective experience one has regarding racism, which may come in the form of blatant discrimination or microaggressions. This study investigated and compared the relations of perceived blatant discrimination and microaggression to university students’ well-being (physical and psychological health, academic adjustment), and how the associations may be influenced by racial/ethnic identity and self-esteem. A self-report survey from racial/ethnic minority university students showed that higher perceived racism was associated with higher stress levels, more somatic symptoms, and worse academic adjustment. Microaggression showed larger negative impact than blatant discrimination. Racial/ethnic identity showed complex effects—a large positive effect by promoting self-esteem and a modest negative effect by intensifying the perception of microaggression. Self-esteem was strongly associated with well-being, yet it also exacerbated the negative association between microaggression and academic adjustment. These findings suggest that racism—microaggression in particular—harm racial/ethnic minority university students in multiple aspects, and that racial/ethnic identity and self-esteem are primarily protective factors, yet mechanisms leading to negative outcomes also exist.
Sexual minority (SM) populations demonstrate greater emotion regulation (ER) difficulties, which are hypothesized to arise from experiences of minority stress. While little is known under which conditions minority stressors may affect ER abilities in SM individuals, previous literature suggests that alexithymia may disrupt ER. Thus, the present study examined the prospective main and interaction effects of SM stressors and alexithymia on ER. SM adults (N= 392) provided baseline and 1-month follow-up reports of SM stressors, alexithymia, and ER. There were significant interaction effects between alexithymia and both heterosexist discrimination and sexual orientation concealment on cognitive reappraisal. Namely, at high levels of alexithymia, sexual orientation concealment and heterosexist discrimination predicted declines in cognitive reappraisal. There were no significant interaction effects between SM stressors and alexithymia on changes in expressive suppression; however, greater internalized stigma and sexual orientation concealment were associated with increases in expressive suppression. Taken together, our findings and theory may suggest that it is critical to address alexithymia in SM clients prior to targeting ER difficulties as alexithymia may disrupt or impede adaptive ER.
Research on endogenous auditory spatial attention typically uses headphones or sounds in the frontal hemispace, which undersamples panoramic spatial hearing. Crossmodal attention studies also show that visual information impacts spatial hearing and attention. Given the overlap between vision and audition in frontal space, we tested the hypothesis that the distribution of endogenous auditory spatial attention would differ when attending to the front versus back hemispace. Participants performed a non-spatial discrimination task where most sounds were presented at a standard location, but occasionally shifted to other locations. Auditory spatial attention cueing and gradient effects across locations were measured in five experiments. Accuracy was greatest at standard versus shift locations, and was comparable when attending to the front or back. Reaction time measures of cueing and gradient effects were larger when attending to the front versus back midline, a finding that was evident when the range of spatial locations was 180° or 360°. When participants were blindfolded, the front/back differences were still present. Sound localization and divided attention tasks showed that the front/back differences were attentional, rather than perceptual, in nature. Collectively, the findings reveal that the impact of endogenous auditory spatial attention depends on where attention is being focused.
Associative learning is a key feature of adaptive behaviour and mental health, enabling individuals to adjust their actions in anticipation of future events. Comprehensive documentation of this essential component of human cognitive development throughout different developmental periods is needed. Here, we investigated age-related changes in associative learning in key developmental stages, including infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. We employed a classical delay eyeblink conditioning paradigm that consisted of two sessions with a total of 48 paired trials. Our initial hypothesis was that performance in associative learning would increase linearly with age. However, our findings suggest that performance peaks during the primary school years: Children in this age-group exhibited superior performance compared to all other age-groups and displayed the most consistent and least variable learning. Adults and adolescents exhibited faster association learning than infants. An additional learning session supported learning in infants and adolescents indicating that during these developmental stages, consolidation processes are vital for learning. A comprehensive account of the development of associative learning may inform theories on aetiology and treatment options in clinical psychology and neurosciences.
To build a comprehensive validity argument for inferences about learners, a wide variety of data sources should be used. Response process data can be particularly useful for understanding examinees’ response processes and make inferences about their scores. Data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) contains the total response time for each item. Drawing on the U.S. PIAAC literacy data set, the purpose of this study was to examine the response process time of adults from different age groups using the differential response time (DRT) procedure. Three research questions were addressed: whether adults of different age groups show different response times on PIAAC literacy items; whether such differences remain after we control for examinees’ literacy ability; and what are the characteristics of items that show differential response time (when overall literacy ability is controlled for). We found a consistent pattern that participants in the older group used more time than those in the younger group when responding to each of the 52 PIAAC literacy items. When the examinees’ total literacy ability was controlled for, the older group spent more time responding to six out of 52 items than the younger group did. We also examined the characteristics of items that showed DRT. Findings from this study could help with interpreting observed differences in PIAAC literacy test scores between older and younger adults. A deeper understanding of adult learners' response process also has important implications for adult literacy assessment strategies.
Early literacy is essential for the enhancement of language skills in young children. A bidirectional relationship may exist between Theory of Mind (ToM) and reading comprehension. This study utilized an empirical research methodology to investigate the connection between reading comprehension and ToM. The sample consisted of 62 children aged 4 to 5 years, who were randomly assigned to either experimental or control groups. The experimental group received training in Theory of Mind, and the effects of this training on their reading comprehension were evaluated. The results revealed a significant increase in ToM levels in the trained group compared to their pre-training assessments. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between ToM scores and reading ability scores, with the trained group exhibiting significantly higher reading ability scores than the untrained group. Therefore, ToM training can effectively improve children’s reading skills.
ObjectivesNearly one third of adults in the US experience at least one anxiety disorder over the course of their lifetime. Trait mindfulness is associated with fewer symptoms of anxiety. This study examined two such factors from positive psychology that may help to explain this relationship: hope and optimism.MethodTwo-hundred and nine participants completed self-report measures of anxiety symptoms, trait mindfulness, hope, and optimism at two timepoints.ResultsTrait mindfulness was negatively associated with anxiety symptoms at both baseline and follow-up. Bias-corrected bootstrapping mediation indicated that optimism, but not hope, mediated this relationship.ConclusionsTrait mindfulness may reduce anxiety because it helps to cultivate one’s general positive attitude about the future which may challenge the diffuse worry and anticipatory fear that are inherent to anxiety. Future research should seek to further explore how to harness optimism in mindfulness treatments.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.
This study investigated the associations among acculturative family distancing in communication and values, family conflicts (parent-adolescent conflict, interparental conflict), and depressive symptoms and the mediating effects of family conflicts in the associations between acculturative family distancing in communication and values, and depressive symptoms in KA adolescents. Path analysis was used to analyze data from a cross-sectional survey of 339 Korean American adolescents (Mage = 14.99, SD = 1.67; 53% female) residing in New York City and New Jersey. Measurements include the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) Scale, Acculturative Family Distancing Youth Report Scale (AFD-YR), the Family Conflicts Scale (FCS), and the Children’s Perception of Interparental Conflict Scale. All path coefficients for the final model were statistically significant. There were significant mediating effects of parent-adolescent conflict and interparental conflict on the associations between acculturative family distancing in communication and values and depressive symptoms. The study suggests acculturative family distancing may be a contextual risk factor for depressive symptoms among KA youth. Additionally, greater acculturative family distancing may erode the strength and quality of family relationships. One of the objectives of this study was to test the AFD theory which identifies more problematic dimensions of intergenerational acculturation gap that increase risk for family conflict. The findings of the current study not only support but also build on the AFD theory by examining its relationship to both interparental and parent-adolescent conflicts.
This study aimed to observe contraceptive access, including types of contraceptives and level of use, among girls and young adults living in foster care following a state policy insurance change. This cohort study utilized linked, state administrative data to analyze child welfare and Medicaid claims data of 1641 female foster youth in Michigan. Oral tablets with a supply of 30 days before exhaustion was the most frequently prescribed contraceptive (77%), while injections, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) that have longer periods of use before exhaustion were rarely prescribed. Longer-term use products were prescribed with decreased frequency in the Medicaid Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) period than in the Medicaid Fee for Service (FFS) period. Foster youth placed in residential care experienced greater access to contraceptive care than those placed in family-based settings (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.63, 95% CI = (0.56–0.72)) and those living independently (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.55, 95% CI = (0.48–0.64)). Those in the largest urban county had less access (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.81, 95% CI = (0.71–0.92)) to contraceptives than those from other counties in the State. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.
This study examined the treatment efficacy of multiple family narrative therapy (MFNT) on psychological well-being and parent-child relationship among Chinese families of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Hong Kong. ADHD highly affects the academic performance of children and causes stress from its symptoms and medication side effects, while parents struggle to align their children’s needs with school and social expectations. Randomized control trial by site was adopted. A total of 61 families were randomized into the treatment group and the waitlist control group. Assessments were made at pre-intervention and post-intervention, and a 3-month follow-up assessment was made to assess the sustainability of the effects. Participants demonstrated significant reduction in parents’ psychological distress (p=.047), child-perceived parental rejection (p=.015), and paternal overprotection (p=.001). However, no significant results were observed on parental stress, guilt and shame, and parent-perceived parent-child relationships. As conventional support in Hong Kong for families raising children with ADHD primarily focuses on children’s behavioral performance, MFNT establishes crucial groundwork for promoting psychological well-being, addressing intrafamilial needs, and enhancing parent-child relationships through a shift in parental perceptions of ADHD. Limitations and recommendations for future studies are discussed.
The EEG theta band displays distinct roles in resting and task states. Low resting theta and transient increases in frontal-midline (fm) theta power during tasks are associated with better cognitive control, such as error monitoring. ADHD can disrupt this balance, resulting in high resting theta linked to drowsiness and low fm-theta activity associated with reduced cognitive abilities. Theta/beta ratio (TBR) neurofeedback aims to normalize resting state activity by downregulating theta, which could potentially unfavorably affect task-related fm-theta. This study examines the TBR neurofeedback’s impact on both resting and fm-theta activity, hypothesizing that remission depends on these effects. We analyzed data from a multi-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial with 142 children with ADHD and high TBR (ICAN study). Participants were randomized into experimental or sham NF groups. EEG measurements were taken at rest and during an Oddball task before and after neurofeedback, assessing global electrodes for resting theta and fm electrodes during error dynamics. Post-intervention changes were calculated as differences, and ANOVAs were conducted on GROUP, REMISSION, and CONDITION variables. Final analysis included fewer participants for all analyses. Resting state analysis showed no significant effects on global or fm-theta after TBR neurofeedback. Error dynamics analysis was inconclusive for global and fm-theta in both remitters and non-remitters. Results suggest that the current TBR neurofeedback protocol did not reduce aberrant resting state theta, and emphasize the need for refined protocols targeting specific theta-band networks to reduce resting-state theta without affecting fm-theta related to cognitive control.
Research highlights the critical role of physical activity for older adults, who generally understand its importance for health maintenance. However, the influence of interpersonal relationships on physical activity requires further exploration. This study aimed to retrospectively examine older adults’ perceptions of their physical activity across four life stages (i.e., early life, young adulthood, middle adulthood, and older adulthood) and to assess how interpersonal relationships impacted their exercise at each stage. Nineteen older adults (8 men, 11 women) aged 60 and older, who reported engaging in physical activity for at least 30 min one to seven times per week, participated in this study. Data were collected through online surveys and in-depth interviews. Four themes were constructed through Coding Reliability Thematic Analysis: (a) physical activity trajectory over lifespan, (b) family of origin influence on physical activity, (c) chosen relationships as facilitators and barriers to physical activity, and (d) impact of parenting and grandparenting on physical activity. Participants perceived various interpersonal relationships influenced their physical activity through different mechanisms: modeling (e.g., parents), co-participation (e.g., siblings, romantic partners, children, grandchildren, friends), or observing health challenges related to inactivity experienced by close relations (e.g., parents, siblings, extended family) at different points in their lives.
The focus of this pilot investigation was to determine if the EA Briefing (previously referred to as the EA Brief), could improve self-reported and observed emotional availability (EA) as well as maternal wellbeing. Participants in this study were mothers and their children, including infants, preschoolers, school-aged children, and adolescents. All assessments were administered prior to and at the end of the intervention. These assessments included the observational Emotional Availability (EA) Scales, the Emotional Availability Self-Report (EA-SR), and the Flourishing Scale. During the intervention, mother-child dyads were in their homes and filmed via Zoom. Each mother completed a single, short, individualized parent feedback and coaching session and received information about emotional availability, attachment, and mindfulness. Results examined differences between the groups and indicated that those who received the intervention showed more improvement in observed EA and self-reported EA than those who did not. Additionally, parent-child dyads of all age groups in the study demonstrated improvements. This suggests that the EA Briefing may be relevant for a wider age range of children than have previously participated. The study may also encourage other attachment-based interventions to examine their effectiveness with older children.
Research on men and masculinities is increasingly concerned with contemporary transformations in the way men understand and “do” gender. In particular, burgeoning paradigms like the hybrid masculinities framework have called attention to diverse patterns of practice among men that are seemingly at odds with traditional iterations of hegemonic masculinity. We conceptualize one component of this practice as a concerted process of “strategic masculine disinvestment.” Using new, nationally representative survey data pertaining to men living in the United States, we ask two novel questions about this phenomenon that have not been addressed at the population level. First,whodisinvests from traditional masculinity? While masculine distancing tends to be observed among privileged men in qualitative studies, a comprehensive view of which men engage in this practice within the general population is absent from the literature. Secondly, how are contemporary transformations of gender like strategic masculine disinvestment associated with psychosocial functioning? Findings suggest that strategic masculine disinvestment is more common among young and college educated men, but is not necessarily unique to unilaterally privileged men. In fact, men experiencing financial strain are especially likely to disinvest from masculinity. We also observe that strategic masculine disinvestment is consistently associated with poorer psychosocial functioning, including lower levels of mastery and higher levels of anger, anxiety, depression, and non-specific psychological distress. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for studies of men and masculinities and of contemporary transformations of gender more generally.
Sensory marketing recognizes the significance of physical experiences in product evaluation and consumer decision-making. This study examined the effects of model features in fashion advertising and consumer physical characteristics on consumer attitudes, drawing on embodied cognition theory. In Study 1, consumers completed a Go/NoGo task, recognition task, and product evaluation. Results showed that model position significantly affects consumer attitudes: right-handed people rated the right position better. Additionally, trait body image can influence this position effect. In Studies 2 and 3, we activated and manipulated state body image, respectively, and discovered the interactive effects of model position, model attractiveness, and consumer body image. Individuals with high body image responded positively to highly attractive models on the right, while those with low body image favored right-positioned less attractive models. These findings provide empirical evidence that body image shapes how people’s bodies interact with the world, and provide practical guidance for sensory marketing.
Digital parent training programs (DPTs) aimed at treating child behavior problems have shown efficacy in a number of trials, but less is known about the active ingredients parents find helpful while using DPTs. We analyzed data from users of self-guided DPTs within a randomized controlled trial setting: a standard program (DPT-STD) and an enhanced program (DPT-TP). Thematic analysis of interviews (n= 16) reveals that users of both programs endorsed the “content”, “content presentation”, “accessibility”, and “therapeutic context” as beneficial. However, only DPT-TP users identified the “therapeutic persuasiveness” as helpful, attributing this to features embedded exclusively in the enhanced program, including call-to-action reminders and assessment-based feedback. Findings were reinforced by the analysis of responses to open-ended questions from a larger sample of users (n= 31 DPT-STD users andn= 34 DPT-TP users). These findings underscore the importance of utilizing features that help parents make positive changes in their home.
This study examines how different green demarketing information types affect consumers’ brand evaluation and psychological processes. Based on three experiments conducted in China, our results reveal that specific claims have stronger effects on brand evaluations than vague claims. Additionally, specific (or vague) claims have a stronger indirect positive impact by stimulating environmental concern inferences and attitudes toward an ad when matched with loss (or gain) framing. Besides that, perceived environmental relevance of a product moderated this interaction effect, with specific claims using loss framing being more appropriate for high environmental relevance products, while low environmental relevance products are more appropriate for vague claims using gain framing. Therefore, green demarketing may significantly influence establishment of a favorable brand reputation and provide theoretical support for selecting and maximizing green demarketing strategies in the future.
The emergence of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has significantly impacted daily existence and affects not only respiratory functions but also psychological well-being and musculoskeletal health. Despite the considerable body of research examining the effects of COVID-19 on adults and older populations, the consequences on adolescents remain relatively underexplored. This study explored the COVID-19 impact on physical capacity, self-reported outcomes, and mental health in late adolescents who graduated from high school. The late adolescents were divided into recovered from mild COVID-19 (RFC,n= 68) group and healthy late adolescent controls without diagnosed COVID-19 (HC,n= 70) before. Physical capacity (shoulder flexor/abductor and elbow flexor/extensor muscle strength, back and leg power, and mobility), self-reported outcomes (kinesiophobia, emotional intelligence, and quality of life), and mental health were assessed. The mean follow-up of mild COVID-19 diagnosis in the RFC group was 12.20 ± 1.79 weeks. The results indicated a reduction in physical capacity among the RFC group compared to the HC group (p≤ 0.014). Furthermore, the RFC group exhibited higher levels of kinesiophobia (p= 0.001), lower quality of life (p< 0.05), and increased stress related to mental health (p= 0.004). However, it was noted that emotional intelligence was higher in the RFC group (p= 0.005). Mild COVID-19 adversely impacts physical capacity, life quality, kinesiophobia, and stress aspects of mental health in late adolescents. Thus, public health professionals and school administrators must recognize these consequences and collaboratively implement measures to improve physical activity levels through well-designed physical training programs and offer psychological support for late adolescents.
This study examined the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders among youth in Kumasi, Ghana, through a community-based cross-sectional survey. 672 urban participants aged 6–17 years were surveyed. Mental disorders were screened using Rutter’s A2 Scale for Parent Assessment of Child Behaviour, with diagnoses confirmed by the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. The Double Sampling method was used for weighted prevalence estimates, and correlates analysed using chi-square and logistic regression. Lifetime weighted prevalence of CAMH disorders was 30.4% (95% CI: 26.9–33.9), predominantly anxiety-related disorders, with current weighted prevalence 18.6% (95% CI: 15.7–21.5). Notably, lacking an active reading habit was associated with nearly three times the odds of mental illness. Children in the 3rd and 4th wealth quintiles had significantly higher odds of mental disorder (12- and 9-times increased odds, respectively), as did lack of caregiver homework supervision among children under 11 years. This study provides the first community-based prevalence figures for childhood mental disorders in Ghana, highlighting the link between poverty-related factors and mental health, and suggesting potential policy interventions to inform policy.
People use cues of facial gender typicality when making sexual orientation judgements, where gender typical faces (masculine men and feminine women) are more likely to be judged as heterosexual and gender atypical faces (feminine men and masculine women) are judged as non-heterosexual. Individual differences in the belief of associated stereotypes have been shown to influence how these stereotypes are used to make social judgments of others; therefore, across two studies, we tested whether the strength of beliefs in gender stereotypes impacted how facial gender typicality cues were used when making sexual orientation judgements. In both Study 1 and 2 (n= 283 and 219, respectively), participants made sexual orientation judgements of 80 faces (40 male, 40 female) that varied in gender typicality and completed a measure of belief in gender stereotypes. In Study 2, participants also completed a sexual prejudice measure. In line with predictions, both studies found that the strength in belief of gender stereotypes significantly moderated the use of facial gender typicality cues when making sexual orientation judgements. Participants with a greater belief in gender stereotypes were more likely to judge a face as heterosexual as gender typicality increased. In Study 2, the association between sexual prejudice and use of gender typicality cues was fully mediated by beliefs in gender role stereotypes. These results highlight the importance of considering individual differences of the perceiver and how they can interact with cues from a target, particularly when making sexual orientation judgements.
Prediction is known to play a role in language processing for monolingual as well as bilingual language users. Less understood is what happens when language users encounter mispredictions. While previous studies have shown that mispredictions result in reduced efficiency in language processing, it is unclear whether this is caused by abandoning the prediction and adopting the actual input, or by attempts to reconcile the prediction with the input. The present study investigated how language users from a varied language community manage misprediction in written and spoken English caused by incongruency between verb re-mention bias and pronominal reference. We predicted more pronoun repetition errors in incongruent contexts (Lisa annoys Peter because he...) compared to congruent contexts (Lisa annoys Peter because she...). We further asked whether language experience, operationalized as age of English acquisition and early bilingualism, modulates the management of mispredictions in this context. In three experiments, we used a novel adaptation of a sentence repetition paradigm focused on pronoun recall. English language users were presented with spoken or written sentence prompts, repeated them from memory, and produced continuations. We found that pronouns in congruent sentence prompts were repeated more accurately in both speech and writing compared to in incongruent ones, regardless of age of English acquisition and early bilingualism. These results reveal that re-mention biases affect how information is encoded and recalled. We argue that the results further suggest the occurrence of mispredictions on the discourse-level in English text and speech, which may have upstream consequences. Furthermore, these mispredictions are managed similarly in English by language users from vastly different language backgrounds.
IntroductionSexual choking has become prevalent among young U.S. adults. Little is known about how people learn about this sexual practice.MethodData are from a 2021 campus-representative confidential online survey of 4254 students at a large public U.S. university. We aimed to examine (a) where students had first learned about choking; (b) where they had learned the most about choking; (c) their perceptions of choking; and (d) how sources of learning were associated with perceptions of choking.ResultsThe top three sources of having first learned about choking were friends (35.1%), pornography (34.5%), and sexual partners (30.1%). Students reported learning the most about choking from partners (30.7%), friends (28.8%), and pornographic videos (25.1%). Most participants (88.9%) agreed/strongly agreed that people could die from being choked during sex, yet 37.5% endorsed choking as safe and half (49.6%) reported knowing how to engage in choking safely. Those who had learned the most about choking from other people more often agreed that choking was safe and that they know how to engage in choking safely. Those who had learned the most from media sources more often agreed with the importance of verbal consent, safe gestures, and being sober when engaging in choking.ConclusionYoung adults report learning about choking from varied sources which have implications for their perceptions of choking and its health consequences.Policy ImplicationsFindings have implications for sexuality educators (e.g., providing fact-based information about sexual choking to college students) and clinicians, who might consider anticipatory guidance on choking.
Sexual and gender diverse youth and young adults (SGDY) experience significant mental health disparities compared to non-SGDY and lack access to culturally responsive mental health supports. Limited literature on affirmative interventions for SGDY exists. As part of a larger pilot study, the present qualitative study sought to understand the experiences of SGDY who received the Tuned In! intervention to explore its potential benefit in supporting SGDY mental health. Tuned In! is a virtual affirmative mindfulness-based intervention, co-created with and for SGDY. SGDY (16–29 yrs.) were recruited from Connecticut to participate in the intervention via social media advertisements, and were invited to follow-up virtual focus groups after completing the intervention. Twenty-five SGDY participated in four virtual focus groups, with an additional 12 SGDY providing written feedback. The following overarching research questions guided this study: (1) What are the experiences of SGDY participating in the Tuned In! intervention? (2) What specific improvements are needed to provide enhanced support for SGDY participating in the Tuned In! intervention? Reflexive thematic analysis revealed three overarching themes: (1) mindfulness and self-compassion can support SGDY well-being, (2) spaces that cultivate SGDY community, and (3) the importance of diversity, safety, inclusion, and accessibility. Findings suggest Tuned In! can support SGDY mental health, which points to practical recommendations for future evaluation and implementation of affirmative mindfulness-based interventions for SGDY.
In contrast to the international context of residential care and the preference for family based care, residential care in Portugal is the only option for most young people in the child protection system. Despite this, research in Portugal has yet to focus on Therapeutic Residential Care (TRC) and has rarely considered the narratives of young people. By adopting the conceptual framework proposed by Farmer et al. (2017) and focusing on five critical domains (Setting, Staffing, Treatment Approach, Safety, and Milieu Factor), we aimed to identify a subset of factors that contribute to youth improvement. This convergent parallel mixed methods study involved conducting semi-structured interviews with 14 young people, mostly female (71%), aged 14–18 years (M= 16.3,SD= 1.8), at five TRC facilities in Portugal. Young people and staff also completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and the youth self-report or child behaviour checklist to assess internalising and externalising symptoms. Content analysis revealed mostly positive perceptions and experiences across the domains (Setting, Staffing, Treatment Approach, Safety, Milieu Factor and Profile Characteristics). However, half of the youth reported being vulnerable to peer contagion and females with higher internalising and externalising symptoms reported more negative perceptions and experiences of TRC. These findings highlight that creating an organisational social context that supports participatory approaches to assessing quality may provide invaluable insights into how services can be responsive to young people’s needs. Focusing on establishing high-quality relationships with staff, peers, family, and the community may be key to ensuring the long-term success of TRC.
This study aimed to examine associations of mental health symptoms with physical fitness indicators among Chinese college freshmen. 3667 Chinese college freshmen with an average age of 18.40 ± 0.81 were randomly recruited to participate in the cross-sectional study in 2017. Various physical fitness indicators were measured and overall physical fitness score was calculated according to the Chinese National Student Physical Fitness Standard. The total score of University Personality Inventory (UPI) and the depressive UPI score was measured via questionnaires to indicate overall mental health and depressive symptoms. We hypothesized that poor mental health status would associate with worse physical fitness. Multiple linear regressions and restricted cubic splines were adopted to assess the associations between UPI-measured mental health and physical fitness. The UPI-measured overall mental health was associated with several physical fitness indicators (e.g., 50-m sprint run [β= 0.0046,p= 0.023]) and total physical fitness score. Such associations were more significant within males and the only child. Overall physical fitness performance decreased rapidly when the total UPI score was greater than 10 points. Therefore, mental health problems among Chinese college freshmen are associated with poor physical fitness performance, especially for males and the only child. Interventions are urgent needs to provide for college freshmen who have depressive symptoms or get more than 10 points of the total UPI score. This article provides theoretical research guidance for students and schools to further prevent physical and mental problems simultaneously among college students.
The study aimed to develop and psychometrically test the Fertility Healthy Lifestyle Assessment Scale among the Turkish female/male population. This methodological study was conducted through an online survey with 526 participants (n= 340 women,n= 186 men) using the Google Forms tool between July 2020 and December 2021. The scale development process involved 4 steps: item generation, expert review and content validity, pilot study, and a field study with psychometric testing. The scale consisted of 46 items across seven sub-dimensions (emotional well-being, physical activity, sleep, nutrition, clothing/hygiene, use of technology, and spirituality). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the 7-factor structure of the Fertility Healthy Lifestyle Assessment Scale (factor loadings 0.33–0.99 according to CFA), and the fit indices of the scale (RMSEA = 0.067, GFI = 0.748, CFI = 0.924, IFI = 0.925, NNFI = 0.918 and NFI = 0.868) were found to be adequate. The seven sub-dimensions accounted for 71.25% of the total variance. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the total scale was 0.872, indicating strong internal consistency. As a result of the split into two analyses, Cronbach’s alpha value of the first half was 0.722 and the value of the second half was 0.780, with a correlation of 0.898 between the two halves. Our findings indicate that the Fertility Healthy Lifestyle Assessment Scale is a valid and reliable measurement for assessing healthy lifestyle habits with the purpose of enhancing fertility in women and men.
Academic engagement stands as a pivotal factor in fostering college students’ academic success and bolstering their competitiveness in the job market. However, college students are generally insufficiently invested in academic pursuits. Future time perspective (FTP) has been shown to be correlated to students’ academic engagement, and career adaptation is an essential competency for college students during the vocational transition phase. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the longitudinal relationship between FTP and academic engagement, and to explore the potential mediating role of career adaptability in this relationship. This three-wave longitudinal design included data from 259 first-year Chinese college students regarding their FTP, career adaptability, and academic engagement over six-month intervals (Time 1, October 2021; Time 2, April 2022; Time 3, October 2022). Cross-lagged models indicated that (1) FTP significantly and positively predicted subsequent academic engagement across all time points, (2) academic engagement significantly and positively predicted subsequent FTP across all time points, and (3) the relationship between FTP at Time 1 and academic engagement at Time 3 was mediated by career adaptability at Time 2. Thus, a significant temporal and bidirectional association exists between FTP and academic engagement with career adaptability as a mediator. These findings extend FTP and career construction theories to non-Western cultures and have implications for interventions targeting academic engagement and dropout rates.
IntroductionThis study analyzed the relationship between the social inclusion of LGBTI people and economic development. In this study, we have observed HDI and GDP per capita (PPP) in association with the LGBT + Rights and Inclusion Index for India from 1990 to 2022. The index accounts for microeconomic effects, whereas the controls account for the overall impact on the macroeconomic level.MethodsWe employ an OLS and robust least squares approach, in conjunction with the author’s developed “Inclusion Index” dataset, to examine the integration of LGBTI individuals into the Indian economy.ResultsIndia’s Inclusion Index scores 0.51 out of 1. Further, our study finds that an additional point on the LGBT + Rights scale of legal rights is associated with an increase in GDP per capita (PPP) of approximately $668 and a 0.035 increase in HDI value. Additionally, integrating the LGBTI community into the health, education, personal safety, and violence aspects of the Inclusion Index increases the GDP per capita (PPP) by about 0.608%, according to the approximation.ConclusionsCombining the in-depth, subjective information on the actual experiences of LGBTI individuals with the broader statistical modeling leads to a compatible outcome—there exists an apparent relationship between LGBTI inclusiveness and the development of the economy.Policy Implications.By promoting LGBTI inclusivity on the microeconomic spectrum, specifically through the Inclusion Index’s dimensions, we can foster wholesome inclusivity that aligns with the macroeconomic spectrum, particularly the variables examined in the study.
A premise of statistical learning research is that learners attend to and learn the frequencies of co-occurring sounds in the input, or phonotactic sequences. Inherent to the concepts of both frequency and phonotactics is order, or the temporal arrangement of the relevant elements. Order is similarly inherent to statistical learning, yet the effect of order on statistical learning is not well understood. In the present study, adult participants learned the relative frequencies of eight consonant sequences, for example, /mk/ and /st/ in the nonwords /nʌmkət/ and /gɪstək/. Both familiarization and test stimuli were independently ordered and randomized, thus allowing for a relatively broad search for order effects in an established statistical learning paradigm. Participants learned the target frequencies equivalently across the five ordering conditions, indicating no modulating effect of order. Nevertheless, the results reflect an initial pass at further integration of statistical learning with existing research on the effects of order in memory and general cognition. (155 words).
Based on the assumption that language influences thinking, the present study investigated the effect of gender-fair language in German, a grammatically gendered language among primary school children. Specifically, in a single-study experiment, we compared 218 German third and fourth graders on the effects of the generic masculine (e.g.,der Polizist; English:the policeman) and gender-fair language in terms of the feminine and masculine form (e.g.,die Polizistin/der Polizist; English:the policewoman/the policeman) on the cognitive representation of women in stereotypically masculine occupations and occupational self-efficacy. General self-efficacy was examined as a moderator variable, assumed to influence the effect of gender-fair language on occupational self-efficacy. The results indicate that the gender-fair form led to a higher cognitive representation of women in stereotypically masculine occupations for girls and increased girls’ occupational self-efficacy for stereotypically masculine occupations. In contrast, the use of gender-fair language did not significantly influence boys’ cognitive representation of women and their occupational self-efficacy. General self-efficacy did not affect the effect of gender-fair language on occupational self-efficacy. Thus, even as early as in primary school, gender-fair language could help attracting girls to stereotypically masculine occupations.
The present study aims to extend knowledge on the relationship between humor styles, optimism and quality of life by employing the typological approach. Therefore, humor profiles were examined as patterns of humor styles and compared within profiles. The sample of 725 respondents from Spanish community was tested using Humor Styles Questionnaire, Life Orientation Test – Revised and the 12-Item Short Form Survey. Initial insight into the relations between humor styles, optimism and quality of life was provided using correlations controlling for gender, age, and socio-economic status, showing that optimism and quality of life measures correlated positively with affiliative and self-enhancing humor, and negatively with self-defeating humor styles. Four humor profiles (humor enhancers, endorsers, deniers and detrimenters) were identified using latent profile analysis, with the pairwise comparisons between the profiles in the analysis of differences in optimism and quality of life. Results revealed higher optimism and quality of life at humor profiles whose members use positive humor styles compared to profiles whose members use only negative humor styles, or do not use any kind of humor. In addition, significant role of gender, age and socio-economic position on observed relationship were confirmed. Advantages of typological approach in research of humor styles were discussed.
This study utilized latent class growth modeling (LCGM) to identify four kinds of math achievement trajectories across grades 4–6. In addition latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to Identify four motivational profiles in grade 4. We also examined the relation between these math achievement trajectories and motivational profiles. Data were collected from 3,772 children. Results showed that only children in the “high quality” motivation profile had greater probabilities of following favorable math achievement developmental patterns. This result indicated that motivation quality is more important than the amount of motivation not only for children’s current academic achievement but also for their academic developmental trajectories in the long term.
In Korea, parents of children with developmental disabilities (DDs) face significant societal stigma, negatively affecting their mental well-being and quality of life. Accepting a child’s disability significantly impacts family psychosocial dynamics and long-term planning. This study aimed to uncover factors affecting disability acceptance among these parents using a mixed methods sequential exploratory approach. We interviewed eight South Korean parents of children with DDs aged 5–35 and analyzed their responses to identify factors promoting or hindering acceptance. The analysis identified factors like emotion regulation, family support, religious activities, and societal perception. We the identified factors, we conducted a quantitative study of 200 parents of children aged 3–40, collaborating with the National Association of Parents of Disabled Children and an online community. The analysis indicated that positive emotion regulation promoted acceptance, while negative emotions and societal stigma hindered it. Family support was crucial, but peer or expert support showed minimal impact. The study emphasizes the importance of emotion regulation, family support, and societal awareness. Further studies should focus on refining interventions based on these findings.
Some evidence indicates that a person’s attitude towards emotion (ATE; measured as liking/disliking of a discrete emotion) predicts the person’s situation selection (e.g., choice of emotional images), which is an essential part of emotion regulation. Would the association between ATE and stimulus selection be generalized to other types of ATE and stimuli? This study aimed to examine whether implicit and explicit fear of emotion (i.e., fear of experiencing an emotion due to concerns about losing control over the emotion) would predict the avoidance of emotion-inducing music. Seventy-three female university students, among whom approximately one third showed mild or above depressive symptoms, reported implicit and explicit fear of positive emotion and depression. Participants also completed the music choice task in which they were presented with a pair of emotional music excerpts and chose one they preferred to listen to. Results showed that those with greater implicit fear of positive emotion avoided the choice of high-arousal happiness-inducing music excerpts, particularly when the music was paired with high-arousal sadness and neutral-inducing excerpts. These results emphasise the need to consider both implicit and explicit processes, as well as arousal and valence, in understanding the role of fear of emotion in situation selection.
The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) within organizational processes has profound implications for employee creativity and organizational innovation. This study examines how AI adoption influences employee creativity through the mediating role of creative self-efficacy, and how transformational leadership moderates this relationship. By integrating social cognitive theory and social exchange theory, we hypothesize that AI adoption enhances employee creativity, primarily through increased creative self-efficacy. Furthermore, we posit that transformational leadership strengthens the positive impact of AI adoption on creative self-efficacy, thereby amplifying its effect on creativity. By collecting three-wave time-lagged data from a final sample of 236 full-time working adults in South Korea, our findings provide robust support for the proposed hypotheses. AI adoption was positively associated with employee creativity and creative self-efficacy. Creative self-efficacy, in turn, significantly predicted employee creativity and mediated the relationship between AI adoption and creativity. Additionally, transformational leadership moderated the relationship between AI adoption and creative self-efficacy, with stronger effects observed under high transformational leadership conditions. These results offer significant theoretical and practical contributions by integrating AI adoption with creativity and leadership research, highlighting the crucial roles of psychological mechanisms and leadership dynamics in fostering innovation.
Leaders often find themselves in complex situations in which they must navigate competing and contradictory demands. Consequently, leaders often experience ambivalence. While followers pay close attention to leaders and use their leaders’ behaviors and emotions as cues for modeling their own behavior, there is little empirical work exploring how followers perceive leader ambivalence and how these perceptions affect followers. Therefore, in three studies (totalN= 879), we examined whether perceiving leader ambivalence could facilitate followers’ willingness to speak up. We also investigated the underlying mechanism of this effect, testing whether perceptions of leader ambivalence led to inferences of both higher leader cognitive flexibility and responsiveness, which then would increase the likelihood that followers speak up. In line with our hypotheses, followers showed a greater willingness to speak up when perceiving an ambivalent leader than a non-ambivalent leader. This effect was serially mediated by perceptions of both increased leader cognitive flexibility and responsiveness. Study 3 also showed that when followers perceived an ambivalent leader, they expected fewer negative consequences when speaking up about a variety of issues (e.g., response to dissatisfaction). We discuss the implications of our findings for future research on ambivalence in leadership and organizational contexts.
This article calls for expanding the conceptualization of school attendance problems (SAPs). It offers a hermeneutic phenomenological exploration using the youth’s lived experiences. Attention is paid to bodily reactions and emotions in student narratives. Our goal is to aid research on prolonged absences from school by promoting studies that encourage teachers to investigate school cultures and climates. School personnel are essential in preventing and handling classroom SAPs and creating situated pathways among stakeholders. We interviewed nine students to learn about barriers and facilitators to school attendance. We used quotes from the interviews to make goals for understanding SAPs in schools. Using poetic inquiry as a qualitative method, we offer an aesthetic perspective to understand SAPs. The poems attempt to capture youth’s nonverbal experiences with prolonged school absences. The results provide insights into youth, schools, and professionals regarding the connection between hope and SAPs. The role of hope is essential for students’ continuing education. Additionally, our results emphasize the need to include factors of belonging within the learning environment for early intervention, thereby increasing attendance, motivation, and long-term engagement in future education.
In response to Oman’s “Mindfulness for Global Public Health: Critical Analysis and Agenda” call for greater integration of mindfulness into global public health, this commentary proposes three complementary approaches: examining core psychological mechanisms of mindfulness, understanding its developmental progression, and implementing artificial intelligence (AI) technology to enhance accessibility. The commentary reviews some contemporary theoretical models of mindfulness to identify fundamental psychological mechanisms. Analysis included examination of mindfulness developmental progression (skill to state to trait) and exploration of artificial intelligence applications, specifically large language models (LLMs), in enhancing intervention delivery and accessibility. The identified psychological mechanisms—attention regulation and non-judgemental acceptance—represent fundamental psychological processes that transcend cultural differences, addressing Oman’s concerns about epidemiologic foundations (Axis A6) and cultural adaptability (Axis A10). Analysis of developmental progression revealed how mindfulness evolves from learned skill to psychological trait, informing implementation strategies. Analysis of LLM applications demonstrated potential for addressing equity concerns (Axis A9) through increasing accessibility among underserved populations while enabling culturally responsive adaptations. By examining mindfulness through its core psychological mechanisms, developmental progression, and AI-enabled delivery approaches, this commentary provides perspectives to address some challenges of global implementation identified by Oman. The mechanistic approach strengthens empirical foundations of mindfulness while supporting cultural adaptability, and emerging AI technologies present unprecedented opportunities to increase accessibility. However, realising this potential requires careful attention to ethical considerations and continued empirical validation of AI-supported mindfulness interventions.
Two main ways to enter a marriage are through free choice and through an arrangement between families, known as an arranged marriage. In this study, we compared differences in three dimensions of love (Intimacy, Passion, and Commitment) between spouses in love-based marriages and arranged marriages among five non-Western societies: Bhotiya from the Himalayas, Igbo from Nigeria, Kimeru from Kenya, Meru from Tanzania, and Tsimane’ from Bolivia. When considering all data gathered from the five cultures, free choice and arranged marriages did not differ significantly in average love scores. However, within cultures, some differences did emerge between free choice and arranged marriages, such as spouses from free choice marriages from Bhotiya and Tsimane’ culture showing higher levels of Intimacy than those from arranged marriages. However, in the Bhotiya, this difference was only evident in marriages lasting longer than 10 years. Moreover, spouses from free choice marriages from Bhotiya reported higher levels of passion, while spouses from free choice marriages from Tsimane’ reported higher levels of commitment than individuals from arranged marriages. Conversely, wives from arranged marriages from Meru culture from Tanzania reported higher levels of Intimacy and Passion as compared to wives from free choice marriages. In Kimeru and Igbo, no significant differences were found. These results contribute to the growing body of literature on the relationship between culture, love, and marriage. Our data also challenge the Western perception that arranged marriages lack love.
Schoolteachers are a profession at high risk for workplace burnout. The Jobs Demands-Resource model is useful in understanding burnout in this population. However, a better understanding of what psychological and physiological factors serve as demands and resources, and how these might interact to predict burnout is needed. In this study, we obtained cardiac activity (Heart Rate Variability) over a working day, as well as self-reported stress and psychological measures of self-compassion, self-criticism, emotional exhaustion and dysregulation, depersonalisation, self-reassurance and personal accomplishment in a sample of 57 primary school staff. A logistic regression analysis identified self-compassion (OR= 12.91, 95%CI= 1.62–180.74) and self-criticism (OR= 1.25, 95%CI= 1.07–1.56) to be most strongly related to differences in Heart Rate Variability (root mean square of successive differences) between self-reported rest periods and periods of high stress. In addition, a mediation analysis revealed self-criticism was a significant predictor of the depersonalisation facet of burnout (z= 2.16,p= .03), whereas results for self-compassion were more complex and were mediated by physiological coping (i.e., Heart Rate Variability) (z= 2.60,p= .009). In the context of the Job Demands-Resources Model, we conclude that self-compassion can serve as an additional resource that can protect individuals in high-stress and demanding roles. Additionally, we recommend future research investigates compassion-focused interventions as part of institutional efforts to manage workplace stress and help ameliorate burnout in high-risk professional groups.
This research aimed to examine a theoretical model that state boredom leads to a motivation to seek meaningfulness, which promotes the engagement of social comparison. We conducted six studies to test our hypothesis. Study 1a, Study 1b, and Study 2 found that state boredom increased social comparison preference. Study 3 promoted ecological validity by adopting actual social comparison information-seeking behavior. Meanwhile, an alternative explanation that state boredom increased information preference regardless of content was ruled out. Study 4 verified motivation to seek meaningfulness as the psychological mechanism underlying the effect and found that people with different self-construals differed in the amount of increase in the sense of meaningfulness obtained from social comparison. Study 5 adopted a moderation-of-process design to further verify the mediating role of motivation to seek meaningfulness. In conclusion, our findings reveal the impact of state boredom on social comparison and its underlying mechanisms, which contributes to the further understanding of state boredom.
COVID-19 caused a sudden shift for counselors-in-training and supervisors to transition from in-person counselling to telehealth counseling and supervision. Counselors-in-training and supervisors at large were forced to complete a rapid transition to telehealth. This article provides a detailed account of the transition made at a large Southeastern University to telehealth and takes a broader look at practical implications and recommendations that other university and/or college and community-based clinics can use for adding telehealth to their clinic. In addition, practices for the effective use of technology in professional counselors’ preparedness for in person and telehealth counseling and supervision are outlined.
Anxiety symptoms is prevalent among college students and is associated with a range of detrimental consequences. Self-compassion and emotion regulation difficulties are important factors affecting anxiety symptoms, but their functional mechanism and longitudinal correlation are still unclear. This three-year longitudinal study (baseline:n= 5785, 48.2% of female,Mage= 18.63 years,SD= 0.88; T1to T5:n= range from 4312 to 5497) aimed to validate the emotion regulation model of self-compassion by examining the associations between self-compassion, emotion regulation difficulties, and anxiety symptoms. Random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) was used to distinguish within-person variations overtime from stable between-person differences. The results obtained from the RI-CLPMs indicated that there is a bidirectional effect between self-compassion and anxiety symptoms at the within-person level. Emotional regulation difficulties played a longitudinal mediating role in the prediction from self-compassion to anxiety symptoms at the within-person level, validating the emotion regulation model of self-compassion. The current study indicates that cultivating self-compassion in college students is crucial as it can improve their emotion regulation skills and alleviate anxiety symptoms.
Although numerous studies have investigated the psychological outcomes of peer victimization, little is known about differences in the negative effects of traditional victimization and cyber victimization, especially among left-behind and non-left-behind adolescents in rural China. We aimed to examine a model explaining how traditional victimization and cyber victimization influence suicidal ideation mediated by emotional distress in rural China, with left-behind status as a moderator. Data were collected via random, multistage, stratified-cluster sampling in schools in a rural region of Hunan province, China. The sample included 697 adolescents in Grades 7–9 (boys = 53.8%). Structural equation modeling and multigroup comparison analysis were performed to test a pre-formulated conceptual model. In the full sample, both traditional and cyber victimization were associated with students’ emotional distress, which was also associated with suicidal ideation. Among left-behind adolescents, only traditional victimization was associated with emotional distress and suicidal ideation. For non-left-behind adolescents, both traditional victimization and cyber victimization were significantly associated with emotional distress, and cyber victimization’s association with emotional distress was even slightly stronger than traditional victimization’s. Our study expands the current understanding of the differential effects of traditional and cyber victimization among subgroups of children. The findings further suggest that the focus should not be solely on left-behind children; the psychological health of non-left-behind children also warrants attention. Additionally, the study provides considerable implications for practice.
Background and ObjectiveWorkplace sexual harassment (WSH) has become a serious and widespread workplace problem. One of the reasons why sexual harassment (SH) remains a challenging problem is that it is under-reported. In this study, we review the existing qualitative research surrounding this phenomenon in all workplaces, paying particular attention to barriers to reporting WSH.DesignQualitative meta-synthesis.Data SourcesDatabases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were searched to identify qualitative studies. Only articles published in English were eligible for inclusion criteria; however, no time limit was imposed. The primary data analysis included people’s experiences of reporting SH and its barriers in the workplace. Data collection was conducted from February 2023 to September 2023.MethodsThis meta-synthesis was conducted following three steps: (i) identifying published articles for inclusion and exclusion criteria, (ii) quality appraisal and data extraction, and (iii) summarizing and synthesis.ResultsThe search retrieved 6065 articles, and based on the current research question and selection criteria, a total of 237 full texts were selected to enter the research. Eventually, 44 articles were selected based on the PRISMA (2020) method. Five factors were identified as barriers to reporting WSH: uncertainty of receiving legal support from the organization, the influence of reporting on employment conditions, lack of support from people around, being worried about tarnishing the social image, and internal inhibitors.ConclusionUnderstanding the experiences of women and men who are victims of WSH can help employers, managers, and all those who are somehow involved in improving the safety of the workplace. We found that regardless of what culture people belong to, they have common experiences in reporting SH. Establishing specific rules and protocols, monitoring their implementation, and raising awareness among employees and managers through training may help reduce incidents of WSH to some extent.
Teachers are leaving the profession at a staggering rate. This is especially true for teachers of students with emotional and behavioral disorders. By targeting students’ social and emotional skills, teachers could see major improvements in student behavior. However, teachers lack adequate preservice training and ongoing professional development in behavioral management and are therefore underequipped to manage behavioral challenges, leading to higher stress and affecting attrition. One proposed remedy is better instructional supports for teachers in the classroom. In this commentary we outline the current challenges surrounding the provision of quality social and emotional instruction in schools. We argue that teachers need access to comprehensive, structured programs to provide individualized instruction on social and emotional skills. Results of a pilot study are shared, and future directions are explored.
Occupational burnout is a concern for the health of clergy and musicians and the longevity of their careers. However, no known study has assessed occupational burnout among pastoral musicians in the United States. Therefore, the aims of this paper were to (1) describe pastoral musicians as a population, (2) identify the prevalence rate of burnout among pastoral musicians, and (3) investigate the relationship between pastoral musicians’ burnout and religious coping. In 2021, an online questionnaire designed to assess burnout among pastoral musicians was disseminated via email to members of the Hymn Society of North America and via social media to collect data from pastoral music directors in the United States. The survey yieldedN= 1,050 respondents. Of these, 83.8% experienced one or more symptoms of burnout (41.3% with low efficacy; 12.4% with high emotional exhaustion; 21.3% with high cynicism; 8.8% with burnout). Ineffectiveness was positively correlated with negative religious coping. Emotional exhaustion and cynicism were positively correlated with negative religious coping. This study contributes quantitative analysis to pastoral musician research. Findings demonstrate that burnout is prevalent among American pastoral musicians. More research is needed to investigate solutions for burnout among this population.Keywords: church musician, performance-related health problems (PRHPs), clergy, musicians’ health, performing arts health, burnout.
The extant research has primarily investigated the negative effect of differentiated empowering leadership (DEL) on either the individual or team-level outcomes, revealing little about the positive influence of DEL and rarely considering the dual-level effects. According to the legitimacy perspective, the performance basis is identified as a crucial factor in enabling DEL to confer benefits to the entire team and individual members simultaneously. Furthermore, the boundary effects of team-member exchange (TMX) and employee self-efficacy on the moderating process were examined. The cross-hierarchy and hierarchical regression methods were employed to analyze the multisource data from 78 Chinese teams. The findings revealed that (1) for the effect on the whole team, DEL was positively related to team identification when highly based on employee job performance, and the effect was stronger in the team with higher-quality team-member exchange; (2) for the effect on individual members, the relation between performance-based DEL and employee work engagement was positive for the high self-efficacy members but negative for the low self-efficacy members. These findings underscore the importance of DEL basis, team, and individual contexts for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of DEL.
Parental overprotection is thought to be a risk factor for childhood anxiety disorders. The Parental Overprotection Measure (POM) is a self-assessment scale that has been used in many studies, however, no article has comprehensively explored its psychometric properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the POM to secure reliable, replicable, and comparable results. Using an item-response theoretical framework, we aimed to address five basic criteria of psychometric quality: one-dimensionality, ordered response categories, invariance, targeting, and reliability. Furthermore, we aimed to identify and exclude any items that did not contribute significantly, to create a concise and practical scale. A total of 1092 parents of children aged 4–12 years were recruited through an online advertisement and completed an anonymous online survey during September and October 2020. Out of the 19 items of the original scale, eight were excluded due to unsatisfactory psychometric properties and/or because of not being judged by experts as harmonious with the concept of parental overprotection. The retained items constituted the POM-11, a brief scale with sound psychometric properties that has the potential for use in both research and clinical settings.

The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between the victim-perpetrator educational gap and the type of violence exerted within a sample of perpetrators, as well as to explore whether this relationship is mediated by distorted thoughts about women, attitudes toward the use of violence, and empathy. A total of 466 men convicted of an intimate partner violence-related crime were divided into two groups: Group EL < V (perpetrators with a lower educational level than the victim) and Group EL > V (perpetrators with a higher educational level than the victim). Mediation analyses were conducted using distorted thoughts about women, attitudes toward violence, and empathy as mediators. Perpetrators with a lower educational level than their partner exerted greater physical, psychological, and sexual violence compared to those with a higher educational level, but only when mediated by distorted thoughts about women and empathy. These findings have significant implications for both intervention programs and prevention strategies.
Objectives: A network analysis was used to examine the relationship between childhood abuse and Machiavellian traits in different genders. This has not been done before. Methods: The study recruited Chinese university students; 1,285 students completed questionnaires measuring childhood abuse and Machiavellianism. Network analysis was done using R Studio. Results: The results of the study indicate that 75.9% of participants abused met the criteria for one type of child abuse. Two examined constructs (i.e., childhood abuse and Machiavellianism) were interconnected in the females’ and males’ networks. The results showed negative relationships between physical neglect/ emotional neglect and desire for status (PN-Dst, EN-Dst), and a positive correlation between emotional abuse and desire for status (EA-Stt) in both genders. Unique to female networks is the link between emotional abuse and distrust (EA-Dst), while physical neglect was associated with distrust (PN-Dst) in females and with control (PN-Cnt) in males. Sexual/ physical abuse was related to control desire (SA-Cnt, PA-Cnt) in females only. The link between amorality and emotional abuse or neglect (EA-Amr, EN-Amr) was showed in females. In contrast, amorality in males is associated with physical abuse (PA-Amr). Conclusion: The results demonstrate the utility of a network approach in modeling the correlational structure of childhood abuse and Machiavellianism. It identifies key factors and communities within the network while also measuring the strength and direction of symptom ties, and provides novel insights into gender differences.
Autonomy-supportive parenting benefits adolescents’ psychosocial adjustment, but daily fluctuations in adolescent difficulties and parenting stress can reduce autonomy support and lead to more controlling practices. However, currently it is not yet well understood why some parents seem better able to deal with the daily upheavals characteristic of adolescence, while other parents may resort to controlling practices. To address this gap, the present studies examined the moderating role of parental reflective functioning (i.e., parents’ capacity to understand their adolescent’s behavior in terms of mental states) in the daily relationships between adolescent difficulties, parental stress, and autonomy-supportive or controlling parenting. Two 7-day diary studies were conducted, of which Study 1 involved 220 parents of early adolescents (Mage= 13.05 years,SD= 0.87, range 10–15, 66% female) and Study 2 involved 161 parents of middle adolescents (Mage= 15.56 years,SD= 1.14, range = 13–18, 61.5% female). Multilevel analyses indicated that daily perceived externalizing difficulties and parental stress were associated with less autonomy-supportive and more controlling parenting. Furthermore, prementalizing (i.e., attributing malevolent intentions to adolescents) predicted less autonomy support and more controlling parenting. Greater interest and curiosity about adolescents’ mental states buffered the associations between middle adolescents’ (internalizing and externalizing) difficulties and parent-reported controlling parenting. These findings highlight the role of both parent and adolescent characteristics in day-to-day parenting fluctuations and underscore the importance of parental reflective functioning in understanding variations in autonomy-supportive and controlling practices.
Despite long-standing concerns about the use of free reaction times (RTs) in cognitive psychology, they remain a prevalent measure of conflict resolution. This report presents the forced-response method as a fresh approach to examine speed–accuracy trade-off functions (SATs) in conflict tasks. The method involves fixing the overall response time, varying the onset of stimuli, and observing response expression. We applied this method to an arrow flanker task. By systematically varying the time between stimulus onset and response, we reveal a comprehensive time course of the flanker interference effect that is rarely observed in previous literature. We further show that influential manipulations observed in free-RT paradigms similarly affect accuracy within the forced-response technique, suggesting that the forced-response method retains the core cognitive processing characteristics of traditional free-RT conflict tasks. As a behavioral method that examines the time course of cognitive processing, the forced-response method provides a novel and more nuanced look into the dynamics of conflict resolution.
Eye tracking technology has become increasingly prevalent in scientific research, offering unique insights into oculomotor and cognitive processes. The present article explores the relationship between scientific theory, the research question, and the use of eye-tracking technology. It aims to guide readers in determining if eye tracking is suitable for their studies and how to formulate relevant research questions. Examples from research on oculomotor control, reading, scene perception, task execution, visual expertise, and instructional design are used to illustrate the connection between theory and eye-tracking data. These examples may serve as inspiration to researchers new to eye tracking. In summarizing the examples, three important considerations emerge: (1) whether the study focuses on describing eye movements or uses them as a proxy for e.g., perceptual, or cognitive processes, (2) the logical chain from theory to predictions, and (3) whether the study is of an observational or idea-testing nature. We provide a generic scheme and a set of specific questions that may help researchers formulate and explicate their research question using eye tracking.
The use of research-informed and evidence-based practices (RI/EBPs) in classroom and behavior management can help teachers mitigate challenging student behavior in their classrooms, while also improving the academic achievement for those students. However, research suggests teachers lack the knowledge and skills to implement these practices. The purpose of this study was to gain insight of one mid-Atlantic school districts (1) access, preparation, and training in the use of RI/EBPs in classroom and behavior management and (2) the experiences of their teachers with RI/EBPs in classroom and behavior management. Data were analyzed based on a cross-sectional survey design. Results indicated participants had limited access, preparation, and training in RI/EBPs in classroom and behavior management; however, some variation did occur. In addition, results were promising relative to our participants’ experiences with RI/EBPs in classroom and behavior management. Limitations, implications for future research, and implications for practice are discussed.
Understanding the neuroanatomy of schizophrenia remains elusive due to heterogeneous findings across neuroimaging studies. Here we investigated whether patterns of brain atrophy associated with schizophrenia would localize to a common brain network using a coordinate network mapping meta-analysis approach. Utilizing the human connectome as a wiring diagram, we identified a connectivity pattern, a schizophrenia network, uniting heterogeneous results from 90 published studies of atrophy in schizophrenia (totaln> 8,000). This network was specific to schizophrenia, differentiating it from atrophy in individuals at high risk for psychosis (n= 3,038), normal aging (n= 4,195), neurodegenerative disorders (n= 3,707) and other psychiatric conditions (n= 3,432). The network was also stable with disease progression and across different clusters of schizophrenia symptoms. Patterns of brain atrophy in schizophrenia were negatively correlated with lesions linked to psychosis-related thought processes in an independent cohort (n= 181). Our results propose a unique, stable, and unified schizophrenia network, addressing a significant portion of the heterogeneity observed in previous atrophy studies.
We explore the intricate associations among job insecurity, psychological contract breach (PCB), job stress, ethical leadership, and pro-environmental behavior at work (PEBW) within South Korean organizations. Using a 4-wave time-lagged design and data from 220 employees of South Korean companies, analyzed through structural equation modeling, the research investigates how job insecurity impacts PEBW via the sequential mediating role of PCB and job stress. Additionally, it examines the moderating role of ethical leadership within this context. The findings reveal that job insecurity significantly increases psychological contract breach, which subsequently elevates job stress and ultimately reduces PEBW. These results highlight the necessity of addressing job insecurity to prevent negative impacts on employee attitudes and behaviors. Moreover, the study demonstrates that ethical leadership effectively buffers the detrimental influences of unstable jobs on PCB, emphasizing the significance of ethical leadership in building a supportive and trusting environment. The study contributes to the theoretical discourse by integrating insights from Social Exchange Theory, Conservation of Resources theory, the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Equity Theory, and leadership theories, thereby providing a comprehensive perspective to understand the antecedents of PEBW. Practically, the results provide actionable perspectives for organizations aiming to enhance sustainability. By mitigating job insecurity, managing psychological contract breaches and job stress, and fostering ethical leadership, organizations can enhance employee engagement in pro-environmental behaviors. Overall, this research offers significant theoretical and practical contributions, providing a nuanced understanding of how job insecurity affects PEBW and informing strategies to cultivate a sustainable organizational environment.
At an early age, humans learn words to communicate their affective states and generalize their identification across differing external conditions. One might call this collection of effects emotion labeling. Previous research investigating analogous effects in nonverbal animal models has largely used drug-induced affective states or metacognitive states that are difficult to control. Some progress has been made by conceptualizing affect as a point within a two-dimensional space with pleasure on one axis and arousal on the other. Distinct affective states may thus serve as cues that control both human and non-human behavior. If conditions supporting responding produce distinct affect, labeling in one circumstance may transfer to novel conditions that elicit the same affective state. The present experiment examined the labeling of affective states induced in pigeons via outcomes of either the delivery of food or its omission. These outcomes followed responses (pecks) made in the presence of three visual stimuli (A,B, andC). OnAtrials, each outcome was followed by two labels; pecks to one of two labels, depending on whether food was delivered or omitted, were required to progress to the next trial. All pigeons labeled accurately. Consistent with human emotion labeling, pigeons learned to select a label associated with different core affect-inducing outcomes, transferred appropriately to novel conditions (i.e., trials withBandCin Test 1 and 2), and probably relied on more than just external cues (Test 3).
IntroductionResearch from sub-Saharan Africa has shown that women’s relationships and partners influence their contraceptive use. Most relevant studies focus on relationship status with few considering how the quality of a relationship might influence women’s use of contraceptives. This study is the first to examine how both positive and negative relationship dynamics are associated with young women’s modern contraceptive use among those who want to postpone pregnancy for at least 2 years or stop childbearing altogether.MethodsWe analyze survey data collected in 2010 and 2011 from 745 young women aged 16–26 in partnerships in southern Malawi. The data include positive relationship dynamics such as expressions of love, communication, and partner support (relationship unity) and negative dynamics including unequal power and intimate partner violence.ResultsLogistic regression models show that relationship unity is significantly and positively associated with modern contraceptive use whereas negative relationship dynamics are not associated with contraceptive use among the sample. When stratified by relationship status, model results show the effects are driven by unmarried women.ConclusionsResults suggest that positive relationship dynamics among unmarried couples can facilitate modern contraceptive use among those who want to avoid pregnancy.Policy ImplicationsEfforts to encourage partner communication and support surrounding the use of contraception, and expanding access to a variety of modern methods, may be beneficial for reducing unintended pregnancies and enhancing unmarried young women’s reproductive autonomy to meet their contraceptive and fertility desires.
Educational programs in which people are exposed to counter-stereotypical role models are often used for breaking gender stereotypes. Most gender role-model interventions focus on adolescents and emerging adults. Yet, middle childhood might be a highly effective period for changing gender stereotypes because children are still learning about gender and gender roles. Hence, in this mixed-methods study aformative evaluation was conducted on the usability and acceptability of a new educational program (Heroines!) with diverse counter-stereotypical female heroines that was developed for children aged 6–12 years. Ten Dutch teachers (90% women) who utilized the Heroines program in their classes completed the System Usability Scale and were interviewed (semi-structured) on several indicators of usability and acceptability. Overall, the usability and acceptability of the Heroines program was high according to teachers both in the survey and the interviews. Perceived effectiveness, users’ affective attitudes, perceived burden, and ethicality were evaluated most positively. Intervention coherence and teacher self-efficacy were evaluated somewhat lower. The program also elicited some resistance among boys because of its sole focus on women. To conclude, to increase intervention coherence and teacher’s self-efficacy for working with the intervention, it is recommended to create a clear link between the central character traits of the heroines and the traits that are practiced by children in the accompanying exercises. In order to increase acceptability of the program for boys teachers need to explain the importance of the focus on female role models.
This study applied intergroup contact theory to explore professional counselors’ attitudes toward diversity and the influence of intergroup interactions on their professional practice. Using a transcendental phenomenological approach, the qualitative analysis, consisting of interviews across eight participants, identified six key themes: personal growth, professional development, impact of intergroup contact, advocacy and social justice, influence of graduate training programs, and strategies for effective intergroup contact. The findings highlight the need for counselor education programs to integrate structured intergroup contact experiences to enhance multicultural competence among trainees. Recommendations for educators include incorporating diverse social interactions and experiential learning opportunities within training programs to foster positive attitudes toward diversity and improve counseling effectiveness.
ObjectivesThe positive relationship between dispositional mindfulness and pro-environmental behaviour has been often attributed to increased ecological concern and behavioural regulation. However, research on how mindfulness might influence pro-environmental behaviour via enhanced emotional regulation remains scarce, even though existing studies suggest that negative emotions can hinder adaptive responses to environmental crises, especially when such emotions disrupt daily functioning. The current study investigated the dynamics of the relationship between dispositional mindfulness, climate change anxiety, and pro-environmental behaviour, in the hypothesis that mindfulness may contribute to predict pro-environmental behaviour by encouraging a more adaptive coping strategy facing the threat of climate change.MethodTwo hundred and sixty-six adults participated in a correlational study and completed self-report measures assessing mindfulness, climate change anxiety, and pro-environmental behaviour, along with several control variables.ResultsThe results of our study revealed that mindfulness skills have a dual effect on the relationship between climate change anxiety and pro-environmental behaviour. At high levels, nonreacting weakened the positive relationship between the cognitive impairment dimension of climate change anxiety and pro-environmental behaviour. Meanwhile, both observing and nonreacting significantly moderated the relationship between the functional impairment dimension of climate change anxiety and pro-environmental behaviour, which became positive in presence of such mindfulness facets.ConclusionsThe outcomes of our investigation offer initial indications of the involvement of dispositional mindfulness in influencing the relationship between climate change anxiety and pro-environmental behaviour. However, this influence manifests in different ways. Whilst mindfulness enhances engagement in pro-environmental behaviour in case of more severe forms of climate change anxiety, it also reduces the motivational drive associated with milder forms of climate change anxiety.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.
Despite self-reported positive explicit attitudes toward mixed-sex couples with Down Syndrome (DS), impacts of socially desirable responding have been a concern for researchers. Thus, the current study investigated variations in implicit and explicit attitudes toward mixed-sex couples with and without DS, impacts of socially desirable responding, and how perceptions of personhood (i.e., the extent to which those with DS are just as ‘human’ as those without). accounted for variations in these attitudes. College students (N =261) were instructed to complete an Implicit Association Test (IAT) and measures of explicit attitudes, socially desirable responding, and personhood perception Results revealed a slight implicit preference toward those without DS over those with DS (DIAT= -0.20), and implicit measures depicted more bias than did explicit measures. Perceptions of personhood were positively correlated with both implicit and explicit attitudes, however, social desirability did not significantly moderate this relationship. Results from this study have important implications for personhood-centered interventions that could potentially reduce stigma and promote increased autonomy for anyone with DS in romantic relationship engagement.
According to Buffer Effect Model, social support is considered a coping strategy in the presence of a stressful situation. This study investigates the link between pregnant women's psychological well-being, cognitive emotion regulation strategies, and partner support, by using buffer effect model. There were 256 Turkish pregnant women in the sample. The Personal Information Form, Partner Support Scale (PSS), Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EDSD), Cognitive Emotion Regulation Scale (CERS), Beck Anxiety Scale (BAI), and Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWBS) used by study participants to collect sociodemographic and pregnancy-related data. Correlation analysis, t-test, anova and bootstrap methods were used. Pregnant women who are at risk of depression, according to the data, score higher on anxiety but lower on psychological well-being and spousal support (p< .05). Women with significant anxiety score higher on depression and have worse psychological well-being and spousal support ratings than women without anxiety (p< .05). Planning refocus and positive reappraisal strategies provide a significant mediating role in the relationship between psychological well-being and marital support. Significant impacts were reported when spousal support became a coping mechanism for pregnant women in several elements of their psychological well-being. The results acquired might aid in the creation of therapeutic and preventative intervention programs in the field of mental health.
Aside from some common movement regularities, significant inter-individual and inter-trial variation within the same individual exists in motor system output. However, there is still a lack of a robust and widely adopted solution for quantifying the degree of similarity between movements. We therefore developed an innovative approach based on the Procrustes transformation to compute 'motor distance' between pairs of kinematic data. As a proof of concept, we tested this on a dataset of reach-to-grasp movements performed by 16 participants while acting with the same confederate. Using the information of wrist velocity, acceleration, and jerk, the proposed technique was able to correctly estimate smaller distances between movements performed by the confederate compared with those of participants. Moreover, the reconstructed pattern of inter-subject distances was consistent when computed either on precision grip prehension or whole hand prehension, suggesting its suitability for the investigation of 'motor styles'. The definition of a solid approach to 'motor distance' computation, therefore, opens the way to new research lines in the field of movement kinematics.

The social contact hypothesis posits that direct contact between different groups can reduce prejudice under specific conditions, and has been foundational in promoting social cohesion and reducing discrimination. Given that people with mental illness often face stigma and discrimination, it is important to evaluate how community volunteering programmes can impact attitudes towards people with mental illness. This study therefore explores how remote interactions between community volunteers and individuals with mental illness impact the volunteers’ perceptions of mental health. Through a qualitative secondary analysis, we examined data from a 12-week remote volunteering support intervention. Interviews with 17 patients and 17 volunteers were conducted in the United Kingdom, where participants were recruited. The analysis revealed three key themes: volunteers’ preconceptions prior to the intervention, volunteers’ challenges when interacting with patients, and volunteers’ improved attitudes towards patients with mental illness post-intervention. Notably, 35% of volunteers reduced their desire to socially distance from individuals with mental illness, while 53% reported no change, and 12% reported an increase. These remote interactions fostered greater understanding and have potential to reduced stigma surrounding mental illness.

Perfectionism is widely associated with social anxiety, yet the relationship is rarely explored with consideration to the multidimensionality of perfectionism. This study investigates the potential mediating effects of the bivalent fear of evaluation (BFOE) model on the relationship between perfectionism dimensions and social anxiety, a construct that proposes the importance of both fear of negative evaluation and fear of positive evaluation in social anxiety. Our research involved 435 university students who completed a large battery of measures as part of a prior study. The results demonstrated that irrespective of valence, fear of evaluation partially mediated a positive relationship between perfectionistic concerns over mistakes and doubts about action and social anxiety, and parental pressures and social anxiety. Additionally, in line with the BFOE model, both valences of fear of evaluation partially mediated a negative indirect effect between perfectionistic order and social anxiety. In contrast, perfectionistic personal standards demonstrated a non-significant bivariate relationship with social anxiety. The study supports the BFOE model and contributes to a deeper understanding of the association between dimensions of perfectionism and social anxiety.
As of 2021, 1.3 billion people globally live with disabilities, with 80% in low-and-middle-income countries and 12.8% in Africa. Women with disabilities often face gender-based discrimination and limited sexual autonomy, impacting their sexual health. Despite global progress, there is limited research on the sexuality of women with disabilities in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Nigeria. This study explores the sexual experiences of women with disabilities in Lagos, Nigeria. Using a qualitative approach, 24 women with disabilities, including blindness and mobility impairments, were interviewed to understand their experiences with sexual activity, autonomy, contraceptive use, risky behaviors, and sexual violence. The participants demographic shows that 67% of participants had physical disabilities, while 33% had visual impairments, with ages ranging from 20 to 45 and varying education and employment levels. Themes were generated around the experience of women with disabilities in sexual activities, modern contraceptive use, sexual autonomy, risky sexual behavior and sexual violence. Many participants did not see their disabilities as hindering sexual activity but faced challenges in relationships due to physical limitations and societal stigma. The study found mixed experiences with modern contraceptives, hindered by misconceptions and accessibility issues, and some women reported experiencing sexual violence and inadequate access to reproductive health resources and support. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, including improved access to contraceptives, public education to reduce stigma, and enhanced legal protections to support the sexual and reproductive health of women with disabilities in Lagos.
To systematically review the existing literature on the efficacy of psychological interventions aimed at improving the sexual health of stroke survivors. A database search was conducted at MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science, EBSCO (APA PsycINFO and APA PsycArticles), and The Cochrane Library. PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. Manuscripts were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I, Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias Tool, and the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies (JBI-CACS). From an initial 1053 publications identified, five studies were included in the present study. The study designs of the selected studies included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, a cross-sectional study, and a case study. The predominant intervention model used in most studies was the PLISSIT model. No studies using a digital-delivered format were identified. This research underscores the potential benefits of tailored interventions for promoting sexual health in stroke survivors and highlights areas for future research.
Investigating internet child exploitation cases poses unique stress for investigators routinely exposed to traumatic material. We posit that this stress arises not only from exposure but also from empathy for victims' suffering, which acts as a predominant job stressor. Drawing from the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, our study examines the relationship between empathy for suffering and burnout, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), among investigators in internet child exploitation cases. We further explore how social support from colleagues moderates these effects. In an online study of 168 investigators (90 women), our findings reveal that empathy for suffering is positively correlated with PTSD and burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion and cynicism), independent of exposure. While prolonged exposure to traumatic content contributes to PTSD, empathy significantly amplifies stress. Social support from colleagues partially moderates the relationship between stressors and adverse health outcomes, serving as a crucial job resource. Our results suggest that, while exposure to disturbing material is a job hazard, empathy for suffering emerges as the predominant stressor. These findings highlight the importance of addressing both exposure and empathy in risk assessment and health promotion strategies for internet child exploitation investigators, with a focus on enhancing social support within the workplace.
Family functioning is used to evaluate the functioning of a family system, which exerts a huge influence on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). However, little is known about how family functioning relates to NSSI among adolescents, and existing research mainly depends on cross-sectional design, which cannot capture dynamic changes between variables. Additionally, NSSI urge has been established as a robust predictor of NSSI engagement and is clinically important. Guided by the integrated model of NSSI, the current study investigated two potential mediators (emotion regulation and self-esteem) of the relations between family functioning and NSSI urges to address these gaps. Participants were 1298 Chinese adolescents (50.5% male;Mage at Wave 2 = 15.08 years) from a three-wave longitudinal study with data spanning ten months. The results supported the chain multiple mediation model. Specifically, valid family functioning prevented NSSI urges through three indirect paths: (a) higher level of self-esteem; (b) more cognitive reappraisal to higher self-esteem; (c) less expressive suppression to higher self-esteem. The prediction of family functioning on cognitive reappraisal was weaker among girls, while the prediction of self-esteem on NSSI urges was stronger. These findings indicate that high family functioning is a powerful protective factor of NSSI urges, and NSSI interventions should aim to improve adolescents’ family functioning, with attention to reinforcing emotion regulation and self-esteem, especially for girls.
PurposeThere is a dearth of information about patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual disability (ID) who seek emergency psychiatric care. Given this backdrop, this retrospective study aims to explore clinical, demographic, and disposition-related information about this patient population over a 10-year period.MethodsThis study includes individuals with ASD or ID (n= 1461) and had presented to a psychiatric emergency department between 2012 and 2021. Data were extracted using a structured chart review methodology, and included demographic, clinical and visit information. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were estimated to explore associations between key variables and dispositions of interest.ResultsSample was predominantly White (77.21%), adolescent (mean age ± SD = 15.5 ± 4.3) and male (72.76%). The most common reason for their presentation was aggression towards others (36.39%). 28.27% of patients were psychiatrically hospitalized but 30% of those who needed hospitalization were discharged due to lack of inpatient bed availability.ConclusionThis study adds to the limited literature about individuals with ASD or ID seeking emergency care. The results indicate a highly acute patient population with aggression, suicidal thoughts, and self-injurious behaviors who are frequently prescribed psychotropic medications and face barriers to accessing higher levels of care.
This methodological paper examines the assessment of interpersonal synchrony during a joint dancing task between mothers and their children (aged 4 to 5 years) using OpenPose. This pose estimation tool captures movement in naturalistic settings. The study analyzes 45 mother–child dyads, comparing two analytical methods for assessing synchrony, and examines their correlation with the Coding Interactive Behavior (CIB) measure of interaction quality. The first method employs cross-wavelet transform (CWT) coherence to assess synchrony based on vertical head movement. This straightforward and computationally efficient approach reveals a significant correlation between interpersonal synchrony and CIB scores, thus implying its potential as a reliable indicator of interaction quality and suggesting its potential as a measure of interaction quality. The second method, the generalized cross-wavelet transform (GCWT), analyzes synchrony across multiple body parts, offering a more complex and detailed analysis of interpersonal dynamics. However, it did not significantly correlate with the CIB scores. Our findings suggest that focusing on head movement using CWT can effectively capture critical elements of interpersonal synchrony linked to interaction quality. In contrast, despite its richness, the more complex GCWT approach may not align as closely with observed interactive behaviors as the CIB scores indicate. This study underscores the need to balance methodological complexity and ecological validity in research, offering insights into selecting analytical techniques based on research objectives and the nuances of interpersonal dynamics. Our results contribute to the field of interpersonal synchrony research, emphasizing the benefits of efficient methods in understanding mother–child interactions and interaction relationships in general.
Recent studies have examined the role and functionality of regulating emotions in academic settings. The main purpose of this study was to explore how various strategies can regulate students’ negative emotions in receiving feedback and challenges in argumentative writing. To formulate this line of research, we employed a multiple case design, using multiple sources of data including a semi-structured interview, narrative inquiry, and diaries to examine how Iranian EFL M.A students regulate their emotions in argumentative writing tasks. The holistic view of findings revealed that students experienced a large range of emotions while receiving feedback and challenges during argumentative writing. As the findings displayed, at the beginning of the course the participants had negative feelings such as shame, disappointment, low self-confidence, and stress which brought about using different strategies to regulate their emotions. These strategies were categorized into three themes: acceptance, cognitive reappraisal, and problem-solving. Besides, not only emotion regulation strategies (ERS) as an internal factor have a great influence on students’ mindsets, but also one external factor known as writing instructor was effective in regulating students’ emotions. The implications and recommendations for ERS are discussed.
This randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of an online autism training intervention in reducing stigma toward autistic individuals. Participants were 208 Korean undergraduate students who were blinded to group allocation, with 106 assigned to the autism training and 102 assigned to a control intervention. All participants completed an online Qualtrics survey that included a pre-test survey (perceived similarity to different minority groups), the training, and a post-test survey (perceived similarity, stigma toward autistic people, knowledge about autism, confidence in their knowledge, and open-responses question asking for descriptions of autism). We conducted independent samplettests and a mixed-effects model to examine group-level differences, and a reliable change index (RCI) analysis to examine individual changes in the perceived similarity score. The responses to the open-ended questions were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results revealed that the experimental group reported reduced stigma toward autistic individuals, increased perceived similarity with autistic individuals, and increased confidence in their autism knowledge and demonstrated increased knowledge about autism compared to the control group. At the individual level, the RCI analysis indicated that the training was effective for a notable subset of participants (25%). At post-test, the experimental group recognized the strengths of autistic people and described autistic individuals as “people like us,” while many in the control group mentioned misconceptions about autism. Future research should employ more robust intervention designs and tailor materials for diverse target populations, including administrators, to foster systemic destigmatization.
This study examined the psychometric properties of self-rated symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD). We analyzed symptom ratings from a clinical outpatient sample of 658 adolescents aged 11;0–17;11 years diagnosed with ODD/CD and/or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. In two steps, we examined the factor structure of ODD models and an additional CD symptom dimension using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM). Our preferred three-factor CFA and ESEM models (CFI = 0.937–0.975, TLI = 0.926–0.962, RMSEA = 0.049–0.068, SRMR = 0.045–0.070) demonstrated scalar measurement invariance across age groups (≥ 14;0 years) and metric measurement invariance across informants (parents, teachers). With exceptions, the self-rated symptom scales showed acceptable internal consistencies (α = 0.68–0.84). Convergent (r=.27–.65) and divergent validity (r=.13–.41) were supported using Achenbach’s Youth Self Report Form. Our results provide implications for using self-rated ODD/CD symptoms in clinical practice and research.
Anxiety sensitivity may be associated with both anxiety and eating disorder symptoms, which could contribute to the frequent comorbidity of both syndromes. This study examined the common (i.e., correlated) genetic and environmental contributions to anxiety sensitivity, cognitive symptoms of eating disorder severity, and anxiety symptoms to understand their co-occurrence in adolescence. This study analyzed data from the Twins Early Development Study. When twins were 16 years old (N = 5,111 pairs), they self-reported anxiety sensitivity via the Child Anxiety Sensitivity Index and cognitive symptoms of eating disorder severity via four items from the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale. Parents reported adolescent anxiety symptoms via the Anxiety Related Behaviour Questionnaire. Common genetic and non-shared environmental factors contributed to phenotypic correlations among cognitive symptoms of eating disorders. Genetic and nonshared environmental influences contributed to anxiety sensitivity and a latent variable of cognitive symptoms of eating disorder severity. Genetic, shared-, and nonshared- environmental influences contributed to anxiety symptoms. Common genetic and nonshared environmental influences contributed to anxiety sensitivity and anxiety symptoms, as well as anxiety sensitivity and cognitive symptoms of eating disorder severity. However, there was no evidence of common genetic or environmental contributions to anxiety symptoms and cognitive symptoms of eating disorder severity. This study implicates anxiety sensitivity as a potential cognitive process associated with both anxiety symptoms and cognitive symptoms of eating disorders.
Research suggests that majority racial group members in the USA (i.e., White people) sometimes respond to high levels of racial out-group representation with attitudinal concerns about anti-White discrimination, particularly among those who endorse more conservative (vs. more liberal) ideology and perceive economic threats to their in-group. However, research has not yet assessed whether these variables predict actual anti-White discrimination claiming behavior at work. These claims are potentially problematic because concerns about White racial victimization are often cited as a reason to scale back policies aimed at improving racial diversity and racial justice in organizations. We investigate the effects of racial out-group representation, political ideology, and in-group economic threat on the prevalence of anti-White discrimination claims in US counties. In doing so, we contribute to scholarship examining the relationship between workplace intergroup relations and the social contexts surrounding them. We use computational methods to combine (a) a geocoded dataset of discrimination claims filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with (b) county-level data on the representation of people of color, (c) White unemployment rates, and (d) political liberalism-conservatism. Results reveal a positive relationship between the proportional representation of people of color and the proportion of claims filed for anti-White discrimination and further show that this positive association is stronger in counties with higher conservatism (vs. liberalism). This study provides the first large-scale support for the hypothesis that racial out-group representation positively relates to majority group members’ claims of racial victimization, particularly amid strong preferences to conserve the status quo.
Emotional working memory (WM) involves retaining and processing emotionally charged information, integrating emotions into cognitive tasks like decision-making and attention management. While anxiety affects dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity, research on how different anxiety levels impact WM remains inconclusive. To investigate this, participants were divided into Mild and Moderate anxiety groups based on their Beck Anxiety Inventory scores. Their performance on 2-back emotional WM task was compared both behaviorally and neurologically. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure oxyhemoglobin levels in the dlPFC. The results showed that both groups had similar performance, with no significant differences in correct responses to the spatial location of emotional face stimuli. This suggests that emotional stimuli do not affect WM performance between groups. However, imaging data revealed hemisphere-specific differences in oxyhemoglobin changes, with no significant difference between hemispheres. The Moderate anxiety group exhibited reduced oxyhemoglobin levels in the right dlPFC compared to Mild anxiety group, while no significant difference was observed in the left dlPFC. These findings indicate that the degree of anxiety in healthy individuals affects WM processes in the right dlPFC, although this differs slightly from findings comparing high and low anxiety scores in healthy or diagnosed anxiety participants. Notably, these differences did not impair WM performance when participants provided non-verbal responses. This suggests that moderate anxiety may alter the neural mechanisms underlying WM without affecting the output of non-verbal tasks. Further research is needed to understand how WM, with or without emotional components, varies between individuals with mild and moderate anxiety levels.
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the widespread adoption of telehealth services, yet challenges persist in providing them to socially vulnerable communities. A comprehensive understanding of the implementation challenges of digital mental health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is lacking, particularly in Brazil, where high rates of mental health impact and significant socioeconomic disparities are prevalent. Mental health platforms were developed during the pandemic, emphasising partnerships to deliver telehealth for vulnerable populations. These platforms included an online self-knowledge journey offering personalised feedback through videos, audios, and texts. Telephone interviews with 357 residents from these communities were conducted to gain insights into their interests regarding digital services. While most participants (61.9%) acknowledged the usefulness of digital mental health services, only a few (n= 15) had utilised them before, underscoring the untapped potential of telehealth for vulnerable communities. Participants showed a keen interest in apps and videos, data that must be considered when implementing telehealth services for this population. Younger participants (18–39 years old) showed a greater inclination towards digital mental health services (p< 0.001), while older adults (60 +) tended to prefer face-to-face interventions. Recommendations include tailoring digital mental health solutions for younger demographics and addressing health access disparities (e.g., through digital health literacy and hybrid approaches) among various population subgroups to facilitate effective telehealth implementation. Different profiles have varying needs that should be considered when implementing digital services. Overcoming the barriers to the adoption of telehealth is imperative for successfully executing these initiatives, especially in LMICs.
Despite extensive research on the impact of individual and environmental factors on negative risk-taking behaviors, the understanding of these factors’ influence on positive risk-taking, and how it compares to negative risk taking, remains limited. This research employed machine-learning techniques to identify shared and unique predictors across individual, family, and peer domains. Participants (N= 1012; 44% girls;Mage = 14.60 years, SD = 1.16 years) were drawn from three public middle schools in a large city in southern China (with 49.2% in grade 7 and 50.8% in grade 11). The findings indicate that positive risk-taking is significantly associated with general risk propensity, self-control, and negative parenting by father, while negative risk-taking is correlated with self-control, deviant peer affiliations, and peer victimization. Paternal negative parenting triggered positive risk-taking in boys, whereas self-control had a greater impact on girls. For negative risk-taking, boys were more affected by peer victimization, while girls were more influenced by deviant peer affiliations. This study further demonstrates that as progress from junior to senior high school, peer influence grows more significant in predicting positive risk taking; deviant peer affiliations exert a persistent pivotal influence, future positive time perspective replaces life satisfaction, and paternal negative parenting becomes increasingly impactful in predicting negative risk taking.
Children with special educational needs (SEN) experience developmental trajectories that require close attention, especially as they are highly vulnerable to sexual violence. Ensuring their well-being requires systemic attention to their needs. However, literature on children with SEN has critical limitations including insufficient focus on their sexual health education (SHE), inattention to parents’ perspectives, and a dearth of multilevel approaches to understanding SHE, particularly in conservative contexts like Malaysia. Using Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory, this study explored parents’ perspectives on SHE for their children with SEN across different layers of the socio-ecological environment. We interviewed 14 Malaysian parents of school-going children with SEN aged 4 to 24 years and conducted thematic analysis. At the individual level (child characteristics), we found that children with SEN receive unstructured and inconsistent SHE and are perceived as unready for SHE. At the microsystem level (family and school), parents displayed a belief-action gap towards SHE, and feared for their children’s sexual safety. The mesosystem (interactions between microsystems) highlighted the lack of teacher-parent collaboration in SHE delivery. Within the exosystem (external policies), parents noted a deficiency in stringent policies, leading parents to rely on unverified resources for SHE delivery. Finally, at the macrosystem level (cultural and societal influences), Malaysia’s diverse religious and cultural beliefs shape SHE implementation. This study emphasizes the importance of socio-cultural factors in SHE for children with SEN and stresses prioritizing their needs in policymaking and practice. It also calls for developing parent-centered programs and culturally tailored resources to improve parental awareness and knowledge.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with altered brain activity. However, little is known about the integrated temporospatial variation of dynamic spontaneous brain activity in ASD. In the present study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed for 105 ASD and 102 demographically-matched typically developmental controls (TC) children obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange database. Using the sliding-window approach, temporal, spatial, and temporospatial variability of dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (tvALFF, svALFF, and tsvALFF) were calculated for each participant. Group-comparisons were further performed at global, network, and brain region levels to quantify differences between ASD and TC groups. The relationship between temporospatial dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation variation alterations and clinical symptoms of ASD was finally explored by a support vector regression model. Relative to TC, we found enhanced tvALFF in visual network (Vis), somatomotor network (SMT), and salience/ventral attention network (SVA) of ASD, and weakened tvALFF in dorsal attention network (DAN) of ASD. Besides, ASD showed decreased svALFF in Vis, SVA, and limbic network (Limbic), and increased svALFF in DAN and default mode network (DMN). Elevated tsvALFF was found in the Vis, SMT, and DMN of ASD. More importantly, the altered tsvALFF from the DMN can predict the symptom severity of ASD. These findings demonstrate altered temporospatial dynamics of the spontaneous brain activity in ASD and provide novel insights into the neural mechanism underlying ASD.
The present study introduces the Persian Sentence Reading (PSR) Corpus, aiming to expand empirical data for Persian, an under-investigated language in research on oculomotor control in reading. Reading research has largely focused on Latin script languages with a left-to-right reading direction. However, languages with different reading directions, such as right-to-left and top-to-bottom, and particularly Persian script-based languages like Farsi and Dari, have remained understudied. This study pioneers in providing an eye movement dataset for reading Persian sentences, enabling further exploration of the influences of unique Persian characteristics on eye movement patterns during sentence reading. The core objective of the study is to provide data about how word characteristics impact eye movement patterns. The research also investigates the characteristics of the interplay between neighboring words and eye movements on them. By broadening the scope of reading research beyond commonly studied languages, the study aims to contribute to an interdisciplinary approach to reading research, exemplifying investigations through various theoretical and methodological perspectives.
To examine the relationship between empathy and mental health in healthcare workers, the mediating role of social support, and the moderating role of academic qualifications. A sample of 513 healthcare workers completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Social Support Scale, and General Health Questionnaire. (1) Significant correlations were observed among empathy (cognitive empathy), social support (including intra-family support, friend support, and significant other support), and mental health (P< 0.01). (2) Social support was found to be a significant mediator in the relationship linking empathy to the mental health of healthcare workers (P< 0.001). (3) Educational qualifications were identified as a moderating factor in the relationship linking social support to mental health (P<0.01). Specifically, social support exhibited a stronger association with mental health among healthcare workers with lower educational levels (β= -0.516,t= -9.414,P< 0.001). Healthcare workers’ psychological well-being can be enhanced by nurturing their empathy and establishing a robust social support system.
This paper explores the evolving relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and human creativity through two distinct yet interconnected perspectives: contemporary insights on AI's cognitive capabilities and philosophical foundations of creativity. In the first part, it examines the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in replicating human thought and creativity, emphasizing the importance of embodied cognition, emotional depth, and ethical considerations surrounding AI-generated content. Key findings from neuroscience and studies on algorithm aversion highlight the necessity of maintaining human authenticity in creative practices. The second part draws on influential thinkers such as Rollo May, Judith Butler, Kimberlé Crenshaw, and bell hooks to underscore the deeply personal and relational dimensions of creativity that AI cannot replicate. It discusses concepts such as courage, performativity, intersectionality, and emotional intelligence, illuminating the complexities of human identity and expression. The paper concludes with recommendations aimed at fostering collaboration between AI and human creators, developing ethical guidelines, and enhancing critical literacy regarding AI technologies. By synthesizing these perspectives, the paper underscores the need to recognize and preserve the unique qualities of human creativity in an increasingly AI-influenced landscape, inviting thoughtful engagement with the intersection of human expression and technological innovation.
Past research suggests that pitch height can influence the perceived tempo of speech and music, such that higher-pitched signals seem faster than lower-pitched ones. However, previous studies have analyzed perceived tempo across a relatively limited range of fundamental frequencies. To investigate whether this higher-equals-faster illusion generalizes across the wider range of human hearing, we conducted a series of five experiments. We asked participants to compare the tempo of repeating tones from six different octaves and with 15 different interonset intervals to a metronomic standard tempo. In Experiments1–3, we observed an inverted U-shaped effect of pitch on perceived tempo, with the perceived tempo of piano tones peaking between A4 (440 Hz) and A5 (880 Hz) and decreasing at lower and higher frequencies. This bias was consistent across base tempos and was only slightly attenuated by synchronous tapping with the repeating tones. Experiment4tested synthetic complex tones to verify that this nonlinearity generalizes beyond the piano timbre and that it was not related to the presence of low-frequency mechanical noise present in our piano tones. Experiment5revealed that the decrease in perceived tempo at extremely high octaves can be abolished by exposing participants to only high-pitched tones. Together, our results suggest that perceived tempo depends more on the relative pitch within a context than on absolute pitch and that tempo biases may invert or taper off beyond a two-octave range. We relate this context-dependence to human vocal ranges and propose that illusory tempo effects are strongest within pitch ranges consistent with human vocalization.
Pupillometry is a popular method because pupil size is easily measured and sensitive to central neural activity linked to behavior, cognition, emotion, and perception. Currently, there is no method for online monitoring phases of pupil size fluctuation. We introducertPupilPhase—an open-source software that automatically detects trends in pupil size in real time. This tool enables novel applications of real-time pupillometry for achieving numerous research and translational goals. We validated the performance of rtPupilPhase on human, rodent, and monkey pupil data, and we propose future implementations of real-time pupillometry.
Gender inequality is prevalent in patriarchal societies, influencing the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Despite their significant contributions, research focusing on women-related topics in behavior analysis has only recently garnered consistent attention in Brazil. This oversight suggests a historical silencing and invisibility of women and their interests in this domain. The current research conducted a bibliometric analysis of authorship distribution between men and women in scientific publications within Brazilian Behavior Analysis journals from 2010 to 2022. The findings reveal a consistent female presence in scholarly output, with the percentage of publications featuring female authors ranging from 63.7% to 88.8%, consistently remaining above 70% in the past five years analyzed. However, gender inequality was observed concerning women as leading authors, ranging from 38.46% to 75.3%. The study recommends potential research methodologies and approaches to identify gender inequalities in science. It also provides actionable suggestions for interventions to address the underrepresentation of women in Behavior Analysis.
A positive caregiver-teacher relationship has the potential to promote student progress. Yet, little is understood about factors contributing to effective caregiver-teacher alliance and team building on behalf of students with autism. Data from randomized controlled trials of a home-school collaborative planning and teacher coaching intervention called COMPASS were used to determine whether caregivers’ perceptions of teacher alliance was associated with child goal attainment outcomes, and what caregiver and child factors were associated with alliance of the 75 caregivers, those who received COMPASS were more likely to report higher alliance compared to caregivers who did not receive COMPASS. Further, higher ratings of objective assessment of child goal attainment of social, communication, and learning skills were associated with higher alliance. For child variables, higher caregiver and teacher ratings of externalizing behavior were associated with lower ratings of alliance. Lastly, higher ratings of caregiving stress were associated with lower alliance. Autism severity, age, adaptive behavior, IQ and family income were not associated with alliance; however, caregiver stress was significantly associated. These findings demonstrate the association between alliance and child progress and how COMPASS improves alliance. Also, attention to caregivers of children with externalizing behaviors may be particularly warranted given the impact on caregiver-teacher alliance.
This paper introduces a new database of eye-tracking data on English derived words, DerLex. A total of 598 unique derived suffixed words were embedded in sentences and read by 357 participants representing both university convenience pools and community pools of non-college-bound adults. Besides the eye-movement record of reading derived suffixed words, the DerLex database provides the author recognition test (ART) scores for each participant, tapping into their reading proficiency, as well as multiple lexical variables reflecting distributional, orthographic, phonological, and semantic features of the words, their constituent morphemes, and morphological families. The paper additionally reports the main effects of select lexical variables and their interactions with the ART scores. It also produces estimates of statistical power and sample sizes required to reliably detect those lexical effects. While some effects are robust and can be readily detected even in a small-scale typical experiment, the over-powered DerLex database does not offer sufficient power to detect many other effects—including those of theoretical importance for existing accounts of morphological processing. We believe that both the availability of the new data resource and the limitations it provides for the planning and design of upcoming experiments are useful for future research on morphological complexity.
Most current databases for bodily emotion expression are created in Western countries, resulting in culturally skewed representations. To address the obvious risk this bias poses to academic comprehension, we attempted to expand the current repertoire of human bodily emotions by recruiting Asian professional performers to wear whole-body suits with 57 retroreflective markers attached to major joints and body segments, and express seven basic emotions with whole-body movements in a motion-capture lab. For each emotion, actors performed three self-created scenarios that covered a broad range of real-life events to elicit the target emotion within 2–5 seconds. Subsequently, a separate group of participants was invited to judge the perceived emotional category from the extracted biological motions (point-light displays with 18 or 57 markers). The results demonstrated that the emotion discrimination accuracy was comparable to Western databases containing standardized performance scenarios. The results provide a significant step toward establishing a database using a novel emotional induction approach based on personalized scenarios. This database will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of emotional expression across diverse contexts.
Hope is a cognitive trait defined as the perceived capacity to identify strategies (pathways) and maintain motivation (agency) in the pursuit of goals. Hope is most commonly measured using the Adult Hope Scale (AHS). Past work has provided support for the factor structure and reliability of the AHS, but there is limited evidence of measurement invariance of the AHS. The present study examined measurement invariance across race/ethnicity and gender in a large and diverse (n= 3495; 76.9% Women, 32.9% Hispanic, 32.3% Asian/Pacific Islander, 22.1% White, and 12.7% Black/African American) sample of young adults in the United States. Results supported scalar measurement invariance across all race/ethnicity and gender groups and minimal differences in associations between the agency and pathways components of hope or mean levels of hope across groups with the exception of Asian adults reporting lower levels of hope than other groups. These results provide clear empirical support for the consistency of the factor structure and assessment of hope across race/ethnicity and gender and provide an important foundation for examining the potential benefits of hope across diverse populations.
The university years are when individuals evaluate their qualifications, make choices about their careers, and develop the adaptation process and skills they may need for the careers that they may choose. In this context, individuals’ competencies and abilities in various fields play an essential role. Four hundred nine university students (304 female, 105 male) participated in this study. This research explains the theoretical model that the variables of general self-efficacy, and career adaptability affect the hope through structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings of general self-efficacy and career adaptability explain hope by 85%. In addition, career adaptability has a mediating role in the relationship between general self-efficacy and hope. These results are thought to be essential for the guidance services to be implemented at the university level.
The objectives of the current study were to investigate the potential mediating role of alcohol consumption motives in the relationships between psychological distress and problematic alcohol consumption, and emotional dysregulation and problematic alcohol consumption. This study included 292 participants from Romania, with 82.5% female, ranging in age from 19 to 62 years (M = 28.71; SD = 9.34). The participants completed instruments assessing psychological distress, emotional dysregulation, drinking motives, problematic alcohol consumption, and socio-demographic data. Our findings indicate that psychological distress and emotional dysregulation predict problematic alcohol consumption. Additionally, social, conformity, and coping motives mediated the relationships between psychological distress and problematic alcohol consumption, as well as between emotional dysregulation and problematic alcohol consumption. Meanwhile, the enhancement motive did not mediate the aforementioned relationships. This may be attributed to its association with seeking positive experiences rather than managing negative emotions, making it less relevant for individuals experiencing psychological distress in the Romanian cultural context, where alcohol is often used for social engagement or conformity rather than enhancement. Our study contributes to advancing the knowledge from the literature regarding how people engage in problematic alcohol consumption, while highlighting the importance of consumption motives. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
We tested whether targets receiving high (vs. low) social support would be expected to experience less emotional and physical pain because higher social support is expected to work as a buffer against pain. Participants (n= 330) were assigned to one of six conditions (social support: high vs. low vs. control × target gender: male vs. female). Participants estimated the emotional (but not physical) pain of targets receiving high social support to be lower than that of those receiving low social support. A test of a serial mediation model (i.e., social support → target impression → expected buffering effect → pain estimation) revealed that participants rated high social support targets’ impression more positively, which predicted expectation of a larger emotional/physical buffering effect, which in turn was associated with estimation of lower emotional/physical pain.
Numerous studies have highlighted the links between involvement in extracurricular activities and positive outcomes for youth. Nevertheless, studies documenting those links have been conducted primarily in the global North. Little is known about the effect of participating in extracurricular activities for youth developing in extreme contexts (i.e. extreme poverty, refugee camps, conflicted areas, areas affected by climate changes, sexual exploitation or child soldiers). This research is testing if the participation in extracurricular activities of youth (N = 96; Mage= 15.07) developing in an extreme context had an effect over time on their psychological well-being as well as the satisfaction and frustration of their basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence and relatedness). Youth were recruited through a partnership with a local NGO in southern Madagascar, which offers art and sports activities. A control group was recruited in a neighboring public school. Participants had never participated in NGO’s extracurricular activities before entering the study. Four data collection sessions were carried out over a span of 16 months. 96 participants engaged throughout the four data collection sessions. Mixed factorial Analyses of Variance were employed to test the objective. Results show that participation in extracurricular activities for youth developing in an extreme context had positive effects on the satisfaction of the need for autonomy (p = .037) and on the frustration of the basic psychological needs overall (p = .019). Also, the study results show that there was a protective effect of participating in extracurricular activities against the decrease of the needs’ satisfaction as this reduction was observed in the control group (p = .038) and not in the youth involved in extracurricular activities. Participation in art, music and sport extracurricular activities seems to have positive outcomes for youth living in an extreme context of development.
The author discusses the idea that psychoanalysts could benefit from a common paradigm, not necessarily a single theory, but a general frame through which to view their work. Focusing on perception as a basic modality of psychic life, in combination with the system-environment approach, could provide this common baseline. The text explores how this approach relates to the work of Freud, Bion, and Winnicott, emphasizing the interconnectedness of systems and their environments, the role of perception, and the concept of a contact barrier. The notion of tangential interlocking is proposed as a way of illustrating how the system Freud called perception-consciousness is the contact-barrier common to all the psycho-somatic functions of interest to psychoanalysis.
Motivational drivers and emotions that students experience play an important role in the process of learning a new language (L2). This has been recognised by researchers and educators, and extensive research has been conducted in recent decades to examine the psychological and emotional factors involved in L2 learning. However, two ubiquitous epistemic emotions, namely, boredom and curiosity, remain underexplored in the L2 research literature. This study addresses this gap. It performed a series of statistical tests to examine the relationship between these two epistemic emotions and L2 motivation. Specifically, it assessed whether epistemic curiosity plays a mediating role in the nexus of L2 motivation, epistemic curiosity, and epistemic boredom. Data were collected from adolescent learners of English in China (N= 312). The findings from the correlation analysis indicated that epistemic boredom had statistically significant negative relationships with epistemic curiosity and L2 motivation, except for the ought-to L2 self variable, where the relationship was not statistically significant. Conversely, epistemic curiosity had a positive and statistically significant relationship with L2 motivation, except for the ought-to L2 self variable, where the relationship was not statistically significant. Next, the path analysis examined the influence of L2 motivation on epistemic boredom without considering the mediating effect of epistemic curiosity. Its findings indicated that epistemic boredom had a statistically significant negative relationship with the general motivation/attitude and general motivation/effort variables. The subsequent path analysis, which focused solely on two goal-oriented L2 motivation constructs from the Gardnerian framework, detected the mediating role of epistemic curiosity. Some pedagogical implications are drawn from these findings.
Bystander intervention programs have the potential to address domestic violence in college settings by providing students with specific ways to support friends and peers experiencing abuse. However, the majority of bystander intervention programs require in-person facilitators and hours of commitment. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a self-paced online program focusing on bystander intervention for domestic violence. TheStop the Silence Projectis a self-paced online program that can be utilized at no cost and in the absence of trained facilitators or scheduled training sessions. An experimental group of college students (n= 168) engaged with the program and completed theBystander Intervention for Domestic Violence Questionnaire. A control group (n= 30) completed the questionnaire without engaging with the program. First, an exploratory factor analysis was performed to validate theBystander Intervention for Domestic Violence Questionnaire. Results indicated that the questionnaire measures students’ willingness to offer support to peers, intentions to address domestic violence as a societal issue, and sense of responsibility to help one’s peers. Next, the two groups were compared on their responses to the questionnaire. College students who engaged with the program reported higher intentions to address domestic violence as a societal issue. This promising program offers one way to counter domestic violence when faced with limited resources in college and university settings.
A growing body of literature supports the use of echoic prompts toward conditioning other functional language skills. However, many individuals with autism spectrum disorder do not emit echoic behavior. Identifying the prerequisite skills of an echoic repertoire may be beneficial for intervention planning and clinical decision making. A chart review was conducted for 118 patients with autism who received early intensive behavioral intervention. We examined the Level 1 scores on theVerbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program(Sundberg,2014) for all patients. Using their scores on the echoic skills subtest as a dependent variable, we ran a binomial logistic regression in which the remaining eight domains, along with age and sex, served as independent variables. Our logistic regression model was statistically significant:X2(10) = 109.61,p< .001. The model explained 86.0% of the variance in echoic verbal behavior and correctly classified 95.8% of cases. Patients who demonstrated a mand repertoire were greater than 3.5 times more likely to also exhibit an echoic repertoire. Additionally, vocal play and motor imitation were associated with an increased ability to echo. Using binomial logistic regression, we identified three predictors influencing the echoic behavior of children with autism. Patients who demonstrated these three skills were statistically significantly more likely to echo the vocal verbal behavior of others. Additional research is now needed to confirm a functional relationship between each of these predictors and echoic control.
Mathematical and spatial abilities are positively related at both the behavioral and neural levels. Much of the evidence illuminating this relationship comes from classic laboratory-based experimental methods focused on cognitive performance despite most individuals also experiencing math and space in other contexts, such as in conversations or lectures. To broaden our understanding of math-space integration in these more commonplace situations, we used an auditory memory-encoding task with stimuli whose content evoked a range of educational and everyday settings related to math or spatial thinking. We used a multivariate approach to directly assess the extent of neural similarity between activity patterns elicited by these math and spatial stimuli. Results from whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed a highly specific positive relation between math and spatial activity patterns in bilateral anterior hippocampi. Examining individual variation in math-space similarity, we found that greater math-space similarity in bilateral anterior hippocampi was associated withpoorermath skills andhigheranxiety about math. Integration of neural responses to mathematical and spatial content may not always portend positive outcomes. We suggest that episodic simulation of quotidian contexts may link everyday experiences with math and spatial thinking—and the strength of this link is predictive of math in a manner that diverges from math-space associations derived from more lab-based tasks. On a methodological level, this work points to the value of considering a wider range of experimental paradigms, and of the value of combining multivariate fMRI analysis with behavioral data to better contextualize interpretations of brain data.
Students with high incidence disabilities in the public school system often perform multiple grade levels below their typically developing peers in mathematics achievement. These students exhibit lower levels of on-task behavior that limits their access to effective instruction, thus requiring instructional interventions that personalize learning, differentiate materials, and ultimately promote academic engagement. In recent years, the use of technology-mediated and computer-assisted instruction has shown to have positive results with students with disabilities. Blended learning, an intervention that combines face-to-face instruction with computer-based instruction, has been shown to improve the on-task behavior and achievement of students with disabilities. In this study, blended learning was implemented with three middle school students with emotional behavior disorders in a therapeutic setting in a large city in the southeastern United States. Using a multiple baseline across participants single case design, this study examined the relationship between blended learning eighth grade mathematics instruction and student on-task behavior, teacher engagement, and mathematics achievement. After exposure to the intervention through 21 sessions over 5 weeks, both student and teacher engagement increased with the use of station-rotation blended learning. Math achievement, measured through the AIMSweb curriculum-based math probes, improved for two of three student participants. Social validity questionnaires revealed that students and teacher enjoyed the blended learning intervention; however, continued use depended on properly functioning technology. Future research in the area of blended learning math instruction should strive to accurately measure on- and off-task behavior under the computer-based condition.
The nature of visual processes underlying scene perception remains a hotly debated topic. According to one view, scene and object perception rely on similar neural mechanisms, and their processing pathways are tightly interlinked. According to another, scene gist might follow a separate pathway, relying primarily on global image properties. Recently, this latter idea has been supported with a set of experiments using content priming as a probe into scene and object perception (Brady et al.Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance,43, 1160–1176,2017). The experiments have shown that preserving only structureless global ensemble texture information in the images of scenes could support rapid scene perception; however, preserving the same information in the images of objects failed to support object perception. We were intrigued by these results, since they are at odds with findings showing that scene content is primarily carried by the explicit encoding of scene structure as represented, for instance, by contours and their properties. In an attempt to reconcile these results, we attempted to replicate the experiments. In our replication experiment, we failed to find any evidence for a privileged use of texture information for scene as opposed to object primes. We conclude that there is no sufficient evidence for any fundamental differences in the processing pathways for object and scene perception: both rely on structural features that describe spatial relationships between constituent parts as well as texture information. To address this issue in the most rigorous manner possible, we here present the results of both a pilot experiment and a pre-registered replication attempt.
Quigley and colleagues described a treatment recommendation scenario within a multi-disciplinary team setting for an adult with a developmental disability. The authors presented the information in a standard format to share how the involved parties identified, evaluated, and responded to the recommendation based upon their understanding of ethical decision-making. In this response, the right to effective treatment is emphasized as a primary obligation of the treatment team. The review of the procedure reveals that the intended intervention is one that is both unproven to be effective and similar to an intervention known to be harmful. Multiple available resources support the need to avoid the use of this intervention. Implications and suggestions for decision-making in clinical contexts are highlighted.
The main goal of the present research was to explore the links between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism and fertility (number of children) due to its conceptual significance in estimating the adaptiveness of narcissism in an evolutionary sense. Furthermore, we aimed to explain these links via mating behavior (attachment in romantic relationships, short and long-term mating, and relationship satisfaction) and reproductive motivation (positive and negative childbearing motivations, and age of first reproduction) in participants from Serbia (N= 953). Correlation analysis showed similar associations between the two narcissism dimensions, mating and reproduction: negative associations are found between narcissism components and fertility, and long-term mating, followed by positive correlations with insecure attachment and negative childbearing motivations (although grandiose narcissism had positive associations with positive childbearing motives as well). Therefore, correlation analysis together with the structural model where narcissism is analyzed as a single trait showed that narcissism as a whole is associated with lower fitness. However, a structural model where two subdimensions are modeled separately revealed substantial differences between the two forms of narcissism in regard to mating and reproduction. The link between vulnerable narcissism and fertility was completely mediated by lower reproductive motivation (both types of motives), shorter duration of romantic relationships, and diminished relationship satisfaction. On the other hand, grandiose narcissism was positively associated with positive childbearing motives and relationship satisfaction; hence, it was positively indirectly associated with fertility via these links. The present findings may shed some light on differences between the narcissistic traits in their links with fertility—while both narcissistic dimensions seem to be largely maladaptive in an evolutionary sense, the distinctive features of grandiose narcissism may have some benefits for fertility.
Social anxiety (SA) and depressive disorder usually coexist. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a protective factor against emotional disorders. The aim of this study is to examine the moderating role of EI in the relationship between SA and depression among Spanish and Portuguese adolescents. Information on these variables was collected through a cross-sectional study with 1456 students between 12 and 19 years of age. The software PROCESS was used to perform the analysis of conditional processes (model 1). The moderation model was conducted, including the covariate country, and showed significant differences between countries in the relationship between SA and Depression. The summary model explained that 42% of the Depression. The statistical analysis was repeated separately for Portuguese and Spanish adolescents, with EI as the moderating variable. The effect of SA on depression was significant for individuals with low or moderate EI, while for adolescents with high EI there was no statistically significant effect. To prevent these outcomes, early interventions, including the enhancement of Trait EI, with adolescents with SA could reduce the risk of developing SA disorder, as well as subsequent depressive disorders in adolescence and early adulthood. This is especially important because research indicates that depression caused by SA is strongly associated with a worse course of depression.
Imageability, an important word characteristic in the psycholinguistic literature, is typically assessed by asking participants to estimate the ease with which a word can evoke a mental image. Our aim was to explore inter-rater disagreement in normative imageability ratings. We examined the predictors of variability around average imageability ratings for young, middle-aged and older adults (Study1) and assessed its impact on visual word recognition performance in young adults (Study2). Analyses of French age-related imageability ratings (Ballot et al.,Behavior Research Methods,54, 196–215,2022) revealed that inter-rater disagreement around the average imageability value was critically high for most words within the imageability norms, thus questioning the construct validity of the average rating for the most variable items. Variability in ratings changed between age groups (18-25, 26-40, 41-59, and over 60 years) and was associated with words that are longer, less frequent, learnt later in life and less emotional (Study1). To examine the consequences of elevated standard deviations around the average imageability rating on visual word recognition, we entered this factor in a hierarchical regression alongside classic lexico-semantic predictors. The effect of word-imageability on young adults’ lexical decision times (Ferrand et al.,Behavior Research Methods,50, 1285–1307,2018) remained significant after accounting for inter-rater disagreement in imageability ratings, even when considering the least consensual words (Study2). We conclude that imageability ratings reliably predict visual word recognition performance in young adults for large datasets, but might require caution for smaller ones. Given imageability rating differences across adulthood, further research investigating age-related differences in language processing is necessary.
Statistical learning is a mechanism for detecting associations among co-occurring elements in many domains and species. A key controversy is whether it leads to memory for discrete chunks composed of these associated elements, or merely to pairwise associations among elements. Critical evidence for the mere-association view comes from the “phantom-word” phenomenon, where learners recognize statistically coherent but unattested items better than actually presented items with weaker internal associations, suggesting that they prioritize pairwise associations over memories for discrete units. However, this phenomenon has only been demonstrated for sequentially presented stimuli, but not for simultaneously presented visual shapes, where learners might prioritize discrete units over pairwise associations. Here, I ask whether the phantom-word phenomenon can be observed with simultaneously presented visual shapes. Learners were familiarized with scenes combining two triplets of visual shapes (hereafter “words”). They were then tested on their recognition of these words vs. part-words (attested items with weaker internal associations), of phantom-words (unattested items with strong internal associations) vs. part-words, and of words vs. phantom-words. Learners preferred both words and phantom-words over part-words and showed no preference for words over phantom-words. This suggests that, as for sequentially input, statistical learning in simultaneously presented shapes leads primarily to pairwise associations rather than to memories for discrete chunks. However, as, in some analyses, the preference for words over part-words was slightly higher than for phantom-words over part-words, the results do not rule out that, for simultaneous presented items, learners might have some limited sensitivity to frequency of occurrence.
Process-based behavior therapy (PBBT®) is a recently developed therapeutic approach based almost entirely on the core behavioral process of arbitrarily applicable relational responding (AARR), as postulated by relational frame theory (RFT), and in particular on advances in the theory made in recent years. In particular, PBBT directs its attention towards the hyper-dimensional multi-level (HDML) framework for conceptualizing relational responding and the basic behavioral unit that emerged from that framework, called the ROE unit (i.e., the ongoing dynamic interaction of Relating, Orienting, and Evoking), for conceptualizing human psychological events. The current article seeks to outline and provide an introduction to PBBT as a contemporary behavioral therapeutic approach to psychological suffering and mental well-being. Toward this aim, the ROE unit and related RFT concepts will first be summarized followed by presentation of three key components of PBBT. Clinical examples are provided throughout to help illustrate the tight links between updated RFT and its clinical application in PBBT.
Determining an appropriate sample size in psychological experiments is a common challenge, requiring a balance between maximizing the chance of detecting a true effect (minimizing false negatives) and minimizing the risk of observing an effect where none exists (minimizing false positives). A recent study proposes using effect size stabilization, a form of optional stopping, to define sample size without increasing the risk of false positives. In effect size stabilization, researchers monitor the effect size of their samples throughout the sampling process and stop sampling when the effect no longer varies beyond predefined thresholds. This study aims to improve our understanding of effect size stabilization properties. Simulations involving effect size stabilization are presented, with parametric modulation of the true effect in the population and the strictness of the stabilization rule. As previously demonstrated, the results indicate that optional stopping based on effect-size stabilization consistently yields unbiased samples over the long run. However, simulations also reveal that effect size stabilization does not guarantee the detection of a true effect in the population. Consequently, researchers adopting effect size stabilization put themselves at risk of increasing type 2 error probability. Instead of using effect-size stabilization procedures for testing, researchers should use them to reach accurate parameter estimates.
The purpose of this design case is to narrate an iterative design story to develop a series of technology preparation curricula for teacher preparation contextualized in a Hispanic Serving Institution in the Southwest United States. In this initiative, we addressed the incorporation of two critical design elements including computational funds of identity and computational thinking as a problem-solving method in support of inclusive technology-integrated practice and social justice in K-12 learning environments. We reviewed our design phases to address how we framed our design procedure, performed problem analysis, and formulated our design solutions. We prototyped our curriculum to gain insights on teacher candidates’ perceptions of the two incorporated design elements drawing on nuanced learning dynamics. This also enabled us to further refine the balance between our design inquiry and the teacher candidates’ diverse needs. We believe this narrative opens a story of how to advance teacher candidates’ technology competencies and computational thinking in a manner that embraces cultural relevance in response to the rapid development of emerging learning technologies. This in turn contributes to the current instructional design discourse by addressing the interdisciplinary nature of computer science education, educational technology, and social justice for teacher education.
Flexible Working Time (FWT) has traditionally been viewed as a workplace policy fostering family-friendly environments and enhancing employee productivity. However, the current comprehension of the impact of FWT on employees appears incomplete and fails to acknowledge the complex effects of FWT. According to the conservation of resources theory, this study examines the double-edged sword effects of FWT, and the moderating role of marital status, providing a more nuanced understanding of how FWT differently influences OCB towards organizations (OCBO) and individuals (OCBI). We tested our model using a three-wave time-lagged study with 267 employees in China. Results indicated that individual and relational energy play significant and opposing mediating roles in the relationship between FWT and OCBO/OCBI. Moreover, we found significant differences in these two paths for married and unmarried. This research contributes to scholarly discussions on FWT and offers novel insights for practitioners to implement FWT appropriately in their organizations.
ObjectivesWhile there is substantial evidence supporting the protective role of dispositional mindfulness against various anxiety disorders, its role in social anxiety (SA) is less well established. Some studies have associated negativity biases—related to the ooming maladaptive style—with mindfulness and SA. However, examining the interrelationships between these variables remains a clear challenge in literature. The objective of this study was to examine the predictive reciprocal relationships between mindfulness, SA, and looming.MethodA total of 575 vocational training students (Mage= 19.50,SD= 2.42) participated in a two-wave longitudinal study. SA, Looming, and three of five facets of mindfulness (Non-reactivity, Non-judging, and Acting with Awareness) were assessed. Statistical analyses included cross-lagged panel models to evaluate the directionality and strength of relationships between these variables over time.ResultsThe findings indicated that higher levels of SA predicted increased Looming and decreased levels of the three mindfulness facets. Additionally, a bidirectional relationship was observed between Looming and Non-reactivity, suggesting that these variables influence each other over time. Finally, no gender differences were found in the relationships between variables.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that higher levels of SA predicted lower levels of the three facets of mindfulness and highest levels of Looming. Additionally, according to the theoretical expectations, the study supports the bidirectional relationship between Non-reactivity and Looming.
Although there have been many studies on how regular physical exercise and reducing dependence on mobile phones can improve cervical dysfunction, there is currently a lack of model research to verify the interaction between the three. In addition, as a high-risk group for cervical spine dysfunction, college students' education level may have a moderating effect on this model, which will provide more targeted and effective suggestions for developing intervention strategies to improve cervical spine dysfunction in college students. From January 2023 to May 2023, an electronic questionnaire survey was conducted on 861 college students in the southwest region, with education levels including vocational, undergraduate, and graduate students, The survey content includes demographic information, the Physical Activity Rating Scale (PARS-3), the Mobile Phone Addiction Index (MAPI), and the Neck Disability Index (NDI). The PARS-3 of college students was negatively correlated with NDI (r = -0.142, p < 0.01), PARS-3 was negatively correlated with MAPI (r = -0.09, p < 0.01), MAPI was positively correlated with NDI (r = 0.353, p < 0.01), indicating that mobile phone dependency mediated the relationship between physical exercise and cervical spine dysfunction (P < 0.01); educational level could moderate the effect of physical exercise on cervical spine dysfunction (β = -0.06, p < 0.05). The physical exercise of college students in the southwestern region of China is negatively correlated with cervical spine dysfunction and mobile phone dependency; mobile phone dependency is positively correlated with cervical spine dysfunction; mobile phone dependency plays a mediating role between physical exercise and cervical spine dysfunction; the educational level of college students can to a certain extent moderate the impact of physical exercise on cervical spine dysfunction. Those with higher baseline education levels have a greater degree of improvement in NDI through physical exercise; On the contrary, people with lower levels of education have relatively less improvement in NDI through physical exercise.
The development of multimedia technology has given new life to the painting collection, forming a sharp contrast between the static collection and the dynamic exhibits. Studying the cognitive experience differences between static and dynamic exhibitions can better guide museum exhibit design and improve the quality of experience. In this paper, a combination of eye-tracking experiments and questionnaires will be used. A total of 40 volunteers were recruited to measure the presentation form and experience time in the museum exhibition, and to analyse the cognitive situation and perceptual experience of the visitors. It was found that (1) on the comparison of the presentation forms, it was found that at 5000 ms and 15,000 ms, the cognitive effect and stimulation experience of dynamic exhibitions are excellent, and the overall effectiveness is better. The emotional experience of dynamic exhibitions is significantly affected by the presentation time, and the experience of static exhibitions is significantly better at 25,000 ms and 35,000 ms. (2) On the comparison of experience time, it was found that the best feedback experience of subjects’ perceived information was observed in dynamic exhibitions at a presentation time of 15,000 ms, while the best feedback experience of subjects was observed in static exhibitions at a presentation time of 25,000 ms. The study can provide a certain scientific basis for this type of exhibition design.
ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the role of state policies in the contexts of accessing parenthood for sexual minority individuals and same-sex couples.BackgroundThese are LGBTQ people who want to have children face significant barriers for achieving parenthood, notably depending on the policies regulating access to assisted reproductive technologies, foster care, and adoption.MethodsWe use a national probability sample of 1507 sexual minority adults living across US states and belonging to three age cohorts.ResultsAlthough the proportion of LGBQ parents did not vary across the country, the pathways to parenthood did. In states with more inclusive policies, LGBQ parents accessed parenthood through formal (ART/adoption) or alternative pathways (co-parenting or step-parenting), whereas different-sex pathways were dominant in states with less inclusive policies.ConclusionState policy context is not associated with whether sexual minority adults are parents, but rather how they become parents.Policy ImplicationsAdditional policies could be implemented in order to protect sexual minority prospective parents from experiencing discrimination when they try to access adoption, foster care, or ART. Additionally, professionals and families could receive training about gender and sexual minority families.
BackgroundNotwithstanding the documented short- and long-term weight loss and remission of physical and mental diseases following bariatric surgery, a significant proportion of patients fail to respond (fully) to treatment in terms of physical and mental health improvement. Mounting evidence links food-specific impulsivity, prefrontal cortex (PFC) hypoactivity and disrupted hormone secretion in bariatric surgery candidates to poorer post-surgical health outcomes. Neuromodulatory treatments like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) uniquely target these neurobehavioral impairments. We present a pilot study protocol offering tDCS combined with an inhibitory control training and a structured psychosocial intervention to patients after bariatric surgery.MethodsA total ofN= 20 patients are randomized to 6 sessions of verum or sham tDCS over the PFC, combined with an individualized food-specific inhibitory control training and a structured psychosocial intervention within 18 months after bariatric surgery (t0). Beyond acceptability, feasibility and satisfaction of the intervention, effects of verum versus sham tDCS on food-specific impulsivity and on secondary outcomes quality of life, general impulsivity and psychopathology, food-related cravings, eating disorder psychopathology, weight trajectory and endocrine markers are assessed 4 weeks (t1) and 3 months after the intervention (t2).DiscussionResults will provide information on the potential of combining tDCS with an inhibitory control training and a structured psychosocial intervention to enhance physical and mental outcomes after bariatric surgery. The present study may guide the development of future research with regard to tDCS as a brain-based intervention and of future post-surgical clinical programs, paving the way for randomized-controlled trials in larger samples.Trial registrationThe trial was prospectively registered on July 8, 2024, under the registration number DRKS00034620 in the German Clinical Trials Register.
Starting from Moreno’s reflections on and reservations toward what he calledpsychodrama a deux, this paper, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie (ZPS), presents three contemporary models of one-to-one psychodrama work: open scene dramatization, internal psychodrama and relationship psychotherapy. I will present the underlying theoretical concepts to these models, their practical application, the techniques used, and the adaptations made in comparison to classical group psychodrama. I will then compare these three models from the perspective of the five instruments of psychodrama (stage, protagonist, director, auxiliary egos and audience), and finally also share some reflections on the online use of each model.
Empathy plays a crucial role in children’s social-emotional development. There is an increasing trend in recent studies to recognize empathy as a multi-dimensional construct, consisting of three distinct hierarchical levels: emotion contagion, attention to others’ feelings and prosocial behaviors (Hoffman,Motiv Emot, 14(2), 151–172, 1990). The present study is amongst the first to use a longitudinal approach to examine the development trajectories of the distinct empathic levels, based on a sample of Chinese preschoolers aged 2 to 6 years, half of the sample being deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH). Our results showed that according to the parental observation, DHH preschoolers manifested similar extent of emotion contagion and attention to others’ feelings as their TH (typically hearing) peers over preschool years. Yet, DHH preschoolers showed fewer prosocial behaviors, compared to their TH peers. As for the longitudinal associations over time, emotion contagion contributed to more internalizing and externalizing behaviors in both groups; whilst attention to others’ feelings contributed to fewer internalizing behaviors in only DHH children. Prosocial behaviors contributed to better social competence, and fewer internalizing and externalizing behaviors in both DHH and TH children just as expected. These outcomes imply that the early intervention or special education may be useful to safeguard children’s empathic development, shrinking the gaps between DHH and TH children; but meanwhile, cultural factors might cause latent effects on children’s understandings of empathy and impact on how empathy “regulates” children’s social-emotional functioning, in a Chinese cultural context.
ObjectivesAppreciative joy, one of the four immeasurables in Buddhism, has been widely incorporated into mindfulness literature. However, current measurements of appreciative joy have various limitations, including the inability to capture the concept of appreciative joy, strong correlations between dimensions, and a lack of sensitivity to short-term changes. This study aimed to address these limitations by developing a Short-Term Appreciative Joy Scale (SAJS) to measure appreciative joy over 2 weeks.MethodIn Study 1, exploratory factor analysis (n= 325) and confirmatory factor analysis (n= 210) were used to validate the factor structure of the SAJS. Study 2 (n= 273) used correlation analysis to test the criterion validity and incremental validity of the SAJS. Study 3 (n= 499) further used a randomized controlled trial to investigate the application of the SAJS in a loving-kindness and compassion meditation intervention.ResultsStudy 1 identified a 15-item SAJS with three factors: appreciation, joy, and non-envy. Study 2 revealed that scores on the non-envy dimension were negatively related to negative emotions, negative attitudes toward others, and envy, even after controlling for trait appreciative joy. Study 3 further revealed that scores on the appreciation and joy dimensions improved significantly after the intervention and mediated the changes in positive emotions and prosocial attitudes.ConclusionThe SAJS is a reliable and valid measure of appreciative joy, and its sensitivity to short-term change makes it useful for intervention.PreregistrationThis study is not preregistered.
Parents of children with autism often experience a wide range of emotions in their daily lives. However, previous research has primarily focused on average levels of emotional challenges, neglecting the significance of daily emotion dynamics that may underlie parental psychological functioning. This study adopted a dynamic network approach to examine the strength of temporal connections within and between various emotions—referred to as emotion network density—and further explore its impacts on parental psychological distress. Participants included 76 Chinese parents (M= 36.36 years,SD= 3.95 years; 58 mothers) of children with autism. Parents reported their psychological distress at baseline and then completed measures of daily emotions over a 14-day period. The densities of overall, positive, and negative emotion networks were estimated using the Multilevel Vector Auto-Regression model. The results indicated that higher densities of the overall and negative emotion networks were associated with increased stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in parents. Further analysis of network components showed that the in-strength of fear and guilt (i.e., their likelihood of being affected by other emotions) and the out-strength of anger and guilt (i.e., their capacity to influence other emotions) were positively related to parental psychological distress. However, neither the overall density of the positive emotion network nor its specific components showed a significant relationship with parental psychological distress. These findings highlight the importance of considering the daily dynamics of emotions, particularly negative emotions, from a network perspective to better understand the development of psychological distress in parents of children with autism.
The purpose of this study was to inspect the psychometric properties of a newly developed measure, the General Inventory of Behaviours, Symptoms, and Opinions (GIBSO), and its efficacy in capturing underreporting. Students (N= 169) were randomly allocated to five conditions, (1) honest control (n= 35), and four groups of concealers: (2) psychological symptoms (n= 36), (3) antisocial behaviour (n= 33), (4) somatic complaints (n= 29), and (5) sexual deviance (n= 36). All participants received instructions corresponding to their group allocation and then received symptom inventories of all tested domains, the Supernormality Scale (SS), and GIBSO. Overall, honest participants obtained significantly higher scores on all symptom inventories and exhibited significantly lower underreporting measured by SS and GIBSO than the concealing groups. Further, using GIBSO’s cut-off point of > 20, the classification accuracy was satisfactory, with both sensitivity and specificity at .80 (AUC= .86). Our findings suggest that the GIBSO is a promising measure of symptom and behaviour concealment. However, further investigation involving both general and forensic samples is essential to confirm its efficacy.
The social support paradox describes mixed findings on the effects of social support on well-being. An application of the person-environment fit perspective can address the paradox by reasoning that similar quantities of social support needs and social support supplies should result in optimal well-being outcomes. We integrate a person-environment fit perspective with self-determination theory in an examination of the relationship between workplace instrumental support and emotional exhaustion through a two-week experience sampling method study. Fifty-nine participants responded to questions about desired quantities of work-related help from their colleagues (coworkers and supervisors) and their perceived quantities of work-related help after work and before bed. Participants responded to questions about their emotional exhaustion levels before bed. We utilized polynomial regression and response surface analyses to examine within-person. Within-person results indicate astressor effect,such that daily unmet support needs are associated with daily higher emotional exhaustion.
Neuroscientists in decision science have advanced an affect-integration-motivation (AIM) framework, demonstrating that neural activity associated with positive affect or value integration can predict individual and aggregate choice. Given that individuals with higher interoceptive sensibility (IS) have tendency to engage their bodily sensations and thus exhibit a more coherent pattern between their neural, affective, and behavioral measures, we investigated how IS may interact with the affective/integrative components for predicting individual and aggregate choice. Thus, we 1) explored neural underpinnings of individual choice, affective ratings, aggregate outcomes, 2) examined how the above-mentioned measures predict individual and aggregate choices on mobile games, and 3) tested the moderation effect of IS by comparing the differences in how these measures perform in prediction models between subgroups of IS. Neuroimaging results showed that individual choice associated with NAcc activity, aggregate download rate tracked by regions in salience network, and revenue additionally tracked by regions in motor tendency and attention regulation. Affective ratings and AIns activity predicted individual download choice; mPFC activity forecasted aggregate download rate, and positive arousal forecasted aggregate revenue. As hypothesized, the high IS group displayed coherent correlations between affective ratings, individual choice, and neural measures. More importantly, at the aggregate level, mPFC activity (integrative component), forecasted aggregate download rate above and beyond ratings and individual choice in the high IS group, with this prediction significantly stronger compared with the low IS group. These findings extend the AIM framework by shedding light on the influence of interoceptive sensibility on the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying human decision-making.
Leaders significantly shape organizational culture and determine collective efficacy, which includes managing errors. They can act as role models to encourage team members' engagement by framing mistakes as opportunities for learning instead of hiding or punishing them. Scholars widely recognize that both leadership and culture have a significant impact on employee performance. However, only a few studies have explored the simultaneous influence of these factors on performance, and the nature of these relationships remains unclear. Furthermore, few studies have empirically investigated the association between leadership, error culture, and workplace errors. Thus, this study explores whether and how different profiles of leadership behavior influence error culture approaches, thereby influencing the occurrence of errors. Our aims are a) to identify potential profiles of leadership styles by employing a person-centered approach and b) to examine how a range of leadership profiles are associated with different cultural approaches toward errors, thus paving the way to workplace errors. We identified four leadership profiles with specific contributions to the error culture approach. The model, tested with an SEM mediation analysis on a sample of 388 Italian workers, showed that a) the different styles contribute to the error-handling process by differently affecting the error management, strain, and covering approaches to errors and that b) their relationship with workplace errors is fully mediated by cultural approaches to errors. The findings support an integrative perspective on leadership, with leaders embodying multiple leadership styles, each configuration expressing a different interplay among styles and uniquely affecting cultural approaches to workplace errors.
BackgroundA large proportion of individuals experience functional impairment in everyday life due to climate worry. However, the current understanding of this functional impairment is limited by the use of suboptimal measures. Furthermore, it is not known whether functional impairment due to climate worry affects pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) or whether individuals who experience such impairment perceive a need for support. The aims of the current study were (1) to extend previous research using an established measure of functional impairment (the Work and Social Adjustment Scale, WSAS), (2) to explore the associations between climate worry, functional impairment, and PEBs, and (3) to describe the characteristics and the perceived need for support of individuals with functional impairment due to climate worry.MethodsA cross-sectional survey targeting adult individuals who experience climate worry. Participants were recruited nationally in Sweden between September and October 2022. The survey included measures of climate worry severity, climate worry frequency, functional impairment, PEBs, depressive symptoms, sleep problems, and questions related to perceived need for support.ResultsA total of 1221 adults (75% women, mean age 46.3 years) were included in the analyses. Multivariate structural equation modeling revealed that climate worry severity and frequency were significantly associated with PEBs (β = 0.34 and β = 0.45, respectively). Climate worry frequency was associated with functional impairment (β = 0.41). Functional impairment was only marginally associated with PEBs (β = 0.05). Approximately 40% of the sample (n= 484) reported a high frequency and high severity of climate worry. Among these, one-third (n= 153) scored above the cutoff for significant impairment on the WSAS. Individuals in this group (high severity and frequency of climate worry as well as significant functional impairment) were more likely to experience depressed mood and sleep problems and were more interested in receiving support, specifically concerning strategies for worry management and sustainable behavior change.ConclusionsUsing an established measure of functional impairment, we found an association of climate worry with functional impairment and PEBs. Importantly, as there is a perceived need for support in individuals with impairment due to climate worry, interventions targeting this specific subgroup should be developed.
Although not typically within their primary duties, training, or educational background, police frequently encounter individuals with mental disorders or severe mental crises. These encounters are often characterized by uncertainty among police officers in assessing individuals' behavior and potential danger, and they do not always proceed free of conflict. Consequently, people with mental illnesses are more frequently subjected to police coercive measures or even police violence. Given the limited research on the perspectives of individuals with mental illnesses in police interactions, this study aimed to explore the subjective perceptions of people with mental illness (PMI) regarding conflictual encounters with police and to analyze de-escalating and escalating police behavior from their perspective. Another aim was to receive recommendations from the participants on how police should behave in such situations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 PMI who had resisted police actions or attacked police officers during encounters. Findings revealed a lack of understanding among participants regarding police actions and a feeling of being overwhelmed by the use of force. A calm and empathetic initial approach, coupled with clear communication and explanation, was identified as critical for de-escalation. Results underscore the importance of perceived procedural justice in reducing resistance among PMI. Enhancing police training with a focus on mental health awareness, communication skills, and empathy could potentially improve interactions and outcomes between police and PMI.
Breastfeeding is hypothesised to benefit child health and cognitive functioning by providing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are essential for brain development. In 2007, Caspi et al.found evidence in two cohorts for an interaction between genetic variation in theFADS2gene (a gene involved in fatty acid metabolism) and breastfeeding on IQ. However, subsequent studies have provided mixed evidence for the existence of an interaction. We investigated the relationship between genetic variation in theFADS2region, breastfeeding, and their interaction in up to 335,650 individuals from the UK Biobank. We tested for the interaction over a range of cognitive functioning tests, as well as educational attainment and other traits thought to be influenced by breastfeeding, including cardiometabolic traits, number of offspring, and atopic allergy.FADS2alleles associated with an increase in docosahexaenoic acid in blood serum (the C allele of rs174575) were associated with decreased verbal-numerical reasoning (\(p=2.28\times {10}^{-5}\)) and triglycerides (\(p=1.40\times {10}^{-41}\)), increased number of offspring (\(p=3.40\times {10}^{-5}\)), total cholesterol (\(p=5.28\times {10}^{-36}\)), HDL (\(p=1.42\times {10}^{-51}\)), and LDL cholesterol (\(p=1.46\times {10}^{-21}\)). We observed no evidence of an interaction in any of the traits, regardless of the modelling strategy on any cognitive or non-cognitive traits. We postulate that the previous positive findings are likely to be spurious, perhaps due to lack of appropriate control for latent population structure.
Time-out is an empirically supported component of parenting interventions for child conduct problems; however, it is receiving increasing criticism among parents and some practitioners. This study aimed to investigate practitioners’ use and acceptability of time-out for child conduct problems; examine whether perceived effectiveness and knowledge of evidence-based parameters of time-out implementation influence use and acceptability of time-out; and explore practitioners’ perceptions about alternatives to time-out. One hundred and ten Australian and New Zealand practitioners who have worked with children and families completed an online survey investigating their use and acceptability of time-out for children with conduct problems. Results showed that 55.5% of the sample have used timeout, with 38.0% considered current TO users. Acceptability of the strategy varied, with some practitioners critical of time-out. Increased knowledge of evidence-based parameters of time-out implementation was associated with increased frequency of time-out use and acceptability, while perceived effectiveness was associated with increased acceptability only. Practitioners perceived a number of other parenting strategies as effective alternatives to time-out. These findings have important implications for improving practitioners’ implementation of time-out with parents of children with conduct problems.
This article, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie (ZPS), underlines the theory of mentalizing as a multidisciplinary point of reference for all psychotherapy methods. It helps to explain the therapeutic effects of Psychodrama and Katathym Imaginative Psychotherapy (KIP) on the basis of an inherently systematic theory. The authors point out similarities and differences between the two methods and ask two questions to KIP therapists at the end.
This article, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziomterie (ZPS), describes applications of one-to-one psychodrama in a particularly interesting individual supervision. A professional conflict between the supervisee and her superior (manager) turned out to be profound. The key to the solution lay in uncovering transgenerational traces in the client’s family history, which had their roots in the complex structure of a socialist society. The use of the psychodramatic interview technique as well as knowledge about the ‘creative circle’, empty chair work, role reversal, doubling and the use of soft toys were helpful. The work revealed parts of a ‘post-socialist personality’. It is particularly difficult for them to experience themselves as independent in a conflict, to show themselves and to assert themselves. Instead, aggressive impulses tend to be expressed in a submissive or paradoxical manner. In addition to describing the use of specific psychodramatic techniques, a link is made to Fonagy’s concept of ‘mentalisation’, which sheds light on the underlying effectiveness of the use of one-to-one psychodrama in supervision.
ObjectivesResearch suggests that self-compassion, characterized by an open and caring attitude toward oneself during challenging situations, can serve as a protective factor against mental health challenges. In research and clinical practice, self-compassion is typically assessed using the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS). Although the short form of the SCS (SCS-SF) has been studied in Sweden, the full SCS remains relatively unexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Swedish translation of the SCS in a university student population.MethodWe assessed internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and factor structure using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM). Additionally, we assessed the concurrent validity of the SCS by correlating it with perceived stress and alcohol consumption.ResultsThe results of the CFA and ESEM analyses indicated adequate fit for the 6-factor model, whereas the 1-factor and 2-factor models showed inadequate fit. The 1-bifactor and 2-bifactor ESEM analyses also indicated adequate fit, but the corresponding CFA analyses did not converge. As expected, self-compassion correlated negatively with perceived stress and alcohol consumption.ConclusionOur findings support the reliability of the Swedish version of the SCS. These psychometric properties are comparable to those of the original version. This validation is essential for its use in Swedish research and clinical contexts.PreregistrationThis study was not preregistered.
There is evidence that children with autism/autistic traits have higher risks of incontinence and constipation, but no studies have examined this in a large community-based cohort. Aim/Research question: are autistic traits and diagnosed autism prospectively associated with increased odds of incontinence and constipation in children and adolescents? This was a population-based cohort study based on data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n = 4233–4490 at age 9 years; n = 3403–3697 at age 14). We used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations of parent-reported autistic traits (sociability, repetitive behaviours, social-communication, coherence) (at ages 3–9 years) and autism with incontinence (bedwetting, daytime-wetting, soiling) and constipation (parent-reported at age 9, self-reported at age 14). We adjusted for parity, maternal age at delivery, child’s sex and developmental level, maternal depression, and anxiety (antenatal and postnatal), and indicators of family socioeconomic status. Social-communication and speech coherence difficulties showed the strongest associations with incontinence, e.g., adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between social-communication difficulties and daytime-wetting was 2.21 (1.47–3.32) and for coherence was 2.34 (1.60–3.43). The odds of soiling were also higher in children with social-communication (OR: 1.88, 95% CI 1.28–2.75) and coherence difficulties (OR: 2.04, 95% CI 1.43–2.93). Diagnosed autism was only associated with an increase in the odds of daytime-wetting (OR: 3.18, 95% CI 1.44–7.02). At 14 years, there was less evidence of associations between autistic traits and incontinence but there was evidence of associations between autistic traits and constipation: social-communication (OR: 1.68, 95% CI 1.13–2.49), coherence difficulties (OR: 1.64, 95% CI 1.11–2.41). Early assessment and treatment of incontinence/constipation should be considered for children with autistic traits.
The impact of career adaptability on turnover intention has been inconsistent and inadequately explained. Drawing on career construction theory, this study hypothesizes that career adaptability influences turnover intention indirectly through job dissatisfaction, exhibiting a U-shaped relationship. Specifically, moderate levels of career adaptability are hypothesized to reduce turnover intention by decreasing job dissatisfaction. Furthermore, this study proposes that age may serve as a significant moderator, impacting the relationships among career adaptability, job dissatisfaction, and turnover intention. To validate these hypotheses, a three-wave time-lagged study involving 349 employees from Chinese firms demonstrated that career adaptability exerts a curvilinear effect on job dissatisfaction, which in turn nonlinearly mediated the relationship between career adaptability and turnover intention. Additionally, age moderated these relationships. The data supported these hypotheses. This paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.
Childhood emotional maltreatment is a crucial risk factor for gratitude in adolescents. However, previous research has not investigated the effects of two types of emotional maltreatment (i.e., emotional abuse and emotional neglect) on gratitude, and explored the underlying mechanisms. To address existing research gaps, this study investigated how childhood emotional maltreatment affected adolescent gratitude, as well as the potential role of parent-child attachment in the Chinese context. A total of 491 Chinese adolescents from a public high school (Mage= 16.19 years,SD= 0.50; 60.5% female) participated in this 10-month, three-wave longitudinal study. The path analysis revealed that cumulative childhood emotional maltreatment and childhood emotional neglect at T1 predicted lower levels of gratitude at T3, while childhood emotional abuse did not. Additionally, parent-child attachment at T2 mediated the relationship between cumulative childhood emotional maltreatment at T1 and gratitude at T3. These findings underscore the enduring negative impact of childhood emotional maltreatment on adolescent gratitude and highlight the crucial role of parent-child attachment in this relationship.
Maltreated adolescents placed in the out-of-home care (OHC) system often experience multiple adversities, which are associated with many deleterious outcomes. The present study investigated the longitudinal effects of cumulative adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on internalizing and externalizing problems among adolescents in OHC, as well as the extent to which emotion dysregulation can explain the links between exposure to multiple adversities and problematic behavioral outcomes over time. One hundred and sixty-two adolescents (Mage= 13.11 years, 90 females) who were placed in OHC in Singapore self-reported on their adversities experienced and symptoms of emotion dysregulation at baseline, as well as internalizing and externalizing problems in two consecutive waves. Path analyses indicated that cumulative ACEs were positively associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems at Wave 1, which in turn were positively related to internalizing and externalizing problems at Wave 2. Emotion dysregulation at Wave 1 partially explained the paths. These findings highlight the importance of addressing emotion dysregulation and the associated internalizing and externalizing problems in early interventions for adolescents in OHC to mitigate the risks of deteriorating mental health and promote positive outcomes.
The escalating prevalence of shift work among female intern nurses in China necessitates a nuanced exploration of its impact on fatigue and insomnia symptoms. While prior studies acknowledge the coexistence of these distresses in shift workers, a detailed understanding of their inter-connectedness at the symptom level is lacking. This study delves into the network dynamics of fatigue and insomnia symptoms, aiming to unravel the changes before and after the initial shift work transition among female intern nurses. Through three waves of surveys conducted at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months post-transition, we employed the 11-item Chalder Fatigue Scales for fatigue assessment and three items aligned with the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for insomnia evaluation. Network analysis was conducted to estimate centrality and bridge centrality, comparing network properties before and after the shift work transition. Notably, "Difficulty starting things," "Difficulty maintaining sleep," and "Sleepy or drowsy" emerged as central symptoms with higher centrality indices post-transition, exhibiting significant differences compared to the pre-shift work period. The gradual strengthening of the global fatigue-insomnia network further underscores the evolving dynamics following the transition to shift work. This study accentuates the pivotal role of these three symptoms in activating or being activated within the fatigue-insomnia network among female intern nurses post-shift work transition. Consequently, we propose the development of targeted prevention and intervention strategies to alleviate fatigue and insomnia symptoms in female intern nurses navigating their first-time shift work experience from a network perspective.
Under high-pressure situations, complex cognition and behavior frequently exhibit performance decrements, commonly known as choking under pressure. Complex cognition and behavior are primarily composed of three core components: behavior execution, inhibition, and switching. However, choking does not stem from decreases in all behavior components but primarily from failures in inhibition and switching. This study aims to further investigate whether performance pressure reduces performance in inhibition and switching and whether cue priming can alleviate choking on these two behaviors. Participants were assigned at random to the pressure group or the control group. Subsequently, they completed a modified version of the behavior variation task, during which they were instructed to make executive, inhibitory, or switching responses to forthcoming stimuli based on prior cues. The previous cues were categorized into three types: positive cues correctly indicating subsequent target behavior, negative cues incorrectly indicating subsequent behavior, and no cues. Results showed that performance pressure did not decrease performance in behavior execution, but had a negative impact on inhibition and switching. Importantly, positive cues were found to mitigate performance decrements in inhibition and switching, while negative cues or no cues did not affect choking in either behavior. Our results offer support for the distraction theory. These findings offer new perspectives on understanding the causes of choking and developing successful intervention approaches.
Shame and guilt are universal emotions meant to elicit socially approved behaviors and inhibit antisocial behavior. Excessive feelings of shame and guilt—shame especially—are linked to various destructive behaviors, difficulties in emotion regulation, maladaptive personality traits, psychological difficulties, and negative impacts on treatment outcomes. These make it especially important to have a valid instrument to evaluate the mechanisms related to these emotions. No validated self-report instrument measuring generalized shame and guilt was available in Norwegian. The Personal Feelings Questionnaire (PFQ-2) is designed to measure the level of generalized shame and guilt. This project’s aim was to translate the PFQ-2 into Norwegian and evaluate the clinical utility and psychometric properties of a Norwegian version of the PFQ-2. Data were collected from students at a local university college in Norway (N= 320, age:M= 25.4,SD= 8) and patients at a local outpatient psychiatric hospital (N= 53, age:M= 31.4,SD= 10.43). To be able to evaluate the factor structure of the Norwegian version of the PFQ-2, the dataset was divided in two by random selection with a 50/50 split. First an Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on one half of the sample (N= 180) and then a Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the other half (N= 193). According to the EFA the factor structure was similar to the original factor structure, with the exception of one item (item 6). Confirmatory factor analysis showed a good goodness of fit for the two factors measuring shame and guilt. The internal consistency was high in both subscales (shame, α = 0.818, and guilt, α = 0.834). The instrument showed further adequate construct validity, where the clinical sample experienced greater shame than the community sample (M= 17,SD= 6.887 vs.M= 13,SD= 5.311) and stronger guilt (M= 18,SD= 5.248 vs.M= 14,SD= 15.210). The subscales correlated with other constructs, as expected. The PFQ-2—with the suggested adjustment of moving one item (item 6) from the shame scale to the guilt scale—can be used to evaluate the levels of feelings of shame and guilt among adults in Norway.
I conducted a qualitative study to explore the unknown resistance experience and gender equality truth of transgenders in Punjab, Pakistan, considering rulings on transgender laws made by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2018. The literacy rate in the transgender community is meager, so data was gathered through extensive interviews to document the study participants’ subjective evaluation using the purposive sampling method. The thematic analysis demonstrates how society has compromised on mental health and gender equality of transgenders, but why transgenders are living their lives with hope? Findings revealed that individual resilience, religious beliefs, cruel optimism, and psychological resilience are the major factors that contribute positively to transgenders’ lives at the social and psychological levels. The research goal is to compile and emphasize research findings that would guide practical interventions to enhance the resilience of transgenders and mitigate mental health vulnerabilities. The study will also contribute progressively to transgender literature and develop real-world solutions and policies that may be used at the communal level across Pakistan.
A growing number of families in the US are caring for children with identified disabilities. As demonstrated in previous studies, there is reason to be concerned about the economic well-being of children with disabilities and their families. However, much of the existing evidence is drawn from older data that do not reflect recent increases in disability diagnoses or relevant economic and policy changes. Using recent nationally representative data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we offer updated evidence on the economic well-being of households of children with disabilities. Our regression models suggest that families with a child with a disability are more likely to experience food insecurity, and, on average, have lower income-to-poverty ratios than other households with children. We discuss implications for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers.
COVID-19 arrived in Spain during times of great political turmoil. General elections held in November 2019 resulted in a weak left-leaning coalition government and a highly polarized two-bloc party system; this set the stage for daily political confrontation on how to “best” manage the COVID-19 crisis. This study sought experimental evidence on the factors accounting for political polarization regarding the government’s implementation of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Participants (147 leftists, 162 rightists) were randomly assigned to a control or two experimental conditions, wherein they were induced to believe that individuals holdingfavorableorunfavorableattitudes towards NPIs were generally more analytical and open-minded. The extent to which participants believed the information presented in the experimental manipulation was thought to depend on motivated reasoning, on whether such information was congenial to their political ideology and related stance on NPIs. The results revealed that, (1) compared to leftists, rightists held stronger conspiracy beliefs regarding vaccines and COVID-19, religious beliefs, and psychological reactance towards NPIs, and less beliefs in science and open-minded thinking about evidence; (2) leftists and rightists were equally motivated to view individuals of opposite political ideology as less analytical and open-minded, (3) rightists reported less favorable attitudes towards NPIs and lower trust in the government than leftists; (4) motivated reasoning partly accounted for political polarization, widening the gap on attitudes towards NPIs and trust in government between leftists and rightists in the experimental (not control) conditions.
As a set of fundamental beliefs that underlie social attitudes and behaviors, social axioms (i.e., social cynicism, fate control, reward for application, religiosity, and social complexity) play a central role in how individuals maintain self-esteem and life satisfaction when encountering challenges and adversities in the social world. Existing knowledge regarding the impact of social axioms on psychological well-being is inconclusive, and there is a lack of longitudinal research to investigate whether social axioms are associated with psychological well-being over time. Most previous studies focused on the influence of social axioms on cognitive aspects of well-being (e.g., life purpose and self-esteem), but the affective aspects (i.e., positive and negative feelings) have been seldom investigated. To address this research gap, we conducted a two-wave survey among 333 Chinese university students and found that the baseline social axioms predicted the follow-up psychological well-being. Social cynicism was negatively related to flourishing and positive feelings, and positively related to negative feelings. Fate control was positively related to flourishing and positive feelings. Gender played a moderating role between social cynicism and flourishing. The findings gain our understanding of how social axioms affect psychological well-being over time and inspire new ideas for emotion regulation and well-being promotion.
ObjectivesIn this qualitative study, we explored Dutch secondary vocational schoolteachers’ prior expectations of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training. We report on their short- and long-term experiences regarding mental health outcomes and personal or mindfulness/prosocial competencies.MethodBetween September 2016 and June 2020, we interviewed 32 teachers participating in a cluster randomised controlled trial prior to partaking in a MBSR training (T0); 27, immediately after the training (T1); and 16, 9 months after finishing the training (T3). No interviews were held on T2, 3 months after finishing the training. Qualitative data was analysed using directed content analysis.ResultsAnalysis of the data at T0resulted in five themes regarding the participants’ prior expectations related to the MBSR training. Data analysis at T1and T3resulted in 10 themes regarding their experiences, four of which were the same as at T0: one mental health outcome (i.e. stress and unpleasant feelings) and three personal competencies (i.e. being in the present, taking distance, and recognising and changing dysfunctional patterns). The fifth "other" theme at T0was knowledge of mindfulness and of mindfulness skills. Six additional themes emerged related to a new mental health outcome (i.e. inner calmness and pleasant feelings) and five personal competencies (i.e. being aware, concentration, acceptance and non-judgment, communicating, and showing compassion towards yourself and others).ConclusionOur results suggest that MBSR can reduce teachers’ stress, increase inner calmness, and foster mindfulness and prosocial competencies.PreregistrationThe trial was registered with the Dutch Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl): NL5581 (July 2016).
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, some psychological changes have been tracked and reported across the world. Post-COVID-19 freshman university students can be classified as generation Z. The aim of this study was to examine changes in moral and moral-related variables among Iranian Freshman University students in generation Z compared with generation Y, in the post-COVID-19 era. Variables, including prosocial behaviors, types of prosocial moral reasoning, dimensions of moral identity and religiosity, identity styles, empathy, and social desirability, were assessed among 212 freshman students at Salman Farsi University of Kazerun in 2014. However, another assessment of those variables by the same measures and methods was performed among 114 similar students in 2022. Social desirability and lie/nonsense responses were statistically controlled by multiple analysis of covariance and partial correlation methods. Among the post-COVID group, there was less total prosocial moral reasoning, hedonistic, approval-oriented and internalized prosocial moral reasoning, normative identity, symbolization of moral identity, public prosocial behavior, and total, ideological and experimental religiosity; additionally, there was more needs-oriented and stereotypic prosocial moral reasoning, informational identity, altruistic prosocial behaviors, consequential and ritualistic religiosity and empathy. There were different correlations among the two groups, whereas religiosity and its dimensions were positively correlated with many moral variables in the 2014 group, the correlations were negative in the 2022 group. The findings indicate that in this Iranian post-COVID-19 generation Z, sentimental aspects (e.g., empathy and altruism) of morality increased and that rational (e.g., prosocial moral reasoning) or traditional (e.g., religiosity) aspects decreased.
PurposeEarthquakes have serious psychosocial and emotional effects on children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their parents. The limited number of studies investigating the earthquake experience of children with ASD and their parents indicates a need to improve existing research in this area. The aim of this study was to assess parents’ experiences with their children after the earthquake and their reactions to the earthquake.MethodsThis study was subjected to analysis via both phenomenological and thematic analysis methods on the basis of the results of semistructured interviews with the parents of 21 children with ASD who were receiving their education in special education and rehabilitation centers.ResultsTwo principal themes were discerned: the first theme, entitled Post-Eartquake Responses in Children and the second, entitled Parents’ Earthquake Experiences and Coping Strategies, were identified. Earthquakes had a significant effect on children’s bodily, behavioural and emotional responses. In addition, parents were compelled to devise a range of coping strategies to manage their emotional responses to the earthquake and to facilitate their children’s access to constrained educational opportunities and adapt to evolving social dynamics.ConclusionIn disaster situations, access to multidisciplinary support programs for children diagnosed with ASD and their families is highly important. These programs, designed through collaboration across various fields of expertise, can offer comprehensive solutions to the emotional, social, and physical challenges faced by children and their families.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant influence on people’s life, affecting social and economic conditions, population dynamics, politics, and cultural activities. This study investigates how COVID-19 affects married people’s fertility preferences. It also analyzes the preferences of married persons in Bangladesh with and without COVID-19. The study hypothesizes that persons afflicted with the pandemic choose to have more children than uninfected ones. A survey questionnaire and in-depth interview questions were used to gather pertinent data via snowball sampling from 200 infected and uninfected individuals residing in Sylhet City Corporation, Bangladesh, who were between the ages of 15 and 50. The study employed a mixed method strategy, including quantitative analysis (binary logistic regression), ANOVA testing, Chi-Square testing, and thematic analysis of qualitative data to examine the association between COVID-19 and fertility decisions. The results of the study show that the pandemic significantly affects people’s reproductive preferences, in particular their desire to have or not to have children in the future. In addition, compared with people who are not infected with COVID-19, people who have been infected are more likely to want to have children in the future. The study also shows that people - married couples in particular - may think twice before choosing to have children if they suffer the adverse consequences of an unforeseen shock such as a pandemic in the future. By examining the socioeconomic and cultural context of Bangladesh, this study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced fertility preferences. By addressing demographic shifts during and after the pandemic, it offers important insights for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals. Additionally, this study will advance knowledge of how pandemics alter reproductive desires globally and make results available for future cross-regional comparisons.
This study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the Quiet Quitting Scale (QQS) among healthcare workers. After completing the language validation, the psychometric properties of the QQS were tested on a sample of 542 healthcare workers from two hospitals in Turkey. Convergent validity was examined using the Burnout Measure-Short Version (BMS). The reliability of the scale was evaluated through internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and split-half reliability. Factor analysis confirmed the one-dimensional structure of the QQS with its seven items. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.81, the intraclass correlation coefficient for the total score was 0.91, and the Spearman-Brown coefficient for split-half reliability was 0.80. Additionally, the test-retest reliability was found to be high. A correlation coefficient of 0.79 between the QQS and BMS confirmed the scale’s convergent validity. These results suggest that the Turkish version of the QQS is a valid and reliable tool for measuring quiet quitting behavior in healthcare workers. Further research with different sample groups is recommended.
The importance of data sharing in organizational science is well-acknowledged, yet the field faces hurdles that prevent this, including concerns around privacy, proprietary information, and data integrity. We propose that synthetic data generated using machine learning (ML) could offer one promising solution to surmount at least some of these hurdles. Although this technology has been widely researched in the field of computer science, most organizational scientists are not familiar with it. To address the lack of available information for organizational scientists, we propose a systematic framework for the generation and evaluation of synthetic data. This framework is designed to guide researchers and practitioners through the intricacies of applying ML technologies to create robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data. Additionally, we present two empirical demonstrations using the ML method of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to illustrate the practical application and potential of synthetic data in organizational science. Through this exploration, we aim to furnish the community with a foundational understanding of synthetic data generation and encourage further investigation and adoption of these methodologies. By doing so, we hope to foster scientific advancement by enhancing data-sharing initiatives within the field.
This study explores the interplay between Fantastic Reality Ability (FRA), assessed using the FRAME scale, and playfulness, measured with the OLIW-S, in relation to cognitive emotion regulation strategies among 298 Israeli adults. Participants completed self-report measures evaluating FRA, playfulness, and emotion regulation processes. Results revealed robust positive associations between FRA and various facets of playfulness, and specific connections to adaptive emotion regulation. Particularly, higher levels of FRA coping and lighthearted playfulness emerged as significant predictors of adaptive emotion regulation, while maladaptive regulation showed associations with lower FRA control and distinct playfulness facets. These findings highlight the potential of cultivating imaginative capabilities and embracing playful approaches to bolster emotional resilience and adaptive coping strategies during challenging circumstances and crises. Practical implications for interventions aimed at enhancing psychological well-being are discussed, emphasizing the integration of FRA and playfulness in developing effective coping strategies.
BackgroundPositive marital relations are crucial for healthy family functioning, whereas conflict-ridden marital relations are linked to children’s adjustment problems. According to the Emotional Security Theory, destructive interparental conflict leads to children’s emotional insecurity, impacting their adjustment.ObjectiveThis three-wave longitudinal study examined the temporal associations between preschool children’s reactions to interparental conflict, interparental conflict and children’s behavioral problems in Japan.MethodsWe conducted a longitudinal three-wave study with Japanese parents of children at three time points: aged 3 (Time 1), 4 (Time 2), and 5 (Time 3). Children’s reactions to interparental conflict at Time 2 were assessed using the Security in the Marital Subsystem-Parent Report, which includes subscales for overt emotional reactivity, behavioral dysregulation, overt avoidance, and overt involvement.ResultsOur findings revealed a positive association between behavioral dysregulation at Time 2 and internalizing problems at Time 3. However, no significant association was found between behavioral dysregulation and externalizing problems. Emotional reactivity was not associated with behavioral problems or interparental conflict. Differences in age ranges across studies may account for the variance in findings.ConclusionsThis longitudinal study highlights the importance of focusing on behavioral dysregulation in preschool children as a factor associated with the relationship between interparental conflict and internalizing problems over time. Emotional reactivity may not serve as a reliable indicator of behavioral problems or interparental conflict in Japanese contexts. These findings underscore the need for culturally sensitive approaches in assessing children’s responses to interparental conflict and their potential associations with child development over time.
Research on alphabetic reading presents conflicting findings concerning the timing of orthographic and meaning processes in reading morphologically complex words. Chinese characters offer distinct visual cues for morphemes, enabling straightforward manipulations to examine orthographic and meaning processes. Guided by the Character-Word Dual Function model, we report four priming experiments that test how a reader’s lexical quality impacts the emergence of orthographic and semantic priming effects in reading Chinese compounds. We conducted comparisons between native Chinese speakers and Chinese L2 learners, who vary in their quality of lexical representations. By manipulating the semantic transparency of prime-target pairs, we distinguished meaning from orthographic effects. The emergence of these effects was revealed by varying prime exposure durations. Orthographic effects emerged at shorter exposures for both L1 and L2 readers. However, meaning effects appeared at longer exposure durations only for L1 readers. These results confirm the generality of the orthography-first emergence of morphological effect in reading Chinese and suggest that readers’ access to morphological meaning relations increases with experience.
Mindfulness-based interventions are increasingly utilized not only to enhance health and wellness in the face of disease and disorder but also to manage stress, anxiety, and daily worries. However, their application has been limited among diverse populations. A Special Section ofMindfulnesshighlights emerging research focused on inclusivity, diversity, equity, and accessibility in mindfulness-based interventions, as well as studies on child, parent, and family well-being. These studies provide valuable insights into theoretical issues, the need for culturally tailored mindfulness interventions for specific groups, and how such programs can be developed organically and collaboratively among researchers, participants, and community partners. The emerging field of mindfulness research within the context of diversity can advance further if research decisions are guided by established scientific principles.
This study explores veiling from an adaptive perspective, examining how the practice may serve women’s interests. The mate-guarding theory of veiling proposes that veiling functions as a cultural adaptation, reducing women’s attractiveness to prevent mate poaching and control female sexuality. Using data from the World Values Survey across ten Muslim-majority countries, this study explores the relationship between the importance of veiling and marital status as well as the number of children, hypothesizing that married women and those with a higher number of children are more in need of paternal investment. The results indicate that veiling is more important for married women and those with more children, suggesting that veiling functions as an adaptive strategy to conform to male mate preferences and thereby potentially secure paternal investment. Higher religiosity was also positively associated with veiling, while higher education levels were negatively associated. The study contributes to the understanding of veiling as a complex adaptive behavior shaped by both social and reproductive factors.
The practice of retrieval has been shown to be highly beneficial for memory retention, but it has seldom been compared with learning strategies other than repeated study. Here, we compared the benefits of retrieval practice (without feedback) with the benefits of two elaborative encoding tasks for word pair learning. Specifically, after studying series of randomly combined word pairs, participants performed an interactive-imagery (Experiments1–2) or sentence-generation task (Experiments3–5), retrieval practice, and a letter-counting or a rereading task. In Experiments1–4, the word pairs were shown after a 24-h interval for testing in its original form or with the second word replaced by the second word from another pair, and participants performed recognition (old/new) followed by associative memory tests (intact/rearranged). In Experiment5, memory was tested in a final cued-recall task administered shortly after initial learning. The interactive-imagery task was as beneficial as retrieval practice for recognition, but consistently more beneficial than retrieval for performance at the associative task. Sentence generation, on the other hand, produced greater performances than retrieval practice in recognition, associative memory, and cued-recall tests. These findings reveal that simple elaborative encoding tasks, such as imagining scenes or generating sentences, can be more beneficial for memory retention than retrieval practice without feedback.
Approximately 23% of adults in the USA do not engage in the recommended guidelines for physical activity, thus increasing their risk for developing various health-related diseases. Despite the importance of physical activity, previous research has primarily focused on increasing step count. A combination of interventions has been evaluated to increase physical activity such as self-monitoring, goal setting, feedback, and contingency management. However, research is needed to evaluate the effects of these interventions on increasing exercise. Thus, the current study aimed to increase the frequency of exercise sessions in three University students through the use of a treatment package consisting of choice, self-monitoring, goal setting, feedback, and contingency management plus a deposit contract. A nonconcurrent multiple baseline design across participants was used to assess the effectiveness of the treatment package. The results from this study demonstrated increases in minutes of aerobic activity per week during the intervention in comparison with baseline. The results add to the current body of the literature demonstrating that a treatment package consisting of choice, self-monitoring, goal setting, feedback, and contingency management plus a deposit contract may be successful in increasing aerobic physical activity. Future research may evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment package with other physical activity related behaviors and with various populations.
Psychological research on mindfulness has often focused on the effects of mindfulness training, such as clinical application, rather than on the meaning of mindfulness itself as taught in various spiritual, philosophical, and medical traditions. Mindfulness is often seen as a general training in attentional awareness. From a Buddhist perspective, this approach does not allow for the effective solution of deep-rooted problems arising from a deluded state of mind, which requires insight into the nature of mind. In order to apply the practice of mindfulness as a soteriological path, a precise understanding of the full range of functions of mindfulness and the judgmental mind is essential. To this end, this study explores the relevant definitions and levels of this practice in the context of Buddhist models of mind. This paper provides a profound analysis of early Indian Buddhist sources such as theFour Foundations of Mindfulnessand later Tibetan Buddhist presentations, in particular those of the Kagyu lineage, such as theDistinction between Consciousness and Wisdomby the 3rd Karmapa Rangjung Dorje (1284–1339). Buddhist epistemology and meditation instructions offer various mind maps and discuss the steps in the process of perception, based on the application of mindfulness, to overcome deluded states of mind and develop highest wisdom. The theoretical and practical findings are intended to be helpful in integrating traditional Buddhist models of mindfulness and the judging mind, including issues of health and happiness, with our modern understanding of cognitive processes as described in applied psychology.
A growing body of research suggests that the development of preschoolers’ self-control in intergenerational coparenting families is related to the parent-grandparent coparenting relationship. However, little is known about their bidirectional association and the mechanism. This study aimed at investigating the longitudinal interrelationship between mother-grandmother coparenting relationship and preschoolers’ self-control, and exploring the role of mother-child attachment. A total of 280 Chinese intergenerational coparenting families involved in this study with a one-year cross-lagged design. Mother-grandmother coparenting relationship, preschoolers’ self-control, and mother-child attachment were measured at each stage of the year (T1, T2, and T3). Results indicated that mother-grandmother coparenting relationship positively predicted mother-child attachment, and mother-child attachment positively predicted preschoolers’ self-control. Although we did not find the direct association between mother-grandmother coparenting relationship and preschoolers’ self-control, our findings indicated that mother-grandmother coparenting relationship was indirectly related to preschoolers’ self-control through mother-child attachment. Additionally, we found a longitudinally bidirectional relationship between mother-child attachment and preschoolers’ self-control. This study extends our understanding of the relationship between intergenerational coparenting relationship and child development and provides implications for improving the parenting quality in intergenerational coparenting families.
According to the schema model of self-control, repetitive self-control efforts falter due to the activation of a reduced vitality schema, resulting in increased motivation to conserve energy and reduced cognitive efforts. Building on these assumptions, we conducted two randomized controlled studies to examine the mental associations individuals form between subjective vitality, motivation to conserve energy, and motivation for cognitive effort. In both studies, the participants were presented with vignettes featuring fictitious characters described as either vital or non-vital. In Study 1 (N= 487), participants attributed higher motivation to conserve energy and lower cognitive motivation to the character described as having low subjective vitality. This finding indicates that participants seem to hold a vitality schema, in which perceived levels of vitality influence how cognitive resources are allocated. Furthermore, the motivation to conserve energy was found to partially mediate the relationship between subjective vitality and cognitive motivation, aligning with the schema model’s predictions. Study 2 (N= 449) successfully replicated the findings of Study 1 using different measures. Overall, the empirical evaluation of this sub-component of the schema model adds a crucial piece to the postulated causal chain, emphasizing the importance of schema-based approaches in self-control research and opening new perspectives for investigating the mechanisms of cognitive resource allocation. Our results provide a promising foundation for future studies to investigate the schema model at a behavioral level, as mental representations can be viewed as precursors that prompt individuals to translate their cognitive concepts into corresponding actions.
This article explores the integration of Jessica Benjamin’s concepts of ‘mutual recognition’ and ‘the third’ into child-parent psychotherapy (CPP), a relationship-based trauma-informed dyadic intervention model rooted in attachment theory. Despite the significance of caregiver-child relationships in trauma response, Benjamin’s work remains underutilized in the CPP literature. This article uses a case illustration to demonstrate how incorporating Benjamin’s concepts enriches CPP interventions that address the relational impact of trauma on young children. Three strategies are outlined to cultivate thirdness within CPP, drawing from clinical material: exploring trauma and complementarity, distinguishing play from reality, and working with the clinician’s subjectivity. The article illustrates how the utilization of Benjamin’s concepts can complement CPP and how emphasizing the intersubjective dynamic between parent and child, enhancing parental subjectivity, and prioritizing the repair of recognition breakdowns can support clinicians in advancing the therapeutic goals of CPP.
Despite abundant evidence that trait hope and trait gratitude predict higher well-being, there remained little research on whether these dispositions predict mental health among people living with financial challenges in real-life. Focusing on mothers (N= 462) in low-income families in Singapore, this study examined three questions. First, what hope-gratitude clusters would characterize the mother participants? Second, would the mothers’ trait hope and gratitude predict their depression and anxiety? Third, how might these dispositions moderate the relationships between economic hardship and depression and anxiety? Cluster analysis identified four naturally occurring clusters comprising high and low levels of both dispositions. Both dispositions negatively predicted depression and anxiety as expected. It was only among participants in clusters characterized by higher levels of trait hope - regardless of the level of trait gratitude - that the negative relationship between economic hardship and depression was non-significant. The relationships between economic hardships and both depression and anxiety were negative and significant in clusters with lower levels of trait hope regardless of trait gratitude. The results suggest that while trait hope and gratitude correlated negatively with depression and anxiety, trait gratitude does not appear to mitigate the negative relationships between economic hardship and both mental health outcomes and trait hope appears to reduce only the relationship between economic hardship and depression.
Existing literature primarily concentrates on the early stages of mobile device adoption, neglecting the investigation of how differentiated characteristics of mobile social media influence users’ perceived values and outcomes after acceptance. Consequently, the principal objective of this research is to empirically examine the associations among the fundamental characteristics of mobile social media (i.e., interactive characteristic, informational characteristic, and personalized characteristic), perceived values (i.e., functional value and experiential value), and final consequences, especially user loyalty and positive WOM. Using uses and gratifications theory as a foundation, the current research proposes a conceptual model that investigates the key factors that determine individuals’ loyalty and positive WOM on mobile social media by incorporating two perceived value variables. The research employed a quantitative methodology, which consisted of conducting a survey with a total of 826 participants in mainland China. The data was processed and analyzed using structural equation modeling 25.0 software and Amos 25.0 software. Obtained results of this research demonstrated that informational characteristic and personalized characteristic significantly influence mobile social media users’ perceived functional value and experiential value. This study also indicated that experiential value influence user loyalty and positive WOM. However, interactive characteristic exhibits insignificant impacts on functional value. This article provides an essential contribution to the existing body of literature on mobile applications by presenting a comprehensive theoretical underpinning and practical implications that illuminate the ongoing utilization of mobile devices.

ObjectivesRegulation of the heart by the brain is a vital function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and healthy ANS function has been linked to a wide range of well-being measures. Although there is evidence of mindfulness-meditation-related changes to brain functioning and heart functioning independently, few studies have examined the interaction between brain and heart functions in experienced meditators.MethodThis study compared measures of the brain–heart relationship between 37 experienced meditators and 35 non-meditators (healthy controls) using three different analysis methods: (1) the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP; thought to reflect neural sensitivity to interoceptive feedback); (2) the relationship between fronto-midline theta neural oscillations (fm-theta) and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) in electrocardiogram activity (an estimate of vagally mediated heart rate variability); and (3) the correlation between heart rate wavelet entropy and electroencephalographic wavelet entropy—a measure of signal complexity.ResultsThe HEP analysis indicated that meditators showed a more central-posterior distribution of neural activity time-locked to the heartbeat (p< 0.001, partialη2= 0.06) than controls. A significant positive relationship was also found between fm-theta and RMSSD in meditators (F(2,34) = 4.18,p= 0.02,R2= 0.20) but not controls. No significant relationship was found between EEG entropy and ECG entropy in either group.ConclusionsThe altered distribution of evoked neural activity, and the correlation between brain and heart biomarkers of vagal activity suggests greater neural regulation and perhaps greater sensitivity to interoceptive signals in experienced meditators.
Associations between arithmetic and reading skills suggest that these important abilities may rely, at least in part, on shared neurocognitive processes. It has been argued that retrieval of arithmetic facts may rely on phonological processing; however, very few studies have explored this association using neural indices and whether it manifests similarly in children and adults. Here we examined event related potentials (ERPs) as an indirect neural correlate of arithmetic fact retrieval, and whether variability in ERP modulation is associated with individual differences in phonological processing (verbal working memory, rate of access, and phonological awareness). Arithmetic processing was examined in two samples with different levels of arithmetic expertise: (1) young adults (n= 24;Mage= 21.8 years); and (2) children (n= 25;Mage= 11.2 years). Participants were presented with simple multiplication equations that were correct or incorrect. Significant modulations of the ERPs by correctness were found at posterior electrodes in both samples, however, in different components. In adults a modulation of the P300 was observed, while for children the N400 response was modulated. For both children and adults, the size of the ERP modulation in posterior electrodes was associated with individual differences in verbal working memory. These results highlight an important distinction between behavioral outcomes and their underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. Additionally, they provide insight into how arithmetic processing evolves over the course of development.
This study aimed to a) discuss the neurobiological mechanisms of depersonalization as arising from activation at the brainstem level and b) assess the effectiveness of deep brain reorienting psychotherapy (DBR) with a patient presenting with depersonalization-derealization disorder (DDD). In the first part of the paper, we discuss verbal abuse as a severe form of relational trauma and how it can be connected to depersonalization. It is argued that suddenly aversive experiences engage the brainstem locus coeruleus in widespread noradrenergic activation of the thalamus and cortex such that the balance of functioning within the cortex becomes disturbed and a subjective experience of chronic depersonalization results. In the second part, the single-case study aims to provide initial evidence of how the patient experienced and responded to DBR therapy. Pre- and post-treatment measures consisted of instruments to measure depersonalization, social anxiety symptoms and quality of life. After 43 DBR sessions, the participant's depersonalization and comorbid symptoms decreased significantly. Patients with DDD may benefit from DBR. Future research is required to address generalizability to a larger population.
Previous research has shown that parental psychological aggression may change with children’s age, and individual differences existed in the developmental trajectories of parental psychological aggression within different families. However, most studies on the heterogeneous psychological aggression trajectories have focused solely on mothers or combined mothers’ and fathers’ data, with few studies separately exploring the unique trajectories of fathers and mothers and their predictors and outcomes within Chinese societies. Therefore, this study investigated the heterogeneous trajectories of paternal and maternal psychological aggression from middle childhood to early adolescence and their associations with child- and family-level predictors and outcomes in China. A total of 1137 Chinese families with children in grades 1–3 (Mage= 7.17;SDage= 0.95 at Time 1; 52.35% boys, 47.65% girls) participated in assessments at five time points, using 1-year internals in between. Latent class growth models were used to estimate the heterogeneous trajectories of paternal and maternal psychological aggression from ages 7 to 11 years. Logistic regression analyses were used to understand the child- and family-level predictors of these trajectories, and analysis of covariance was used to examine the outcomes of these trajectories. The findings revealed that three trajectories of paternal psychological aggression were identified: low-persistent (88.95%), high-decreasing (7.93%), and high-increasing-decreasing (3.12%) trajectories. Four trajectories of maternal psychological aggression were identified: low-persistent (86.17%), high-decreasing (5.94%), high-increasing-decreasing (4.08%), and low-increasing (3.81%) trajectories. Lower marital satisfaction, more psychological aggression experiences during childhood, and being a parent of a boy were risk factors for both paternal and maternal trajectories, while higher negative affectivity in children was a risk factor of maternal but not paternal trajectories. In addition, the high-increasing-decreasing trajectory for both fathers and mothers as well as the low-increasing trajectory for mothers predicted children’s more internalizing and externalizing problems. These findings highlight the importance of considering heterogeneity in understanding the developmental patterns of parental psychological aggression, their predictors, and cumulative effects on child development.
Exploring the driving mechanism of college students’ innovative behavior plays an important role in accelerating the current cultivation of talents in colleges and social development. Based on the results of in-depth qualitative interviews with 22 Chinese college students, this study adopts the procedural grounded coding method to summarize the pyramid model of college students’ innovative behavior in the three dimensions of innovative motivation, innovative cognition, and innovative behavior, and found that the factors driving college students’ innovative behavior are mainly autonomy and material factors, with motivational and mandatory factors supplementing them, while college students’ innovative behavior satisfy the needs for autonomy, competence, and belongingness. The results broaden the current theoretical research related to college students’ innovation and are of great practical significance in guiding the cultivation of innovative talents in colleges and universities.
In today’s competitive corporate climate, strategic human resource management (SHRM) requires a thorough grasp of employee perceptions of human resource practices (EPHRP) since EPHRP can significantly impact individual and organizational outcomes. However, research challenges remain in the operationalization and theorization of EPHRP, especially regarding the employment of different types of EPHRP measures, which prevents the understanding of EPHRP and the effectiveness of SHRM. Therefore, this study aims to review up-to-date EPHRP-related studies and understand how it has been operationalized and theorized in quantitative research. The current review employed Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Protocol 2020 to find English-written studies published before May 2024 that have investigated EPHRP. One hundred ten studies were synthesized and analyzed regarding the general characteristics of EPHRP research, the operationalization and theorization of the EPHRP construct. The results demonstrate an increasing interest and diversified approaches in studying EPHRP. However, results also reveal the ambiguity in EPHRP conceptualization, concerns in its operationalization and applications, as well as the lack of sufficient investigation of descriptive EPHRP and the predictors of EPHRP. Focusing on the operationalization and theorization of EPHRP, the study conducted a comprehensive review and provided insights into the issues of EPHRP measurement. Such investigations advance the understanding of EPHRP, offering valuable implications for both SHRM researchers and practitioners.
Despite the liberation and progressions of women all around the world in the twenty-first century, women keep on being under-addressed in administration positions. Women in independent India have changed all through history, but the post-industrial revolution and its positive effects were only made obvious to them in the last 35 years. Despite the ratio of women in India’s police forces rising, they still make up slightly more than 7% of the department’s all-around workforce. The job of women as chiefs included even those areas of work, which were prior viewed as unequivocally man’s spaces like the police association. The target of the review was to recognize the obstacles and hindrances common all around the world at variable degrees for female police and furthermore talk about the change in perspective in the impression of the overall population toward women as police. Current data reveal that most women in the police are concentrated in the lower ranks reflecting the dearth of females in key operational positions. The strategy of the review was a subjective evaluation of various examinations led in a few nations. The job of women staff in the police is very important. Though generally it was very limited but now with time, it has expanded and gained appreciation. The government additionally perceived the job that women police personnel played. The reason for this reality is that women police are proficient. For all kinds of people, women police personnel is vital. Men police can see just men’s wrongdoing; however, women can see all people both (crime) legally and typically both. At the point when women take part in law enforcement, at all levels and in all jobs, policing is more receptive to, and intelligent of, the local area it serves. The significant cooperation of women in policing activity viability improves local area trust and diminishes corruption.
Optimism and resilience may differ in their ability to predict various types of student stress, but they have yet to be directly compared within the U.S. higher education landscape. In this study, we directly compared the two traits to see which one would be a stronger predictor of academic stress. First-year college students (N= 355) completed an online study that measured their perceived academic stress, dispositional optimism, and dispositional resilience. Bivariate correlations showed that resilience and optimism were both negatively correlated with all four types of academic stress. Multiple regression showed that resilience was a stronger predictor than optimism for stress related to academic self-perceptions, whereas optimism was a better predictor than resilience for stress related to pressure to perform and time restraints, even when controlling for demographic and personality factors. These findings increase knowledge about the relationships between academic stress, resilience, and optimism and may be informative for future intervention research.
Artificial selection yielded four replicate high runner (HR) lines of mice that reached apparent selection limits (~ threefold increase in wheel revolutions per day vs. four control lines), despite maintenance of additive genetic variance. After 68 generations, we used animal models to test for changes in additive-genetic variances and covariance of the two measured components (average speed and duration) of running distance. We also attempted to break the selection limit by crossing two HR lines, then continuing directional selection on this hybrid line and on the two parental lines for nine generations. The genetic correlation between speed and duration was positive in the base population, but evolved to be negative in the two parental HR lines. Although heritability for both speed and duration (but not distance) increased in the hybrid line, their genetic correlation remained negative. Hybrid F1mice from generation 68 parents showed heterosis for running distance, which was lost in subsequent generations, and the hybrid line did not exceed the limit. Both male and female hybrids ran faster than parental lines for most generations, but running duration was intermediate or reduced, reflecting their negative genetic correlation. The evolved genetic trade-off between speed and duration may explain the inability for the hybrid line to break the selection limit for distance run, despite renewed additive genetic variance for at least one of its component traits.
In the era of the sharing economy, the issue of employee well-being is often overlooked, although it is a key measure of job satisfaction and organizational commitment. The human resource management of the platform is facing major changes in the external environment and internal structure, and the sharing employee management practices (SEMPs) arise at the historic moment. This study aims to explore the mediating role of organizational commitment and moderating role of job autonomy in the association between each dimension of SEMPs, that is platform support (SEMP1), platform incentive (SEMP2), platform constraint (SEMP3) on work well-being (WWB) in the context of platform organization. This study employed quantitative methods, focusing on designated drivers as the participants of the survey, and collected data from 218 questionnaires. The results show that, the three dimensions of SEMPs can positively affect the WWB of sharing employees through organizational commitment. Job autonomy actively moderates the relationship between platform support/ platform incentive and organizational commitment, and positively moderates the mediating role of organizational commitment in the relationship between platform support/ platform incentive and the WWB of sharing employees. These findings can help to expand the theoretical research related to human resource management in the context of the sharing economy, at the same time, it also provides practical guidance for platform enterprises to improve the WWB of sharing employees by optimizing management strategies.
BackgroundPrevious studies showed that lay people see modernization as a threat to social fabric because it will make people less warm and moral. The purpose of this paper is to describe lay people’s understanding of the effects of different types of modernization. Specifically, we checked how social, economic, technological and conventional development are expected to influence communion, agency and well-being in the future society.MethodsWe conducted three cross-sectional studies using online surveys. Prolific participant pool users over 18 years of age that held Canadian citizenship and resided in Canada were eligible to take part in the study in exchange for financial compensation. T-tests and linear regression analyses were conducted using SPSS statistical package.ResultsParticipants expected that people in future society will have lower well-being than today. Technological modernization was expected to decrease communion and well-being but increase agency in the future, while social modernization was expected to strengthen societal communion, agency and well-being.ConclusionLay people believe that different types of modernization will have different effects on society. Whereas technological progress is viewed ambivalently, social development is seen as uniformly positive for well-being of society. In order to counter pessimism about the future, policy makers should focus on social development while striving to mitigate negative social aspects of technological advancements.
Parents and children often engage in joint play—a domain where mothers and fathers are thought to exhibit disparate behaviors and impact child development via distinct mechanisms. However, little is known about the neural substrates of mother-child and father-child play. In this fMRI study, we sampled the brain activation of parents of preschoolers (N= 88) during a novel event-related adaptation of the virtual ball-tossing game “Cyberball.” Mothers (N= 40) and fathers (N= 48) played “Cyberball” ostensibly with their own and an unrelated child, who consecutively included, excluded, and reincluded parents. We found that overall, exclusion yielded comparable neural activations in mothers and fathers associated with mentalizing, saliency, and emotion processing. We also observed a parent gender effect in several brain areas. While mothers exhibited increased reward- and attention-related activity during inclusion, fathers displayed increased mentalizing-related activity during exclusion. Furthermore, we tested parents’ response to reinclusion, which revealed a selective decrease in reward-related activity. Finally, exploratory analyses showed that parental involvement was positively correlated with parental brain activity within attention- and mentalizing-related areas during inclusion, as opposed to other game phases, and that an anxious parenting style was associated with increased neural sensitivity for game events involving their own child. Overall, our study elucidates the common and distinct neural networks that mothers and fathers engage during play interactions with their children, supporting theories that postulate only a partial differentiation of paternal and maternal parenting systems.
Children exposed to family violence (i.e. child abuse and neglect and intimate partner violence) are often emotionally insecure in their relationship with their parents, and develop psychosocial problems. Emotional insecurity increases the likelihood of psychosocial problems, and may affect adjustment in other contexts (e.g., school). Among children exposed to family violence, emotional insecurity may indirectly affect psychosocial problems through well-being at school (school connectedness, well-being with teachers, and well-being with classmates), or well-being at school may moderate the association between emotional insecurity and psychosocial problems. Participants were 317 Dutch children aged 8–17 years (53.3% girls, mean age 12.7 years) and their parents, recruited through child protection services. Participants completed questionnaires on family violence, emotional insecurity, well-being at school, and psychosocial problems between June 2021 and August 2022. Analyses were conducted using Structural Equation Modeling. More emotional insecurity and less well-being at school were both related to more psychosocial problems, but emotional insecurity was not related to well-being at school. Emotional insecurity did not indirectly affect psychosocial problems through well-being at school (β = 0.01,p= .76) nor did well-being at school moderate (β = − .08,p= .14) the association between emotional insecurity and psychosocial problems in children exposed to family violence. This suggests that emotional insecurity and well-being at school each contribute independently to psychosocial problems. A longitudinal study should be conducted to fully understand how these aspects develop and relate in children exposed to family violence. Clinical support may focus on children’s emotional insecurity and well-being at school, in addition to reducing the violence.
It is hypothesized that cognitions influence the development of affective disorders. Depression and anxiety are prevalent in both adults and youth. The Children’s Automatic Thoughts Scale (CATS) assesses internalizing and externalizing negative automatic thoughts in children and adolescents. This study examined the psychometric properties– including factor structure, internal consistency and convergent validity– of the Slovenian version of CATS in a normative school sample (N= 754) of Slovenian adolescents aged 10 to 18. Additionally, the short-term stability of negative automatic thoughts over a three-month period was assessed in a subsample of 117 participants. Confirmatory factor analysis showed the best fit for the bifactor model, with one general and four specific factors (CFI = 0.963, TLI = 0.958, RMSEA = 0.045). Cronbach’s α and McDonald’s ω ranged from 0.81 to 0.96 for the total scale and subscales. The total score and subscales correlated significantly with the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale. The Slovenian version of CATS shows good psychometric properties in the school sample.
Narcissism is a well-established personality trait characterized by a tripartite structure that includes privilege/antagonism as the central feature, grandiosity/agentic extraversion, and vulnerability/neuroticism as phenotypic features. The relationship between narcissism and prosocial behavior (PsB) has been inconsistent in previous studies. To clarify the relationship between narcissism and PsB, we conducted a meta-analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that met the appropriate inclusion criteria. Given the distinct connotations and structures of the two primary types of narcissism: grandiose narcissism (GN) and vulnerable narcissism (VN), we performed separate meta-analyses for each, drawing from the relevant literature on PsB. For the analysis of VN-PsB, we included a total of 19 studies, 32 effect sizes, and a sample size of 6,536 individuals. The results indicated no significant negative correlation between PsB and VN (r= -0.08, 95% CI [-0.20, 0.05]). And the relationship between VN and PsB was moderated by methods of measuring PsB. In the analysis of GN-PsB, we included 59 studies, 198 effect sizes, and a sample size of 42,919 individuals. The results revealed a significant positive correlation between PsB and GN (r= 0.07, 95% CI [0.02, 0.12]). This positive association between GN and PsB remains robust across different ages, methods of measuring PsB, and cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, the relationship between GN and PsB was moderated by the types of GN; communal narcissism exhibited a significant positive correlation with PsB, and the strength of this correlation was notably greater than that between agentic narcissism and PsB.
BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic, declared by the World Health Organization in early 2020, rapidly escalated from a global health crisis to a significant public health issue worldwide. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive global overview of suicidal behavior and associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsAdhering to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, literature searches were conducted across five databases: Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Academic Search Complete. The review encompassed studies published from January 1, 2019, to November 29, 2023. A total of 286 studies met the inclusion criteria, offering a broad perspective on suicidal behaviors during the pandemic. The studies underwent quality assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal for Checklist for Prevalence Studies Scale (CACPSS).ResultsThe highest rates of suicidal behavior were observed in the Americas, Europe, and the Western Pacific Region, with China and the United States reporting significant cases. Key risk factors included demographic characteristics, mental health conditions, and social support factors. Suicidal ideation prevalence rates ranged significantly, with the highest in some regions exceeding 50%. Suicide attempts and completed suicides also showed considerable variation across different countries and regions.ConclusionThe findings emphasize the need for targeted mental health interventions and policies to reduce suicide risk, highlighting the multifaceted nature of suicidal behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comprehensive, multidisciplinary approaches are necessary to address this pressing concern, and understanding the interplay among diverse risk factors is crucial for developing effective prevention and intervention strategies.
The article, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie (ZPS), reflects upon the backstage thinking during a therapist process. If one-to-one psychodrama psychotherapy can be seen as a kind of performanceà deux,what happens in the backstage domain of therapist awareness? How do we balance being and doing in the therapy room, and what informs the choice and timing of action methods offered? Examples from practice illustrate key issues and highlight the less visible domain of therapist process.
BackgroundThe current study attempted to replicate the original findings regarding the effects of power posing on testosterone and cortisol levels, risk-taking behavior, and perceived power. We further extended the investigation by testing the effect of power posing on estradiol and progesterone levels.MethodsA sample of 92 young adults (30 males; 32 females taking oral contraceptives; and 30 females not taking oral contraceptives who were in their midluteal phase) were randomly assigned to high-power-pose or low-power-pose conditions and asked about their feelings of power. They completed a risk-taking task, and their neuroendocrine levels were measured both at baseline and following the power manipulation.ResultsPower posing was not found to replicate the original results regarding effects on testosterone levels or feelings of power; however, our findings partially supported the original results regarding effects on cortisol levels and risk-taking. Among high-power posers, a decrease in cortisol levels was associated with risk tolerance. Power posing was not found to influence progesterone levels. However, among females taking oral contraceptives, high-power posing increased estradiol levels.ConclusionsThese preliminary findings suggest that estradiol is influenced by short-term exposure to social cues under specific hormonal profiles.
BackgroundEating disorders (EDs) are increasingly prevalent in men, but men remain underrepresented across many ED-specific treatment settings. Based on the idea that persistent stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination, i.e., stigma against men with EDs, could impede help-seeking behaviors, the present study investigated whether stigma-related perceptions in men are associated with reduced help-seeking intentions for a broad range of disordered eating symptoms.MethodsN= 132 adult men participated in a cross-sectional online survey and completed questionnaires on ED psychopathology, muscle dysmorphia, orthorexic eating, stigma-related perceptions of EDs in men, and help-seeking intentions.ResultsModerator analyses showed that higher stigma-related perceptions were associated with reduced help-seeking intentions in response to increased ED symptom severity. However, this was only the case for traditionally “feminized” ED symptoms (related to thin-body ideals), but not for help-seeking with regard to muscularity-oriented, orthorexic, or avoidant/restrictive disordered eating.ConclusionsStigma may reduce help-seeking intentions with regard to “feminized” ED symptoms. The present findings suggest that perceptions of EDs as “women’s diseases” were associated with reduced help-seeking in men. Stigma towards men with EDs could thus be a possible barrier to help-seeking in men, highlighting the relevance of stigma-reducing interventions in clinical and community settings.
From shopping to financial investment and life planning, intertemporal choice is everywhere in daily life. The psychological power theory based on the concept of luck has explored the influence of luck perception on an individual’s intertemporal choice. Study results show that compared to individuals feeling unlucky, Individuals feel lucky and choose larger & later option. Luck perception can affect the intertemporal choice through the working mechanism of positive illusion. Compared with individuals who perceive unlucky, individuals who perceive lucky will develop a positive illusion, with which they are more willing to choose larger & later option. In addition, the uncertainty tolerance of individuals can moderate the influence of luck perception on intertemporal choice. For individual with a low tolerance for uncertainty, the perception of luck will make them inclined to choose larger & later option, while the perception of unluck will make them inclined to choose smaller & sooner option. However, individuals with a high tolerance for uncertainty exhibit a weakened preference effect of luck perception on intertemporal choice.
The study investigates the mediating role of mindfulness in the relation between marriage role expectations, forgiveness and marital adjustment in a sample of 461 people that are at least 1 year married and leave in Turkey (67.5% female; age range: 18–50).Personal Information Formprepared by the researcher,Marriage Role Expectations Inventory (MREI),Forgiveness Scale,Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS-R)and The Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) were used for data collection. Descriptive statistics methods, Pearson correlation analysis, Independent Sample T-Test and Hayes Process mediation analysis were used for analysis. The findings show that equalitarian expectations are positively related to marital adjustment and mindfulness. Traditional expectations were found have a negative significant relationship with mindfulness. There is a significant positive relationship between forgiveness and marital adjustment. Traditional expectations had a positive relationship only with the unresponsiveness to internal experiences. Mindfulness mediates the relation between equalitarian expectations and marital adjustment in a positive direction. There are no studies on these variables in the literature. With the study, the need for a study examining the relations between these three variables was tried to be eliminated. This research fills a gap in the literature by providing an in-depth look at the role of mindfulness in marital adjustment. It reveals the importance of mindfulness and marriage role expectations. Mindfulness-based targeted interventions are necessary to enhance marital adjustment in married couples. By understanding individuals’ levels of mindfulness and marital role expectations, policymakers can develop actionable solutions to increase couples’ levels of mindfulness and improve marital adjustment.

Firing across populations of neurons in many regions of the mammalian brain maintains a temporal memory, a neural timeline of the recent past. Behavioral results demonstrate that people can both remember the past and anticipate the future over an analogous internal timeline. This paper presents a mathematical framework for building this timeline of the future. We assume that the input to the system is a time series of symbols—sparse tokenized representations of the present—in continuous time. The goal is to record pairwise temporal relationships between symbols over a wide range of time scales. We assume that the brain has access to a temporal memory in the form of the real Laplace transform. Hebbian associations with a diversity of synaptic time scales are formed between the past timeline and the present symbol. The associative memory stores the convolution between the past and the present. Knowing the temporal relationship between the past and the present allows one to infer relationships between the present and the future. With appropriate normalization, this Hebbian associative matrix can store a Laplace successor representation and a Laplace predecessor representation from which measures of temporal contingency can be evaluated. The diversity of synaptic time constants allows for the learning of non-stationary statistics as well as joint statistics between triplets of symbols. This framework synthesizes a number of recent neuroscientific findings including results from dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic forebrain.
Drawing on Team Regulation Theory, we discuss how and when inclusive leadership impacts team innovation. Data were collected from 545 full-time employees in 119 teams using a 4-phase time-lag method. Path analysis and Bootstrapping simulation analyses were used to test the hypotheses. The results showed that inclusive leadership positively influenced team innovation, and team diversity climate and team reflexivity play a chain mediating role in the relationship between the two. Additionally, team career calling moderated the relationship between team diversity climate and team reflexivity, and the positive relationship between the two was stronger when team career calling was higher. These findings and their implications for theory and practice are discussed.
Word identification accuracy is modulated by many factors including linguistic characteristics of words (frequent vs. infrequent), listening environment (noisy vs. quiet), and listener-related differences (older vs. younger). Nearly, all studies investigating these factors use high-familiarity words and noise signals that are either energetic maskers (e.g., white noise) or informational maskers composed of competing talkers (e.g., multitalker babble). Here, we expand on these findings by examining younger and older listeners’ speech-in-noise perception for words varying in both frequency and familiarity within a simulated hospital noise that has important non-speech information. The method was inspired by the real-world challenges aging patients can face in understanding less familiar medical terminology used by healthcare professionals in noisy hospital environments. Word familiarity data from older and young adults were collected for 800 medically related terms. Familiarity ratings were highly correlated between the two age groups. Older adults’ transcription accuracy for sentences with medical terminology that vary in their familiarity and frequency was assessed across four listening conditions: hospital noise, speech-shaped noise, amplitude-modulated speech-shaped noise, and quiet. Listeners were less accurate in noise conditions than in a quiet condition and were more impacted by hospital noise than either speech-shaped noise. Sentences with low-familiarity and low-frequency medical words combined with hospital noise were particularly detrimental for older adults compared to younger adults. The results impact our theoretical understanding of speech perception in noise and highlight real-world consequences of older adults’ difficulties with speech-in-noise and specifically noise containing competing, non-speech information.
The spatial numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect demonstrates that people respond faster to small numbers with their left hand and faster to large numbers with their right hand. The size congruity effect (SCE) refers to the fact that congruent trials between numerical values and physical sizes are faster than incongruent trials. Previous studies have found that the SNARC effect and SCE are independent when magnitudes or sizes are processed explicitly. This study aimed to explore whether number, size, and space are common and distinct mechanisms using an implicit parity judgment task. The results showed that the SNARC effect, SCE, and SNARC-like effect all co-existed. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between the SNARC effect and SCE, in which the SNARC effect in the SCE-congruent condition was larger than in the SCE-incongruent condition, whereas SCE merely emerged in the SNARC-compatible trials. However, participants responded to small numbers in large size faster than to large numbers in small size with the left hand in SCE-incongruent trials, which reflected that number-space mapping (SNARC effect) was stronger than size-space mapping (SNARC-like effect). These findings provide new evidence for A Theory of Magnitude (ATOM), which suggests that number, size, and space are associated with a common generalized magnitude system through distinct mechanisms.
The refugee experience is a known risk factor for psychological stress, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and somatic pain. However, the prevalence and comorbidity of these health outcomes in asylum seekers is not elucidated. Here we performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study in which the forensic medical evaluations of 453 globally representative US asylum seekers were analyzed. Outcomes included the prevalence of symptoms of psychological stress, CVD, somatic pain and their comorbidity. Symptoms of psychological stress, CVD and somatic pain were documented in 94%, 47% and 50% of participants, respectively; 46% reported both CVD and stress symptoms, and 31% reported all three. Palpitations, presyncope/syncope, stroke symptoms and chest pain were reported in 33%, 25%, 20% and 16% of individuals with CVD symptoms, respectively. Furthermore, both stress symptoms and pain symptoms were each strongly predictive of comorbid CVD symptoms. These findings indicate that asylum seekers experience a high burden of comorbid and interrelated psychological stress, CVD and somatic pain.
Analog behavior observations are an important component of an evidence-based approach to assessing parent–child interactions. One threat to the external validity of these observations is reactivity and its purported influence on parent and child behaviors. The effects of reactivity on caregiver-child observations are relatively unknown, and to date, there are no known published attempts to document reactivity using a parent report measure. We examined the psychometrics of the Observation Reactivity Questionnaire (ORQ), a 29-item parent report measure of reactivity, operationalized here as a composite including parent report for whether a clinic-based observation represents home behavior (perceived unrepresentativeness), whether a clinic-based observation represents typical parent and child behavior (perceived unrepresentative parent and child behavior), perceived difficulty of the observation task, and perceived discomfort with the observation task. A community sample of 55 parent–child dyads (parents aged 23–56, children aged 2–10) completed a manualized, analog behavior observation prior to completing the ORQ. We investigated psychometric properties of the ORQ quantitative items and compiled qualitative data wherein parents described their reasoning for their responses. Internal consistency of the ORQ was adequate, although discriminative validity evidence was mixed. On average, parents were significantly more likely to report higher levels of reactivity in themselves compared to their children. We concluded that the ORQ shows promise as a new measure of reactivity during observations of parent–child interactions. By quantifying and accounting for reactivity during analog behavior observations, researchers and clinicians can decrease external validity threat concerns in the contexts of research and parent training interventions.
Although there is evidence that cognitive training enhances logical reasoning among the elderly, it remains unclear whether cognitive leisure activities (LA), which are inherently enjoyable and more accessible to older adults than cognitive training, can also improve their reasoning performance. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of cognitive LA on reasoning performance among the elderly and further explored the potential mechanism underlying this relationship. 107 elder participants from the community university for the elderly were randomized into two intervention groups (mahjong groupN= 34, chess groupsN= 33) and the control group (N= 40). Subjects in the intervention groups received activity sessions three times a week for 6 weeks, while those in the control group received regular physical and mental health care sessions. Need for cognition (NFC) was evaluated using the NFC scale before the study and then after intervention administration. Additionally, all participants were tasked to completing a syllogistic reasoning task after the intervention to evaluating their reasoning performances. Results showed that the intervention groups performed better than the control group in the syllogistic reasoning task. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the scores of NFC between the intervention groups and control group in the pretest, while the scores of NFC of the intervention groups were significantly higher than those of the control group in the posttest. Mediation analysis revealed that NFC mediated the effect of cognitive LA on reasoning performances among the elderly. We concluded that participating in cognitive LA represent a potential avenue for enhancing reasoning performances among older adults by boosting their cognitive motivation.
People with branched attractions may experience sexual and romantic attractions to different genders; for example, they may be sexually attracted to one gender and romantically attracted to another gender. Because branched attractions may violate folk theories about sexuality, we expected individuals with these attractions to face unique stereotypes. Across three preregistered experiments (totalN= 1041), and using predominantly White, non-Latiné, and straight samples, we asked if White (Studies 1 and 2) and East Asian (Study 3) targets with branched attractions are seen as: (1) confused, dishonest, and non-monogamous (bi stereotypes), (2) uncertain about and in denial of their sexuality (instability stereotypes), and (3) desired as sexual objects (fetishized), compared to targets with aligned (same-gender, other-gender, bisexual) attractions. We also assessed warmth toward targets, and explored perceivers’ need for cognition as a moderator. As expected, White and East Asian women and men with branched attractions faced heightened bi and instability stereotypes, whereas findings with warmth, fetishization, and need for cognition were mixed. Discussion considers the implications of these findings for sexually and racially minoritized individuals.
Since the learning and developmental processes of adults have rarely been studied in the context of coparenting, this study seeks to deepen our understanding of early coparenting development by examining longitudinal qualitative multimethod data. The data of Finnish 30 opposite-sex two-parent families were collected during three different phases: the third trimester of pregnancy with individual interviews, 4–6 months postnatal by a survey and diary method, and 18 months postnatal through individual interviews. The longitudinal analysis combined initial cross-sectional thematic analysis and longitudinal analysis. The results showed that early coparenting develops among new parental couples through the merging of simultaneous individual and interrelational processes. Early coparenting involves several adult learning processes and turning points. Four developmental pathways illustrating the couples’ journeys were identified: (a) equal and supportive coparenting, (b) from differential adaptation to smooth coparenting, (c) from the mother’s primacy to a communicating team, and (d) a challenging coparenting rollercoaster. These pathways vary from a smooth and linear growth curve to a variable and tense process that takes time and patience. In all, the results indicate that first-time parents (either as couples or partners) can be at different points in adapting to a new life stage and growing into parenthood, which may complicate the development of coparenting.
This research investigates how despotic leadership influences follower creativity within the hospitality context. Grounded in social exchange theory (SET), the research delves into the mediating role of psychological safety in the link between despotic leadership and follower creativity. Additionally, it explores how power distance moderates this relationship, potentially alleviating the adverse implications of despotic leadership. By analyzing data collected from 447 employees in China, our findings reveal that despotic leadership behaviors diminish follower creativity. The results emphasize the crucial role of psychological safety as a mediating factor in this relationship. Furthermore, the study uses moderated path analysis to reveal that high power distance intensifies the negative impact of despotic leadership on psychological safety, further reducing employees’ creativity. The research concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for both theoretical and practical applications.
Leadership research has been developed to apply to different context but never explored service episodes and a customer’s leading power. In this study, a new concept, customer leadership, was developed to capture customers' behavioral impact on service encounters through interactions with service providers. We collected first-hand qualitative data in the form of field notes by observing 377 service encounters at a hair salon in Japan, and we coded 30 items of leadership-related customer behavior. The qualitative study was followed by a questionnaire survey of 773 hair salon customers, and the purpose was to build a validated new construct supported by the survey data. Results showed that the construct of customer leadership consists of three factors, delegation, guidance, and relationship-building, and 11 items. Additionally, our hypothesis on the significant effects of customer leadership on service quality and customer satisfaction was partly supported. Both studies jointly contribute to bridging the literature on leadership with service marketing, providing a new leadership construct and specific perspective of applying leadership theories to service studies. The application of this construct measure can also serve as a management tool for customer relationships.
In this article, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziomterie (ZPS), it will be underlined that one of the most effective roles is that of a Present and Embodied Coach. Explaining role theory as ‘putting on the most appropriate clothes to suit the occasion’ has emerged as a simple way to explain that clients not only have agency around the roles they play in their lives, they also can have greater control over encounters with others as consciousness of their own state develops. Deploying sociodramatic tools such as the Cultural Atom and Role Reversal as well as presence techniques from the world of coaching, this paper shares case studies and practical tips that serve both coach and client.
In this article, published in the Zeitschrift für Psychodrama und Soziometrie (ZPS), we will review and discuss the different one-to-one psychodrama methods that we teach at the Anne Ancelin Schutzenberger International School of Psychogenealogy and Transgenerational Therapy. It covers the use of the empty chair, the two chairs, internal psychodrama, psychodrama with objects, the minimalist bipersonal psychodrama and the ancestral psychodrama, together with some form of bilateral stimulation of the body.
Understanding the neurocognitive mechanisms that govern the coordination of habitual and goal-directed behaviors is important, because impaired coordination will cause various behavioral disorders. However, inducing habitual responses in human beings through repetitive stimuli-response training in a laboratory setting is a challenge. Well-trained sports athletes, who have automatic perception–action associations toward expertise-related stimuli, provide a natural sample to address this critical knowledge gap. We recorded electroencephalograms (EEG) of well-trained sports athletes while they performed a Simon task with expertise-related stimuli. By manipulating the congruency between the location of expertise-related stimuli and the response hand, we dissociated automatic habitual response and goal-directed inhibition control. We observed a stronger behavioral congruency effect on expertise-related stimuli than neutral stimuli in sports athletes but not healthy controls. Furthermore, sports athletes exhibited larger response-locked lateralized readiness potentials and stronger frontocentral beta band (15–25 Hz) activity in the congruent condition than the incongruent condition, which indicate an enhanced response tendency toward expertise-related stimuli. In contrast, prominent mid-frontal theta (3–7 Hz) activity observed in the incongruent condition signaled the involvement of response inhibition. Additionally, lateralized readiness potentials amplitude and theta power showed significant correlation with performance efficiency. Taken together, these results suggest that sports athletes exhibit an enhanced coordination for expertise-related stimuli, involving automatic response preparation and proficient response inhibition through extensive training.
Stroop-like interference effects are smaller in blocks of mostly incongruent (MI) trials than in blocks of mostly congruent (MC) trials. It is unclear, though, how control processes trigger this list-wide proportion congruency effect (LWPCE). The attentional shift account posits that a memory of experiencing conflict more frequently in MI blocks than in MC blocks leads control processes to shift attention toward the target in MI blocks. The response modulation account posits that a memory of block-wide congruency statistics (e.g., mostly incongruent) leads control processes to form expectations about upcoming trial congruency independent of conflict and modulate distractor-related response activation to prepare an expected congruent response (in MC blocks) or incongruent response (in MI blocks) to the target. This modulation occurs, however, only if the system translates the distractor into a response before the target. We conducted two experiments with the prime-probe task (N= 120) to investigate the response modulation account’s prediction that giving the distractor a “head start” in stimulus–response translation increases the LWPCE independent of conflict. Confirming this prediction, the LWPCE was larger when the distractor appeared before – versus simultaneously with – the target, even though the overall congruency (i.e., conflict) effect was equivalent in these conditions (Experiment 1) or smaller when the distractor appeared before the target (Experiment 2). We also observed a negative congruency effect in the MI blocks of Experiment 2, which is inconsistent with a shift of attention toward the target. We conclude that a modulation of response activation contributes to the LWPCE.
Iron deficiency (ID) is the most prevalent nutrient deficiency in the world, with a growing literature documenting the negative effects of ID on perception, attention, and memory. Animal models of ID suggest that dysregulation of dopamine is responsible for the deficits in memory. However, evidence that ID affects dopamine in humans is extremely limited. We report the results of a study involving college-aged women with and without ID learning two different category structures – a rule-based and an information-integration structure – selected based on the putative differential role of dopamine in learning these two structures. ID non-anemic (IDNA) and iron-sufficient (IS) women completed 1200 learning trials for each structure. EEG was collected to assess the effects of ID on features affected by dopaminergic state: error-related negativity (ERN) and positivity (Pe), feedback-related negativity (FRN), and task-related blink rate. In addition, we examined the EEG data for dynamics distinguishing IDNA from IS women, including a measure of neural efficiency. Both groups of women were able to learn both structures. However, IDNA women were initially slower and less accurate than IS women, specifically for the rule-based structure. There were large and persistent group differences in brain dynamics and neural efficiency measures. The results are discussed with respect to the selective impact of ID on initial rule-based learning and the persistent effect of ID on dopamine signaling and energetic efficiency.
The social media platform Instagram popularises a “healthy eating” movement, but some of its trends may be harmful. We assessed the risk of viewing #cleaneating and #whatieatinaday content on eating behaviours using adapted items from a short version of the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and body satisfaction using the Body Image States Scale (BISS). A total of 403 women aged 18–78 years recruited through snowball and opportunity sampling were randomised into three study groups: #cleaneating (n= 140), #whatieatinaday (n= 141) and #nature (n= 122) as control. Participants completed online EDE-Q (lower score indicated more disordered eating behaviour) and BISS scales before and after viewing the content of their assigned hashtag. Post-exposure EDE-Q or BISS scores below pre-exposure (baseline) scores were defined as deficit scores. Logistic regression, adjusted for age and BMI, and presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), was used to compare deficit scores between study groups. The overall baseline mean (SD) age was 26.7 years (11.7), BMI 23.3 kg/m2(3.6), EDE-Q 2.7 (1.0) and BISS scores 5.6 (0.8), which were similar between study groups. Compared to control (#nature), EDE-Q scores were reduced after exposure to #cleaneating and #whatieatinaday (ANOVA:P< 0.001), and there was an increased risk for having deficit EDE-Q scores after exposure to #cleaneating: OR = 2.86 (95% CI = 1.68–4.90), and to #whatieatinaday: OR = 2.58 (95% CI = 1.52–4.39). The corresponding ORs were higher in younger age (18–21 years) but similar in different BMI categories. Exposure to #cleaneating or #whatieatinaday did not change BISS scores. A single exposure to #cleaneating and #whatieatinaday content on Instagram may encourage disordered eating behaviours, especially in younger women. Future research should examine the effects of this type of diet advice media on all genders, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic, educational and marital status, as well as LGBTQ + identity, over the longer term and after exposure to video-based content.
BackgroundEven though robust evidence suggests the high prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) in China, EDs in China are characterized by low diagnosis rates, delayed treatment-seeking, and ineffective treatments. Given that listening to patients’ perspectives and lived experiences is crucial to improving our understanding of EDs in the Chinese context, an investigation of the perceived causes of EDs in Chinese individuals with EDs represents a key step in improving the prevention and treatment of EDs in China.AimsTo explore the perceived causes of EDs based on data from a sample of Chinese social media users with self-reported EDs, with a particular focus on the Zhihu platform.MethodsWe extracted and analyzed data through content analysis. Eight specific causes that could be classified into two groups were coded, including individual factors (e.g., “body image and eating”) and sociocultural factors (e.g., “media and cultural ideals”).ResultsA total of 2079 entries regarding self-reported EDs were retained for content analysis (14.7% were anorexia nervosa, 37.6% were bulimia nervosa, and 47.7% were binge-eating disorder). More than 90% of users with self-reported EDs claimed causes belonging to individual factors, while 35–51% of users claimed sociocultural factors. “Body image and eating” (68–87%) and “psychological and emotional problems” (65–67%) were the most commonly claimed specific causes, while “traumatic life events” (13–14%), “genetics and biology” (7–13%), and “sports and health” (9–12%) were the least claimed. Chi-square independent tests showed that users with different self-reported EDs disproportionately claimed certain causes.ConclusionsUsing large-scale social media data, findings provide a deeper understanding of the perceived causes of EDs in the Chinese context from individuals with self-reported EDs and highlight the variations in perceived causes across different self-reported ED types.
Religious mass gatherings are well explored in psychology, however, much research focuses on Hindu and Islamic traditions. The present study investigated how participation in theTraslaciónof the Black Nazarene,a religious mass gathering, mediated the relationship between religious identity and well-being among Catholic devotees in the Philippines. First, we predicted that religious identity influences the participation of devotees in theTraslación—a religious mass gathering in the Philippines in honor of the Black Nazarene. Second, we predicted that by attending theTraslación, participants' collective effervescence and hope would increase. A survey questionnaire was administered among devotees who participated in theTraslación(N= 331). Results indicate that religious identity was associated with participation in the religious mass gathering, which in turn increased the participants' collective effervescence and hope. Moreover, the findings highlight the importance of religious identity in predicting indicators of well-being outcomes via religious mass gatherings. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.
Mobbing is characterized by systematic offensive and reprehensible behaviors perpetrated by one or more individuals toward an individual worker and often has a negative impact on both the victim and the organization. There is a paucity of research examining this issue at a regional level (rural areas) in Portugal; therefore, this study aims to characterize mobbing in a sample of Portuguese workers and explore its relationships with sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, having children, length of service, rotational shift, extra training, level of education, leadership role, and activity sector). A total of455 workers (57.4% female) from São Miguel island (Azores) participated in this study, with ages between 18 and 71 years old (M= 37.8,SD= 12.4). A sociodemographic questionnaire and the Portuguese Mobbing Scale (Vaz-Serra et al., 2005) were used. Results revealed that 19.1% of the sample was a victim of mobbing at least once a week. The higher percentages of mobbing in São Miguel island were found for the following dimensions: demands that affect health (8%), life situation offenses (6.9%) and professional quality offenses (3.4%). The male gender, younger age (i.e., 18-37), not having children, lower length of service (i.e., 1-11), rotational shift were associated with higher levels of mobbing victimization. There were no differences regarding extra training, level of education, leadership role, nor activity sector. These results highlight that some demographic groups are at increased risk for mobbing victimization. Thus, organizational leaders and psychologists that work in these contexts should pay particular attention to these groups and promote a positive work environment, including healthy relationships and job satisfaction.
ObjectivesMuslims represent a significant portion of the global population, and there is an increasing interest in mindfulness within this community. Many Muslims are adopting mindfulness practices to enhance their spiritual and emotional well-being. In response to Wang's "Christian Mindfulness and Global Public Health: A Commentary and Agenda," this study aimed to examine the concept of Islamic mindfulness, its integration within Muslim practices, and its implications for public health outcomes among Muslims.MethodsThis study explored the historical and religious foundations of mindfulness in the Islamic tradition, as well as contemporary psychological perspectives on its practice. The integration of mindfulness with Muslim theistic and cultural frameworks was analyzed, with particular attention to specific forms of mindfulness embedded in daily Islamic rituals and practices.ResultsMindfulness has been a core element of Islamic spirituality for centuries, deeply rooted in Islamic teachings. It serves as a tool for fostering inner peace and tranquility, aligning with principles of present-moment awareness and non-judgmental acceptance of thoughts and emotions. These practices are evident in various aspects of daily life, such as prayer, reflection, and other devotional acts.ConclusionsThe findings of this study highlight the potential of Islamic mindfulness as a means to promote public health and enhance overall well-being among Muslims. By integrating mindfulness practices into everyday life, individuals may achieve improved mental health outcomes and greater emotional resilience, underscoring its relevance as a public health intervention.
The sudden shift to emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic left higher education institutions unprepared to address the diverse needs of international students. While much of the existing research has broadly identified the challenges international students faced, there has been limited focus on in-depth exploration of the impacts on their well-being and stress-coping, particularly for those studying remotely from their home countries. This qualitative study examines the emergency remote learning experiences of fifteen Chinese international doctoral students enrolled in U.S. institutions while living in China during the pandemic. Drawing on semi-structured interviews and social media posts, the study explores the impact of various stressors from cross-border learning contexts on students’ physical, emotional, social, and academic well-being. In response to these challenges, Chinese international doctoral students developed a range of coping strategies, from self-regulation to seeking social-emotional support. However, many also engaged in negative coping due to inadequate support from institutions and instructors. This study contributes to a deeper theoretical understanding of how contextual factors, particularly social and geopolitical influences, shape the learning experiences and stress-coping mechanisms of international doctoral students in remote settings. Additionally, it provides practical recommendations for higher education institutions to incorporate a more humanizing and empathetic approach in future remote learning programs and emergency responses.
The daily report card (DRC) is a commonly used behavioral intervention in which teachers rate child performance on target goals and parents provide home rewards based on the child’s performance. The current study investigated associations between child externalizing problems, empathy, and specific components of the DRC: (1) types of DRC goals that are chosen, (2) teacher and parent adherence to the DRC, and (3) child performance on the DRC. These aims were examined in a sample of 71 children (ages 7–11) who were enrolled in a school-home intervention designed for children with significant inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors. Teachers and parents completed separate baseline measures of inattention (IA), hyperactivity/impulsivity (H/I), conduct problems (CP), and empathy. Outcomes included type of DRC goals (i.e., academic, behavioral, and social-emotional), teacher and parent adherence to the DRC during the initial four-week intervention period, and child DRC performance during the same period. First, IA predicted more academic goals but fewer social-emotional goals, H/I predicted fewer academic goals but more behavioral goals, and CP predicted more social-emotional goals. Second, H/I predicted better parental adherence such that parents rewarded their child’s DRC more frequently. Third, baseline empathy predicted better overall DRC performance; externalizing problems did not negatively impact DRC performance. Results suggest that the DRC is a robust behavioral modification tool that can be tailored to fit each child’s needs and severity of externalizing problems. Empathy may serve as an important factor when designing treatment protocols to improve overall child behavior.
Sexual well-being has long been an area of societal exclusion for disabled people. This exclusion includes control over bodies and relationships, access to representations and public spaces, and autonomy regarding identity choices, lifestyles, and experiences. Innovative and anti-ableist approaches are needed to support sexual well-being among young disabled people. This phenomenological study aimed to explore how social workers can support journeys to achieve sexual well-being from the perspectives of young disabled people. A total of 24 semi-structured interviews were carried out with individuals between the ages of 17 and 24 in Ontario, Canada, who identify themselves as disabled and have had prior interactions with a social worker. The participants had a range of disabilities, including developmental, physical, and mental health. The majority of participants reported having more than one disability. Participants reflected on practice approaches they appreciated when social workers supported them with areas related sexual well-being. More so, they envisioned and recommended various aspects to improve the care and support from social workers. Their suggestions for social workers included increased time and space to develop a therapeutic relationship, unlearning ableism and practicing sex-positivity, accounting for the diverse lived experiences of disabled people, increasing disability representation in social work, and providing and brokering accessible and holistic practice approaches services. This study highlights the importance of holistic and comprehensive social work practice, including sex-positive approaches and multidisciplinary care.
This study aimed to test the psychometric properties of the revised Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of Personality Questionnaire (RST-PQ) using factor analyses, as well as relationships with well-established factors of personality – including the mediating role of personality traits between Fight-Flight- Freeze system (FFFS), Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS), and Behavioral Approach System (BAS) subscales. The study recruited 1,813 Libyan participants across three subsamples, ranging in age from 18 to 66, through convenience and snowball sampling methods via online platforms. In three different subsamples, findings revealed a robust RST-PQ six-factor structure, distinguishing FFFS and BIS, alongside four distinct BAS subscales. Discriminant validity was assessed, indicting Moderate/strong correlations between BIS and Negative Emotionality, and BAS subscales and Extraversion. Moreover, associations with psychological symptoms highlighted BIS’s correlation with anxiety, depression, and stress, and correlations between BAS subscales and personality traits supported their construct validity. Fit indices for the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were χ² = 30,944, df = 1,378, χ²/df = 22.01, CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.92, and RMSEA = 0.04, indicating an acceptable model fit. Gender differences showed females scoring higher in FFFS, BIS, Reward Reactivity, Impulsivity, and Panic responses. Furthermore, structural equation model revealed that personality traits mediated associations between FFFS and BIS, with BAS subscales showing differential predictive patterns. Additionally, separate scales of Defensive Fight and Panic were validated. This research provides the first validation of the RST-PQ in Arabic and highlights the mediating role of personality traits between FFFS, BIS and BAS subscales. Future studies should focus on cultural comparisons and further investigate the predictive validity of RST-PQ scales across different domains (e.g., clinical and occupational).
Recovery is a critical factor in athletic performance, and accelerating this process is essential to enable athletes to perform more effectively in both training load and competitive performance. After exercise, immediate recovery is potentially helpful for investigating autonomic activity levels, as they are definable with heart rate variability (HRV). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of ten sessions of HRV-Biofeedback (HRV-BF) training on recovery process parameters after the aerobic performance. In this study, twenty-four soccer players aged 18–24 volunteered to participate. The athletes who met the research criteria were divided into an experimental group (n= 12) and a control group (n= 12). Each participant’s height, weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and aerobic capacity were measured before and after the 10-session intervention. The experimental group participated in a 10-session HRV-BF training and soccer training program, while the control group only participated in a 10-session soccer training program. Aerobic capacity tests were then applied again to experimental and control group participants. The effect of biofeedback on the three HRV parameters during the 5-minute acute recovery period after the test was investigated. The results showed that regularly applied HRV-BF training can significantly shorten the HRV recovery parameter after exercise. Specifically, the athletes who performed HRV-BF training demonstrated faster cardiovascular recovery after aerobic exercise. This suggests that implementing HRV-BF training for athletes can significantly accelerate their recovery processes during and after competitions. Given recent technological advancements, it is promising to consider adding HRV-BF training to stress management interventions, particularly in relation to physiological stress indicators.
Recent trends in biblical scholarship that have generated new interest in the book of Psalms and in the voice of lamentation may in turn present new opportunities for the liturgical use of psalms of lament. Drawing on the SIFT approach to biblical hermeneutics, the present study tested the ways in which feeling types and thinking types may evaluate Psalm 74 differently. The data demonstrated that feeling types and thinking types approach a psalm of lament in quite different ways. For thinking types, this is a satisfying intellectual exercise. They are caught up by the theological questions raised and fascinated by the capacity of the human mind to challenge God to keep God’s side of the covenantal agreement with the people. For feeling types, this is a journey of the heart as they identify with the protagonists rehearsing the source and cause of their pain. Preachers and liturgists need to be aware of this contrast.
The assessment of color vision is crucial in both fundamental visual research and clinical diagnosis. However, existing tools for color vision assessment are limited by various factors. This study introduces a novel, efficient method for color vision assessment, which is based on a continuous motion tracking task and a Kalman filter model. The effectiveness of this new method was evaluated by assessing the color vision of both color-deficient observers and normal controls. The results from both a small sample (N= 29, Experiment1) and a large sample (N= 171, Experiment2) showed that color-deficient observers could be perfectly identified within 20 s using the tracking performance. We also compared the new method with a traditional psychophysical detection task to examine the consistency of perceptual noise estimation between the two methods, and the results showed a moderate correlation (Pearson'sr= .59 ~ .64). The results also demonstrated that the new method could measure individuals’ contrast response functions of both red–green and blue–yellow colors (e.g., the L–M and S–(L + M) axes in DKL color space) in just a few minutes, showing much higher efficiency than traditional methods. All the findings from this study indicate that the continuous motion tracking method is a promising tool for both rapid screening of color vision deficiencies and fundamental research on color vision.
Accurate eye tracking is crucial for gaze-dependent research, but calibrating eye trackers in subjects who cannot follow instructions, such as human infants and nonhuman primates, presents a challenge. Traditional calibration methods rely on verbal instructions, which are ineffective for these populations. To address this, researchers often use attention-grabbing stimuli in known locations; however, existing software for video-based calibration is often proprietary and inflexible. We introduce an extension to the open-source toolbox Titta—a software package integrating desktop Tobii eye trackers with PsychToolbox experiments—to facilitate custom video-based calibration. This toolbox extension offers a flexible platform for attracting attention, calibrating using flexible point selection, and validating the calibration. The toolbox has been refined through extensive use with chimpanzees, baboons, and macaques, demonstrating its effectiveness across species. Our adaptive calibration and validation procedures provide a standardized method for achieving more accurate gaze tracking, enhancing gaze accuracy across diverse species.
Quigley and colleagues described a treatment recommendation scenario within a multidisciplinary team setting for an adult with a developmental disability. The authors presented the information in a standard format to share how the involved parties identified, evaluated, and responded to the recommendation based upon their understanding of ethical decision-making. The core ethical principles mandated by behavioral ethics were described precisely, with the required recommendation crystal clear and unwavering. The recipient of such advise would know exactly what to think and how to react to such a treatment recommendation should they be in a similar situation in their respective clinical setting.
In all phases of life, people face decisions with important consequences. Weighing options involves using cognitive resources to assess valence, delay, and risk to achieve a desired outcome. Value-based decision-making changes over the lifespan, but studies disagree on the extent, domains, and mechanisms of this change. We assessed delay discounting, risk aversion for probabilistic gains, risk seeking for probabilistic losses, loss aversion as well as cognitive abilities, and processing noise in 86 young (25–38 years) and 93 older (63–76 years) adults. We tested whether decision-making differed between age groups and whether differences were mediated by cognitive abilities or processing noise as measured by reaction time variability and decision inconsistency. Older adults showed steeper delay discounting (p= .003) and trended towards more risk aversion for gains (p= .071). Age groups did not differ in risk seeking for losses or loss aversion. Lower decision consistency and better spatial working memory mediated older adults’ steeper delay discounting. The relationship between delay discounting and age persisted when controlling for both mediators, suggesting robust age differences in delay discounting. This persistent age difference implies mechanisms beyond noise or cognitive parameters, such as changing life circumstances or limited future perspective.
Contemporary schema theories state that schema formation relies on early maladaptive experiences regarding the frustration of core emotional needs in childhood and adolescence. However, within a broad schema perspective on human emotion and cognition, it is plausible to assume that individuals may also develop adaptive schemas based on adaptive relational experiences. Despite recent studies addressing positive schemas, a clear theoretical articulation between maladaptive and adaptive core schemas is lacking. In this sense, the present paper introduces the notion of the Dialectical Core Schemas, based on empirical data. One hundred and seventy-four participants (Mage= 22.6,SD= 9.4) fulfilled self-report questionnaires in a cross-sectional design. Correlational data showed that adaptive core self and other schemas were positively correlated with wellbeing, while maladaptive core self and other schemas were negatively correlated with wellbeing and positively correlated with symptomatology. Adaptive and maladaptive core self-schemas mediated the relationship between psychological well-being and symptomatology. Results partially support theoretical claims showing that individuals may hold simultaneously adaptive and maladaptive core schemas about the self and others. Oppositional schemas may be framed in dialectical poles suggesting that schema activation may be dimensional rather than categorical. Implications regarding developmental perspectives, case conceptualization, and clinical decision-making are discussed.
BackgroundTo date, over 1.3 billion videos with the hashtag #bodyneutrality have been viewed on TikTok. Despite this, little existing literature has unpacked how body neutrality is conceptualised on TikTok. We examined how TikTok creators construct meaning and generate discourse surrounding #bodyneutrality.MethodsExtending on previous works in the body neutrality space, we conducted a hybrid content/thematic analysis of TikTok videos in three different languages (English, Spanish, and Italian). Initially, 300 videos displaying “#bodyneutrality” were identified on TikTok. The first 178 TikTok videos were analysed, following the principles of data saturation and feasibility.ResultsWe developed three themes: (1) The normalisation of diverse bodies, (2) The rejection of appearance as fundamentally important, and (3) Body neutrality is (better than) body positivity.ConclusionsIn line with conceptualisations of body neutrality in existing literature, some content emphasised the importance of devaluing physical appearance. Building on existing definitions, most creators also framed body neutrality as speaking to the fundamental humanness of owning a body and attempted to normalise various body shapes/sizes. Conversely, some content employed #bodyneutrality to promote or examine body positivity principles or to condemn appearance-based stigmatisation. Our study is one of the first to examine how body neutrality is understood and employed by people in the real world.
Although there is a link between peer victimization, emotional symptoms, and disability or chronic condition in adolescence, less is known about the role of stable, individual differences compared to developmental processes. The current study addressed this gap by examining developmental relations between peer victimization, emotional symptoms, and disability or chronic condition. Three waves of self-report panel data on Swedish adolescents at ages 13, 15, and 17 years (n= 734; 51.6% girls) were used. Data were analyzed using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models with invariance tests by sex, disability/chronic condition, and family affluence. Girls and adolescents with a disability or chronic condition showed more heterogeneity in the co-development of peer victimization and emotional symptoms, with girls being more prone than boys to developing emotional symptoms following peer victimization, and particularly in early adolescence. Girls and adolescents with a disability or chronic condition had elevated within-person levels of both peer victimization and emotional symptoms throughout adolescence. Theory and practice may need to pay additional attention to the role of sex, disability, and their intersection, as well as age, regarding the development of peer victimization and emotional symptoms.
IntroductionThe study aimed to investigate the impact of an information-based preparation program on the psychological safety of adolescents admitted to pediatric wards, emphasizing the importance of enhancing patient safety.MethodsThis quasi-experimental study was conducted among 98 adolescents admitted to pediatric wards at Namazi Hospital, managed by Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, in 2021. The participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group using an electronic randomization table. The intervention group received an information-based preparation program, while the control group followed routine care. Adolescents completed the Psychological Safety Questionnaire after admission and at discharge. Data were analyzed using SPSS (Version 22), with a significance level of 0.05.ResultsThe mean psychological safety scores before the intervention were 136.73 ± 17.30 in the control group and 141.03 ± 16.34 in the intervention group, with no significant difference between the two groups (p= 0.20). After the intervention, the mean scores were 136.65 ± 19.01 in the control group and 145.50 ± 14.05 in the intervention group. A comparison of the mean psychological safety scores showed a significant difference between the two groups after the intervention (p= 0.01).ConclusionsThe findings of this study indicate that the information-based preparation program positively affected the psychological safety of hospitalized adolescents. Therefore, it is recommended that nurses incorporate this method into therapeutic programs for hospitalized adolescents to enhance their psychological safety effectively.
According to recent polling, many individuals perceive that universities may limit the freedom of speech of students who hold certain political views. Whereas research has shown that university members who perceive political hostility are more likely to self-censor, few studies have examined how perceived political discrimination affects students’ self-censorship. Thus, this study explored whether perceived political discrimination felt by college students predicts self-censorship in university settings. In Study 1 (N = 163), we found that students who perceived more frequent discrimination reported more self-censorship, regardless of political orientation. In Study 2 (N = 169), we found that Republican students, but not Democrat or Independent students, who believed that they were political minorities at their university were more likely to self-censor if they perceived political discrimination. These findings provide insights into the ongoing discussions about academic freedom and freedom of speech.
IntroductionThe incidence of PCOS is notably elevated in Iran, making it crucial to examine the quality of life among these individuals. This study aimed to thoroughly evaluate the psychometric properties of the Iranian adaptations of the PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42 questionnaires. The application of these tools is significant as they could enhance further research in in communities with similar social norms concerning marriage and sexuality.MethodsThis study employed a cross-sectional design. Following the linguistic validation of the Iranian adaptation of the PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42, a panel of experts reviewed the items through an evaluation of the content validity index (CVI) and content validity ratio (CVR). Subsequently, a semi-structured interview was carried out to evaluate face validity. Consequently, discriminant validity was assessed using the known groups comparison. Convergent validity was evaluated by assessing the correlation between similar content on the PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42, SF-12 and body image questionnaire. Responsiveness was assessed by comparing two scales scoring in baseline and eight-week follow-up data of prescription contraceptive Daine-35. In addition, reliability analyses including internal consistency and test–retest analysis were carried out.ResultsThe CVR in this study for the total scale was 0.98 for two scales, indicating a satisfactory result. The CVI for the scale was found to be 0.98 and 0.99 for PCOSQoL-42 and PCOSQoL-47, respectively suggesting that it had a good content validity. Known groups comparison revealed that the two scales effectively distinguished between sub-groups of women with varying symptoms specific to PCOS, thereby supporting their discriminant validity. Additionally, convergent validity was evaluated and, as anticipated, a strong positive correlation was observed between corresponding subscales of the two instruments. The paired t-test showed significant changes in PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42 scores (p< 0.001) indicating as a responsive outcome measure to detect significant changes over time before and after treatment. Additional analyses indicated satisfactory results of PCOSQoL-42 for internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.72 to 0.78) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ranging 0.67 to 0.92;P< 0.05). regarding PCOSQoL-47, Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.80 to 0.82 and intraclass correlation coefficients (ranging 0.61 to 0.73;P< 0.05).ConclusionThe PCOSQoL-47 and PCOSQoL-42 have undergone thorough testing in Iran and may be utilized as outcome measures in forthcoming studies within this demographic.
IntroductionDuring the summer of 2022, monkeypox (mpox) became a public health emergency primarily affecting members of sexual and gender minority (SGM) communities. Understanding how SGM social media users perceived mpox could inform community-based public health prevention strategies for future disease outbreaks. However, social media platform selection could substantially affect the insights drawn about mpox.MethodsThe present study used topic modeling and tested differences in psycholinguistic attributes using 8,605 mpox-related Reddit posts and 1,819 mpox-related tweets collected from 01 May 2022 to 13 October 2022.ResultsResults showed substantial differences in mpox communication themes between the two groups. The SGM-specific Reddit sample primarily discussed concerns with how mpox predominately affects gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, desires to find and share information about mpox vaccination, and motives to understand how mpox spreads among the community. The non-SGM-specific Twitter sample primarily discussed news reports about mpox cases provided by U.S. agencies, mpox from an international perspective, and concerns about mpox in the context of COVID-19. Group differences in psycholinguistic attributes were also evident.ConclusionsOur findings underscore the importance of community-centered public health surveillance because mpox communication differed significantly between SGM-specific Reddit communities vs. non-SGM-specific Twitter users. Public health surveillance using social media must account for these communication differences, as conclusions about a population’s reaction to disease can differ substantially based on the platform surveyed.Policy ImplicationsPublic health officials can use these findings to design community- and platform-tailored prevention messaging for future outbreaks of mpox and other infectious diseases.
The zero-COVID-19 policy was proven to be effective in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 but has had significant impacts on people’s emotions, time perspectives, and decision-making. The current study performed five rounds of data collection (N= 1095) to investigate the time perspectives, emotions, and wisdom experiences of individuals under the zero-COVID-19 policy implementation. Hierarchical linear modeling and generalized linear hypothesis testing revealed that a balanced time perspective is the most powerful time perspective predictor of wisdom and that emotional diversity is the most powerful emotional predictor of wisdom. Moreover, emotional diversity exhibits distinct boundary effects. More precisely, among emotional indicators, “non-pessimism” is the most reliable predictor of wisdom. The moderation effect analysis showed that heightened emotional diversity amplifies the beneficial effect of a balanced time perspective on wisdom. All these effects are consistent across the zero-COVID period. This finding suggests that maintaining a balanced time perspective during a major public crisis might contribute to wise decision-making.
For many children with significant behavioral health needs, the inability to obtain funding for adequate behavioral health care through private means results in parents “voluntarily” placing their child in the state’s child welfare system. This study investigated the association between states’ use of 1915(c) Medicaid waivers for children with behavioral health needs and state rates of voluntary foster care placements. This study used data from the Children’s Bureau Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS), from 2010 to 2019. Multilevel, linear regression models with state-year fixed-effects assessed the relationship between states’ use of a 1915(c) waiver and their total new entry voluntary foster care placement rates for children with behavioral or developmental health care needs, controlling for a variety of state-level policy and demographic characteristics. States’ use of 1915(c) waivers is significantly associated with lower total voluntary placement rates, both in total (β= -1.51 [-2.82, -0.21]) and proportionally (β=-1.03 [-2.07, 0.02]). HCBS Medicaid waivers targeting children with complex behavioral health needs may reduce state rates of voluntary foster care placements.
Research has shown that parental involvement is regarded as a fundamental contributor to children’s school success but there are currently only a few measures available to assess the degree of parental involvement in children’s learning experiences. The Parent and Family Involvement in Education Survey (PFIES) was created to assess parent and family involvement in children’s educational activities and was administered in 2007 as part of the National Household Education Survey (NHES). Although the items from the PFIES were assumed to be meaningful descriptions of parent involvement in children’s educational activities, the utility of these items as a measure of parental involvement was never assessed. This study used items from the PFIES and examined them as a new measure called the Parent Involvement Survey (PIS). Specifically, the study examined the underlying factor structure, the internal consistency, and convergent validity of the emerging measure. The same population of parents were utilized for two samples (n= 315 andn= 316). The results provided support for a 29-item measure with an oblique six-factor solution. The new instrument shows promise as a parsimonious measure for assessing the level of parental involvement in young children’s learning and educational activities. With more accurate information about parental involvement, better management and intervention solutions can be created, which subsequently leads to improved child educational outcomes.
Psychological flexibility provides the ability to react upon and adapt to challenges across the lifespan, including thoughts, feelings or events, in a way that is consistent with personal values, thereby enhancing or sustaining wellbeing. The aim of this study is to improve our understanding of age-graded differences in psychological flexibility, by examining the relationship between (subcomponents of) psychological flexibility and age in a Dutch general population sample (N = 1770; Mage (SD) = 55.77 (14.31); 36.3% men and 63.7% women). The results show that the relationship between age and psychological flexibility was not significant when accounting for demographical variables, positive and negative affect. However, there was a significant relationship between age and five of the six subcomponents. Demographic variables (education, marital status, employment), as well as positive and negative affect, played a significant role, underscoring the importance of incorporating affective factors in future research on psychological flexibility. Additionally, the results have implication for future research, particularly in assessing interindividual trajectories through sequential longitudinal designs, and practical implication, especially valuable in our modern society with current challenges.
In several ways, 2018 represents a global pivot point in research and care related to the intersection of gender diversity and autism, reflected by the increase in the number of studies on the intersection and broadening of topics. We conducted a scoping review of the literature published between September 2018 and January 2024 to summarize recent research in the field. We compared and contrasted research trends post September 2018 to research that was summarized in previous scoping reviews (Nordahl-Hansen et al. in J Autism Develop Disord 49:1745–1748, 2019; Øien et al. J Autism Develop Disord. We also summarized systematic reviews and meta-analyses published after 2018. Compared to previous reviews, we included more comprehensive search terms to focus on gender diversity broadly, rather than just gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder, and we included more detailed coding categories to uniquely identify shifts and continuities in research priorities over time. A total of 99 empirical research studies were published after August 2018 (the end of the search in the previous review) and through January 2024 on autism, gender diversity, and related topics were reviewed. There has been growth in the quantity and quality of studies on the intersection of autism and gender diversity, although methodological improvements are still needed and described in the current review. Future research should include more collaborations with stakeholders to set research priorities that are reflective of the communities being described.
BackgroundThe Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess cognitive flexibility. Despite its widespread use, its psychometric properties have yet to be evaluated in the Italian context. Furthermore, while cognitive flexibility has emerged as a central correlate in Feeding and Eating Disorders, only a limited number of studies have investigated its association with Orthorexia Nervosa (ON), a clinical condition characterized by a pathological fixation with healthy eating. The present study aimed to fill these two knowledge gaps.MethodsA total of 803 participants (Mage= 33.89, SD = 9.44; 68.6% females) were enrolled in the investigation. The sample was randomly split into two subsamples: the first one for examining the psychometric properties of the CFS, and the second one for evaluating its association with ON symptoms. Participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing the constructs under investigation.ResultsConfirmatory factor analysis revealed a global dimension of cognitive flexibility, alongside a method factor accounting for covariance arising by reverse-worded items. The CFS, which was factorially invariant across genders, yielded a reliable total score (ω = 0.834) and provided evidence of convergent and criterion-related validity. Importantly, structural equation modelling showed that cognitive flexibility was negatively associated with emotional distress resulting from violations of orthorexic dietary rules (β = -0.279,p< .001).ConclusionsThe CFS demonstrated to be a psychometrically robust instrument in the Italian context. Moreover, cognitive flexibility may be an important treatment target for mitigating the distress derived from ON symptoms, informing the development of future therapeutic approaches.
ObjectiveGrandparental care has become a common phenomenon, yet there is still limited research on the long-term psychological effects on children raised by their grandparents. This study aims to explore the impact of early grandparental care experiences on university students’ social networking sites addiction, social anxiety, and loneliness.MethodsA random cluster sampling method was employed to select college students from a medical school in Jiangxi for a questionnaire survey. The study measured social networking sites addiction, social anxiety, and loneliness using the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS), Interaction Anxiety Scale (IAS), and Loneliness Scale (ULS-6) respectively. Additionally, grandparental care was assessed through individual questions. Data analysis was conducted using mediated effects modeling.ResultsIn total, 4318 participants were recruited. 45.2% of participants were male and 54.8% were female. The study found a significant positive association between grandparental care experience and social networking sites addiction, social anxiety, and loneliness. The study revealed that social anxiety mediated 20.0% of the effect between grandparental care experiences and social networking sites addiction, while loneliness mediated 16.0% of this effect. Moreover, social anxiety and loneliness together mediated 12.0% of the chained effects between grandparental care experiences and social networking sites addiction.ConclusionGrandparental care has no direct impact on social networking sites addiction in adulthood. Social anxiety and loneliness play a mediating role between grandparental care and social networking sites addiction. Therefore, schools and families should prioritize efforts to enhance the physical and mental well-being of individuals receiving grandparental care. This can be achieved through targeted health promotion initiatives.
BackgroundPsychotherapeutic competencies encompass a variety of skills that influence the work and therapeutic success of psychotherapists. In particular, interpersonal skills and the associated ability to react appropriately in complex therapy situations have already shown significant correlations with later therapeutic success. Strengthening interpersonal skills should therefore be a central aim of psychotherapy training. However, previous studies have shown that not only content learning is decisive for later learning success and skill development, but also the didactic method has a significant effect. Deliberate Practice and Structured Feedback have shown to be promising didactic tools. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Deliberate Practice and Structured Feedback as well as their combination in the context of psychotherapy training in comparison to classic didactic training. The trainees’ learning progress of interpersonal skills and its influence on subsequent outpatient therapies will be examined. Secondary, the study aims to identify further determinants of trainees’ therapeutic skills and to investigate the effects of ruptures on the course of therapy.MethodsThe underlying study, a randomized-control-trial with three intervention groups (Deliberate Practice, Structured Feedback, combination of both) and an active control group, will be conducted on a sample ofN= 240 trainees and their patients (N= 1000). All trainees will each attend three consecutive workshops on “Strengthening therapeutic skills in challenging therapy situations”, which will be carried out using the corresponding didactic tool. Scientific assessments will take place online for the trainees (pre, in-between, post, follow-up) and for the patients (after each therapy session for 24 weeks, follow-up). Primary outcomes will be constituted by the trainees’ Facilitative Interpersonal Skills and the patients’ symptoms. Multilevel as well as structural equation modelling will be used to analyze the data.DiscussionThe study investigates the efficacy of different didactic tools regarding the strengthening of trainee’s interpersonal competencies as well as their effects on subsequent therapies. Results of this study address a research gap concerning the improvement of psychotherapy training as well as the quality assurance of future therapies.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trial Register (DRKS) – DRKS00034279; retrospectively registered.
Studies suggest that mid-level features could underlie object animacy perception. In the current research, we tested whether ensemble animacy perception is based on high- or mid-level features. We used five types of images of animals and inanimate objects: color, grayscale, silhouettes, texforms – unrecognizable images that preserve mid-level texture and shape information – and scrambled images. In the series of Experiments 1, we asked participants to evaluate the animacy of single images and sets of eight images using a 10-point scale. In the series of Experiments 2, participants were shown two sets of eight images and had to choose a more animate one in the two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task. We found that in both paradigms, observers could report the mean animacy of the set of texform images without direct access to information about high-level features. Thus, ensemble animacy could be extracted only based on mid-level features such as shape and texture without access to more high-level information.
Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) encounter difficulties in acquiring various language structures. Early identification and intervention are crucial to prevent negative long-term outcomes impacting the academic, social, and emotional development of children. The study aims to develop an automated method for the identification of DLD using artificial intelligence, specifically a neural network machine learning algorithm. This protocol is applied for the first time in a Cypriot Greek child population with DLD. The neural network model was trained using perceptual and production data elicited from 15 children with DLD and 15 healthy controls in the age range of 7;10–10;4. Thek-fold technique was used to cross-validate the algorithm. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve/AUC to assess its ability to make accurate predictions on a set of unseen data. The results demonstrated high classification values for all metrics, indicating the high accuracy of the neural model in classifying children with DLD. Furthermore, a variable importance analysis revealed that the language production skills of children had a more significant impact on the performance of the model compared to perception skills. Machine learning paradigms provide effective discrimination between children with DLD and those with TD, with the potential to enhance clinical assessment and facilitate earlier and more efficient detection of the disorder.
Experimenters often ask subjects to rate displays in terms of high-level visual properties, such as animacy. When do such studies measure subjects’ visual impressions, and when do they merely reflect their judgments that certain featuresshouldindicate animacy? Here we introduce the ‘Blindfold Test’ for helping to evaluate the evidence for whether an effect reflects perception or judgment. If the same effect can be obtained not only with visual displays but also by simplydescribingthose displays, then subjects’ responses may reflect higher-level reasoning rather than visual processing—and so other evidence is needed in order to support a ‘perceptual’ interpretation. We applied the Blindfold Test to three past studies in which observers made subjective reports about what they were seeing. In the first two examples, subjects rated stimuli in terms of high-level properties: animacy and physical forces. In both cases, the key findings replicated even when the visual stimuli were replaced with (mere) descriptions, and we conclude that these studies cannot by themselves license conclusions about perception. In contrast, a third example (involving motion-induced blindness) passed the test: subjects produced very different responses when given descriptions of the displays, compared to the visual stimuli themselves—providing compelling evidence that the original responses did not merely reflect such higher-level reasoning. The Blindfold Test may thus help to constrain interpretations of the mental processes underlying certain experimental results—especially for studies of properties that can be apprehended by both seeing and thinking.
The current study evaluated the effectiveness of relational training on the establishment of three deictic framing repertoires (I/You, Now/Then, Here/There) in an eight-year-old autistic boy using a multiple baseline across behaviors design. Relational training was effective in establishing all three directly trained and mutually entailed deictic relations, while differences were observed in transformation of stimulus function. Results support previous findings with the systematic development of multiple types of perspective taking repertoires with the same participant.
CBT-i Coach is a free, publicly available mobile health application (app) that provides users with the core intervention components of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i). By making these components directly accessible to users, CBT-i Coach potentially circumvents barriers to accessing CBT-i, such as a scarcity of and lack of referral to trained providers. It may also serve a preventative function by helping address sleep disruption before it reaches clinical levels. However, no study to date has investigated the potential effectiveness of CBT-i Coach for either of these two purposes in public, naturalistic use. This study observed public CBT-i Coach use over an 18-month period to investigate whether users reporting either clinical or subclinical insomnia symptoms (N= 1618) showed improvement in insomnia symptoms, sleep efficiency, and sleep quality while using the app and whether clinically meaningful engagement with the app was associated with improvements. Users’ insomnia symptoms, sleep efficiency, and sleep quality improved while using CBT-i Coach (d= 0.57, 0.41, and 0.24, respectively). Regarding clinically meaningful engagement, greater engagement with the My Sleep (b= − 0.004) and Tools (b= − 0.050) sections were associated with lower final insomnia symptoms, and greater engagement with the My Sleep section (b= 0.012) was associated with higher final sleep quality. CBT-i Coach therefore appears to be a valuable public health tool to improve sleep. It may also provide a preventative service by addressing sleep disruption among those with subclinical symptom levels who otherwise might not have access to CBT-i.
Self-compassion is an individual’s ability to exercise mindfulness and self-kindness toward their own suffering, and it has been well-established as a protective factor for psychological well-being. Parents’ self-compassion may be especially important for emotion-related parenting practices, as parents’ own emotions may impact how they respond to their children’s emotions. Parent emotion socialization has implications for youth emotion regulation and psychosocial adjustment. The present study examined the effects of parent self-compassion on parent emotion socialization and its indirect effect on adolescent emotion dysregulation, using the PROCESS macro. Adolescents (n= 141;M= 14.56 years; 65% cisgender male) and their parents completed questionnaires via the Qualtrics platform in the United States. Parent self-compassion directly related to less unsupportive emotion socialization responses and adolescent emotion dysregulation, but it was unrelated to supportive emotion socialization. Parent self-compassion indirectly related to lower adolescent emotion dysregulation through unsupportive parent emotion socialization, but not supportive parent emotion socialization. Parents’ self-compassion mitigated unsupportive emotion socialization behaviors in a manner that corresponded to less adolescent emotion dysregulation. These findings represent an important addition to existing theoretical models of parent characteristics relevant for parent emotion socialization. Bolstering parent self-compassion is a possible avenue to support adaptive emotion-related parenting practices and adolescent psychosocial adjustment.
BackgroundUnderstanding wellbeing in adolescents and within education settings is crucial to supporting young people. However, research defining and exploring wellbeing has typically taken a focus on subjective, psychological, social and emotional domains and has failed to incorporate aspects of physical health and wellbeing. This study aimed to explore how both physical and subjective and psychological wellbeing can be combined to generate different profiles of wellbeing in adolescents, and to understand the characteristics associated with this profile membership.Methods366 adolescents aged 11-16yrs (mean age 12.75) from three mainstream secondary schools across England completed an online survey capturing demographic characteristics, physical, subjective and psychological wellbeing, physical activity, emotional literacy, school belonging, and perceptions of learning ability. Latent profile analysis used a data driven approach to explore profiles of wellbeing using physical wellbeing and positive emotional state and positive outlook as predictors of profile membership. To understand profile characteristics demographics, physical activity and educational variables were added as co-variates.ResultsThree profiles were identified, (1) low wellbeing (n= 68, 19%) displaying low scores across physical wellbeing, positive emotional state and positive outlook, (2) moderate wellbeing (n= 168, 46%) characterised by average levels across physical wellbeing, positive emotional state and positive outlook, and (3) high wellbeing (n= 128, 35%) showing high score across physical wellbeing, positive emotional state and positive outlook. Compared to the high wellbeing profile, the moderate and low profiles membership was characterised by being older, being a girl, lower perceived socio-economic status, fewer hours of physical activity a week, and lower emotional literacy, school belonging and perceptions of learning.ConclusionsThe results evidence that physical, subjective and psychological wellbeing are closely inter-related, this finding coupled with increased physical activity in the higher wellbeing group signify physical health and activity are important components of overall wellbeing and should form part of a holistic approach to school wellbeing curriculums.
Technology offers exciting possibilities for instruction with learners with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but limited research has evaluated the use of web-based applications (apps) as learning tools for this population. We wondered if using apps would function as a precurrent response to solve problems in the form of questions on a worksheet. Participants were two adolescents with ASD, Phoebe and Gavin. We taught them to use map, weather, and clock apps to answer questions about distance, temperature, and time on a worksheet (e.g., “What time is it in Cairo?”). The cities varied to ensure the answers were always unknown. Training occurred for one app at a time in the manner of a multiple baseline design across behaviors. Training steps were progressively introduced to evaluate the components necessary for app use. Gavin progressed quickly through training with the first app and then demonstrated generalization across novel questions (i.e., with different cities), apps, and response modalities (i.e., answering vocally). Phoebe required more intensive training than Gavin, and eventually demonstrated generalization across novel questions. We discuss the implications of expanding technology-based problem-solving skills by applying Skinner’s (1957;1984) analysis.
There has been a recent surge of naturalistic methodology to assess complex topics in psychology and neuroscience. Such methods are lauded for their increased ecological validity, aiming to bridge a gap between highly controlled experimental design and purely observational studies. However, these measures present challenges in establishing construct validity. One domain in which this has emerged is research on theory of mind: the ability to infer others’ thoughts and emotions. Traditional measures utilize rigid methodology which suffer from ceiling effects and may fail to fully capture how individuals engage theory of mind in everyday interactions. In the present study, we validate and test a novel approach utilizing a naturalistic task to assess theory of mind. Participants watched a mockumentary-style show while using a joystick to provide continuous, real-time theory of mind judgments. A baseline sample’s ratings were used to establish a “ground truth” for the judgments. Ratings from separate young and older adult samples were compared against the ground truth to create similarity scores. This similarity score was compared against two independent tasks to assess construct validity: an explicit judgment performance-based paradigm, and a neuroimaging paradigm assessing response to a static measure of theory of mind. The similarity metric did not have ceiling effects and was significantly positively related to both the performance-based and neural measures. It also replicated age effects that other theory of mind measures demonstrate. Together, our multimodal approach provided convergent evidence that dynamic measures of behavior can yield robust and rigorous assessments of complex psychological processes.

This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to provide accurate estimates of concreteness, valence, and arousal for multi-word expressions. Unlike previous artificial intelligence (AI) methods, LLMs can capture the nuanced meanings of multi-word expressions. We systematically evaluated GPT-4o's ability to predict concreteness, valence, and arousal. In Study1, GPT-4o showed strong correlations with human concreteness ratings (r = .8) for multi-word expressions. In Study2, these findings were repeated for valence and arousal ratings of individual words, matching or outperforming previous AI models. Studies3–5extended the valence and arousal analysis to multi-word expressions and showed good validity of the LLM-generated estimates for these stimuli as well. To help researchers with stimulus selection, we provide datasets with LLM-generated norms of concreteness, valence, and arousal for 126,397 English single words and 63,680 multi-word expressions.
Psychologists and neuroscientists often use complex span tasks or then-back to measure working memory capacity. At first glance, both tasks require many cognitive processes attributed to the construct, including the maintenance of information amidst interference. Nevertheless, evidence for their convergent validity is mixed. This poses consequences for the interpretation of working memory performance in cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology, applied psychology, and executive functioning research. We recruited a large and diverse sample using a multisite approach (N= 1,272; community and university participants) and had them complete multiple working memory capacity, updating, and fluid intelligence tests. We found strong evidence for a dissociation between complex span andn-back tests, and more broadly, between working memory capacity and updating factors. Observed correlations between complex span andn-back performance were modest (r̄= .25), and at the latent level, the two factors only shared 20% of their variance. Each explained unique variance in fluid intelligence, and each was more strongly related to fluid intelligence than to each other, with updating measures demonstrating stronger relations to fluid intelligence. These results were interpreted via thedisengagement hypothesis. What distinguishes updating measures from working memory capacity measures is their relative emphasis on disengagement from outdated information; disengagement drives their strong relation with fluid intelligence because problem-solving requires generating hypotheses but also discarding those discovered to be false. We suggest that researchers who want to measure and draw conclusions about working memory capacity or updating should not use complex span tasks and then-back interchangeably.
The present study introduces affective norms for a set of 880 German words rated by learners of German as a second language (L2), i.e., the Affective Norms for German as a Second Language (ANGL2). The database provides ratings across affective and subjective psycholinguistic dimensions. Besides valence and arousal ratings, ANGL2 features data on emotional prototypicality, which helps to identify emotion-label words and emotion-laden words. Moreover, the database includes two additional semantic variables: concreteness and familiarity. We observed similarities with previous studies, and the ratings provided by L2 speakers demonstrate characteristics that should be noted in studies involving bilinguals, including more moderate valence ratings, and a stronger correlation between valence and arousal, specifically for positive words. ANGL2 is the first set of affective norms that has been rated by L2 speakers for a language other than English. The set of norms is aimed to function as a resource for psycholinguistic experimental studies on the intersection between emotion and language among L2 speakers.
IntroductionSyphilisis a common comorbidity among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The factors that influence the occurrence of coinfection are not yet well understood.MethodsWe investigated the prevalence of syphilis and potential risk factors among people living with HIV (PLWH) in China from January 2018 to December 2022. Patients included were newly diagnosed, older than 18 years of age, and had first started standard antiretroviral therapy for HIV. All patients completed face-to-face questionnaire surveys and laboratory tests. Pearson’s Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables and Student’s t-test was used to compare continuous variables. Logistic regression estimated the odds ratios and 95% CIs for associations between various factors and syphilis coinfection.ResultsAmong the 1391 patients with HIV, 1323 met the eligibility criteria. A total of 254 participants were coinfection with syphilis, with a prevalence of 19.20%. The prevalence of coinfection was highest in the illiterate/primary/junior high school group at 23.1% (95% confidence interval (CI),18.3–27.9%), followed by the high school group at 21.4% (95% CI, 16.4–26.4%), and the university/postgraduate group at 16.5% (95% CI, 13.9–19.2%). There was a significant difference in the number of sex partners between the HIV-infected and coinfection groups (5.8 ± 6.3 vs. 9.1 ± 11.3,p< 0.001). The prevalence of coinfection was higher in the CD4count < 200 group than in the CD4count > 400 group (p< 0.05). Anxiety scores in the coinfection group were also significantly higher than those in the non-coinfection group (p< 0.05). Logistic regression analyses found that below high school education (odds ratio (OR), 95% CI: 1.48, 1.11 ~ 1.97,p= 0.009), CD4count of less than 200 (OR, 95% CI: 1.45, 1.07 ~ 1.97,p= 0.016), five or more sexual partners (OR, 95% CI: 2.09, 1.58 ~ 2.78,p< 0.001), and anxiety (OR, 95% CI: 2.09, 1.58 ~ 2.78,p= 0.035) were more likely to exhibit coinfection.ConclusionsImproving literacy levels, reducing the number of sexual partners, raising CD4levels, and reducing stress may help reduce the occurrence of syphilis in patients with HIV.Policy ImplicationsPeople living with HIV could benefit from increasing the frequency of syphilis testing for early detection and improving health education.
Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) allow for investigating the functional involvement of specific brain areas in mental arithmetic. In this study, we employed for the first time high-definition (HD)-tDCS, which offers enhanced spatial precision, to explore the functional roles of the left and right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in mental arithmetic. A total of 25 participants underwent anodal left IPS, anodal right IPS, and sham stimulation in separate sessions in counterbalanced order while solving single- and multi-step addition and subtraction problems. We found that stimulation of the left IPS, but not the right IPS or sham stimulation, improved arithmetic performance speed. These results provide further evidence for the functional involvement of the left IPS in a broad range of arithmetic tasks and highlight the potential of NIBS for cognitive enhancement.
BackgroundMental health is indispensable for satisfaction of humanity and the sustainability of economic and social development. Depression is an important negative manifestation of mental health. The progress of network infrastructure might offer an innovation against the prevalence of depression. However, the association between depression and network infrastructure has received limited attention in existing researches.ObjectivesTo address the gap, this study aims to empirically investigate the depressive disorder benefits of network infrastructure taking “Broadband China Pilot Policy” (BCPP) as a quasi-natural experiment.MethodsBased on the data of 8,740 individuals living in 125 prefecture-level or above cities across China in 2013, 2015, and 2018 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), the multi-phase difference-to-difference (DID) model was utilized to examine the effect of BCPP on individual depression.ResultsThe implement of BCPP was negatively correlated with the individual’s depression degree. The observations still held after a series of robustness tests. Moreover, the effects of BCPP on the risk of depression were more considerable in south or densely populated regions.ProspectionsThese findings could deepen the understandings of the favorable implications of network infrastructure in alleviating individual depression, which have provided theoretical and practical reference for giving full play to the empowering role of network infrastructure and alleviating individual depression.
Sensation seeking is the pursuit of varied, novel, and complex experiences and has been the subject of many studies since the 1950s. Research has demonstrated sensation seeking traits are related to risk-taking, including use and abuse of substances as well as physical risk-taking such as participation in extreme sports. Researchers have developed multiple measures to assess individual differences in sensation seeking. The most used measures for adults have weaknesses, such as conflating traits with behaviors, using out-of-date language, and low internal consistency. In the present research we carried out a series of studies in which we developed and validated a brief measure of sensation. The final version of the measure contained seven adjectives that participants rated how accurately each described them. The results showed that scores on the new measure were positively related to scores on two popular measures of sensation-seeking (i.e., the SSS-V and the AISS) as well as to two measures of risk-taking (i.e., DOSPERT and YRBS).
People often encounter death-related stimuli that can remind them of their own mortality. Research shows that consumers who think about their mortality may cope with existential anxiety through various consumption behaviors. Across three studies, our work extends these findings and demonstrates that mortality salience (MS) increases people’s desire for experiential creation. The results showed that MS (versus control condition) increased consumers’ preferences for experiential creation products. This occurs because such experiential creation consumption increases consumers’ sense of personal agency, which can help them cope with MS. These findings enrich the literature on MS as well as experiential creation and provide important practical implications.
This study explored how emerging adults processed the COVID-19 pandemic based on their identity, mental well-being, and political ideology. Participants (N= 231;Mage= 20.3;SD= 1.36) completed an online survey with five ordered measures: Dimensions of Identity Development Scale, pandemic processing narratives, pandemic experience questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8, and political ideology and demographic questionnaire. Analyses revealed that individuals with poorer mental well-being and/or more liberal political ideology self-reported more negative effects of the pandemic on their lives. Yet, aspects of emerging adults’ identity development were associated with positive interpretation of experiences during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: Greater ‘exploration in breadth’ and ‘identification with commitment’ positively predicted redemptive arcs (finding the positive) in narratives about the pandemic. Finally, political ideology was an important factor in emerging adults’ experience of the pandemic. Notably, conservative participants self-reported better mental well-being, fewer negative effects of the pandemic, and higher levels of identity commitment. Yet, conservative participants with high levels of ‘commitment making’ were less likely to find the positive when writing about negative events. Whereas, greater ‘commitment making’reduced the likelihood of redemptive arcs when writing about a negative event, but only for those with a conservative political ideology. Together these results suggest that aspects of identity development may be protective when emerging adults face challenges and individual factors (e.g., well-being and political ideology) can also exert effects on emerging adults’ ability to navigate global and political crises.
In view of the neglect of previous studies on the relationship between how to provide feedback to students and how students should absorb feedback, this study constructed a multi-medium structural equation model and conducted a validation study on it. To this end, 704 senior high school students in China (45.31% male, 54.69% female, 43.47% in grade one, 28.69% in grade two, and 27.84% in grade three), were investigated by using students’ feedback literacy scale, perceived teachers’ emotion support questionnaire, critical reflection scale and cognitive reappraisal scale. The results showed that teachers’ emotion support can directly promote students’ feedback literacy, and can also indirectly promote students’ feedback literacy through cognitive reappraisal, critical reflection and their chain relationships. It is of great benefit for educators to construct and implement students’ feedback literacy intervention programs and improve feedback practice effect.

BackgroundA consistent link between self-forgiveness and well-being has been established, yet a full understanding of self-forgiveness and its correlates, particularly in relation to forgiveness by God, remains limited, especially given that most existing data are cross-sectional. This study sought to address this gap by investigating the interplay between self-forgiveness and perceived forgiveness by God in reducing stress overload among religious individuals over time.MethodsThis study involved 211 religious individuals in Canada, 55% of whom were female. Through multilevel analyses, the research examined the between-person, within-person, and cross-level effects of these forms of forgiveness on stress across three waves conducted over a total 12-month period.ResultsThe findings suggested that the effectiveness of self-forgiveness in mitigating stress may be significantly influenced by the perception of forgiveness by God, with the greatest stress reduction occurring when forgiveness by God was perceived at higher levels.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the potential value of incorporating spiritual dimensions into psychological approaches to stress management, offering insights into the complex relationships between different forms of forgiveness and their impact on mental health of religious individuals. Future research is encouraged to further explore these dynamics across diverse cultural and religious contexts.
The role of cultural heritage (CH) in sustainable tourism management (STM) goes beyond mere conservation; it is a dynamic process that involves actively integrating cultural richness into the tourism experience. This study, employing a quantitative research design with 447 tourists through online questionnaires, explores the intricate relationship between CH and STM, focusing on preserving identities and enhancing visitor experiences. The research introduces a novel aspect by emphasizing the favorable economic outcomes linked to destinations successfully incorporating CH into their tourism strategies. This insight is valuable for destination planners, emphasizing the economic benefits derived from CH initiatives. The key findings confirm significant and positive associations between the preservation of CH and STM, highlighting its substantial contribution to improved visitor experiences in sustainable tourism. Moreover, the study establishes a positive correlation between CH preservation and heightened visitor satisfaction in sustainable tourism. Effective STM emerges as a positive influence on the preservation of cultural identities, while destinations integrating CH into tourism strategies experience favorable economic impacts, reflected in increased tourist spending and local economic development. These findings offer valuable insights for future research, policymaking, and strategic planning in destinations seeking a harmonious balance between CH preservation and the advancement of tourism.
Currently, there is no validated German tool that captures the basic needs as outlined in Self-Determination Theory (SDT) in the organizational context. To be able to collect reliable and valid data for research and use the results of German research on SDT to derive and implement empirically grounded practical implications that foster employee well-being, performance, and companies’ growth, a validated measurement tool is a compulsory requirement. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate a German version of the Work-related Basic Need Satisfaction scale. (W-BNS). We replicated the three-factor structure, as well as the reliability of the three subscales and could extensively confirm the construct- and the criterion-related validity of the original W-BNS for the German version (W-BNS-G,N= 648). Additionally, multi-group comparisons were conducted to investigate cultural measurement invariance with the Dutch and the Italian version of the W-BNS. In summary, the present study provides a tool with high reliability and validity assessing the basic needin the organizational context in German language. We address the potential comparability of German, Italian, and Dutch findings using the different versions of the W-BNS and conclude by discussing the limitations of the present study and deriving suggestions for future research.
The research aims to reveal the moderating effect of wage and promotion opportunities and the mediating effect of motivation on the effect of job insecurity experienced by employees in the gig economy, which is the equivalent of the current labor market, on job satisfaction. In addition, it aims to reveal all configurations of job satisfaction. With the survey data obtained from sample of gig workers, the structural model was first tested with PLS-SEM and then the asymmetric analysis technique was conducted with FsQCA. According to the first-stage results, there was no direct and significant relationship between job insecurity and job satisfaction in the gig economy. However, the relationship becomes significant when the moderating variables wage and promotion opportunities, and the mediating variable motivation are included in the research model. In the second phase, a total of fifty-one configurations and potential models emerged, which included relevant variables in symmetric and asymmetric contexts.
In recent years, the focus on student safety and well-being has intensified within educational settings, driven by national crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and school shootings and rates of student mental health decline. School mental health professionals (SMHPs) such as school counselors and school social workers are resources that schools can use as a protective factor against these threats to student well-being. However, role-based stressors preventing SMHPs from being appropriately integrated into the current educational environment such as high caseloads, financial insecurity, and a divisive political environment have accumulated in parallel to these events. Unfortunately there has been little systematic research on understanding factors to prevent stress, such as coworker support. Thus, this study delves into the daily tasks and stressors experienced by SMHPs, aiming to elucidate their roles, investigate patterns of daily activities linked to higher stress, and explore the moderating effects of perceived coworker support on SMHP stress levels. The study involved 36 school counselors and social workers funded under Arizona's School Safety Program who completed brief ecological momentary assessments (EMA) twice a week, reflecting on their experiences over the preceding days, for a duration of up to four weeks (n= 285 daily logs). Findings using latent class analysis reveal three distinct profiles of SMHP activities with high activity days associated with higher levels of stress. Additionally, coworker support was not significantly different between different profiles of days. Future research should include tasks outside the responsibilities of SMHPs, such as administrative tasks, to account for the growing body of research indicating these as additional SMHP stressors, as well as explore systemic factors that may contribute to these results.
In spite of the proliferation of research studies on vocabulary knowledge, investigating the relationship between self-regulation, vocabulary size, and collocational knowledge among English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners has received scant attention. The current study aimed to investigate whether vocabulary and collocation size can explain EFL learners’ self-regulated vocabulary learning. A population of 271 EFL learners from three state universities located in Iran participated in taking lexical measures (VST, Lex30, and a collocation test) and filling a questionnaire (SRCvoc). To check the relationship between self-regulated vocabulary learning, vocabulary and collocation size, standard multiple regression was conducted with SPSS. The results of standard multiple regression analysis showed that EFL learners’ vocabulary and collocation size could explain a significant portion of the variance in the score of their self-regulation in vocabulary learning. The findings also indicated that verb-noun collocation size and productive vocabulary size were significant predictors of EFL learners’ self-regulated capacity in vocabulary learning. Finally, implications and suggestions for future research are offered.
Humans share with many animal species the ability to perceive and approximately represent the number of objects in visual scenes. This ability improves throughout childhood, suggesting that learning and development play a key role in shaping our number sense. This hypothesis is further supported by computational investigations based on deep learning, which have shown that numerosity perception can spontaneously emerge in neural networks that learn the statistical structure of images with a varying number of items. However, neural network models are usually trained using synthetic datasets that might not faithfully reflect the statistical structure of natural environments, and there is also growing interest in using more ecological visual stimuli to investigate numerosity perception in humans. In this work, we exploit recent advances in computer vision algorithms to design and implement an original pipeline that can be used to estimate the distribution of numerosity and non-numerical magnitudes in large-scale datasets containing thousands of real images depicting objects in daily life situations. We show that in natural visual scenes the frequency of appearance of different numerosities follows a power law distribution. Moreover, we show that the correlational structure for numerosity and continuous magnitudes is stable across datasets and scene types (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous object sets). We suggest that considering such “ecological” pattern of covariance is important to understand the influence of non-numerical visual cues on numerosity judgements.
Frontline medical workers (FMWs) faced high stress levels in frontline clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to alleviate FMWs’ psychological stress by enhancing protection measures, which includes refining the selection process, improving protective measures for their work in frontline clinics, and determining the appropriate time for evacuation. A Chinese-language-version stress questionnaire, covering stress-related issues and sociodemographic characteristics, was administered to FMWs in Shanghai during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022, yielding 107 valid responses. The questionnaire’s reliability and validity were subsequently confirmed. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was applied to the stress-related questions, with the KMO and Bartlett’s test values of 0.886, 877.8522 (df = 120,p< 0.0001), respectively. Structure equation modeling (SEM) was used to confirm the factors and measure the relationships among the stress-related questions, factors and sociodemographic characteristics. The parameters of SEM named SOFAIDC were significant with SRMSR, RMSEA, AGFI, NFI, and PNFI being 0.0422, 0.0507, 0.9946, 0.9958, and 0.7615, respectively. Paired sample t-tests revealed the significant decrease in FMWs’ stress score of the current week and the previous week, with all t-values being negative and significant (p< 0.01). A latent growth model (LGM) named LGM30 verified the overall decreasing stress trend over the weeks, with high R-squares (> 0.80), significant positive linear and negative quadratic time parameters. Based on the trajectory analysis, a stress scorecard with an AUC of 0.856 was developed. This study found that there are four factors for FMWs’ psychological stress (anxiety about infection, exhaustion, lack of cognition for infection, and hesitant feeling), and improving targeted hospital protection could alleviate FMWs’ psychological stress through SOFAIDC, as all the total effect of factors or items from the feeling of being protected by hospital were negative. Meanwhile, although overall FMWs’ stress trend has decreased, 22.43% of FMWs have maintained or experienced a high stress trend, and the stress might increase over weeks in frontline clinics. To perfect hospital protection to alleviate FMWs’ psychological stress, the scorecard could be used to select FMWs with low-stress trends, LGM30 could be used to determine the withdrawal time (such as week 8), and targeted hospital protections could be designed based on the relationships between feeling of being protected by the hospital and factors in SOFAIDC, such as providing adequate protective equipment, improving the rationality of FMWs’ work schedules, recruiting personnel with higher education levels, and paying adequate monetary compensation.
Survivors of attempted suicide are often shamed and silenced with respect to their lived experiences, especially in certain societies where such behaviour is seen as taboo. Despite the phenomenon of suicide being recognised as deeply rooted in cultural narratives, limited qualitative work has focused on the experience from a subjective viewpoint and a phenomenological lens. Through this paper, I seek to provide a qualitative analysis of surviving a suicide attempt in the Indian context, using an autoethnographic approach to explore the emotional, psychological, and cultural aftermath of such experiences. The study addresses the lack of reflective research on suicide survivors in India, and focuses on the socio-cultural narratives, healthcare system interactions, and cultural expectations that shape survivors’ experiences and recovery. Some of the themes that emerged from the data analysed included “missing early warning signs- the shift from passive to active suicidal ideation”, “relief or despair on surviving? reactions of professionals and the hospital staff”, “ignorance of the experience of survival- the role played by social stigma”, and “desire to seek psychological first aid and barriers to the same”. These themes are academically analysed in the context of existing cultural narratives and normative practices, thus highlighting the role of social contexts in such experiences. The paper aims to shed light on an important phenomenon and experience that is often ignored, and argues that cross-cultural research is an essential aspect of fully grasping personal experiences, like this one. The study has implications for mental health practitioners in terms of better assisting survivors of attempted suicide, via taking into account their cultural realities and settings as a part of the experiential and healing process.
The aim of the study was to investigate the role of professional identity as a moderator in the relationship between the teachers’ collective responsibilities and the school improvement perspective. Data were collected from 922 teachers employed at primary, secondary, and high schools in Türkiye and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the potential structural linkages among professional identity, collective responsibility, and perspectives on school improvement. The results demonstrated that teachers’ collective responsibility was associated with their perceptions of the school improvement and components that need to be improved. The study determined the significant role of collective responsibility on teachers’ school improvement perceptions and the significant moderator role of teacher professional identity in the relationship. Focusing on testing the relationship among collective responsibility, perspectives of school improvement, and teachers’ professional identity, this study how countries with high differences between schools in international exams can improve the differences. School leaders should support teachers to join in board meetings of school. This can help with school improvement practices.
Self-compassion, which is effective in reducing burnout, may be important for aid workers because it could potentially weaken the connection of automatic thoughts and rumination with burnout. However, the effect of self-compassion in the association of automatic thoughts and rumination with burnout among nursing students has not been examined. Therefore, in this study, we examined the moderating effect of self-compassion in the association of automatic thoughts and rumination with burnout. In this longitudinal study, 72 second-year students attending a Japanese nursing college completed a two-wave panel survey. The data were analyzed using correlation analysis and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The results revealed a moderating effect of self-compassion in the relationship between rumination and burnout; however, the moderating effect of self-compassion in the relationship between automatic thoughts and burnout was limited. The results can contribute to the development of an intervention program that cultivates self-compassion and prevents burnout and turnover among nursing students.
Assisting children with homework can be a major stressor in Chinese parents’ lives. Drawing upon the Family Stress Model (FSM), our study examines the indirect effects of parental homework stress on children’s academic functioning, as well as the moderating effect of family socioeconomic status (SES). A pilot study is first conducted to develop and test a parental homework involvement style scale to capture the characteristics of supportive and controlling parental homework involvement in Chinese culture. In the main study, a total of 291 parent-child dyads participated in our survey. The results showed that parental homework stress is linked to negative aspects of children’s academic functioning through the chain mediation of lower levels of coparental support and supportive homework involvement. Multiple group path analysis revealed that, however, in low-income families, parental homework stress undermines children’s academic functioning through both reduced supportive involvement and increased controlling involvement, whereas in high-income families, this impact is channeled solely by the chain mediation of decreased coparental support and supportive involvement. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the parental homework stress process by applying the FSM to the homework context for the first time. It also adds to the homework involvement literature in exploring the potential antecedents of homework involvement styles.
With increasing literature refuting the role of situational antecedents as reliably distinguishing the elicitation of shame, guilt and remorse, there arises a need to examine the underlying dispositional factors at play. Although personality factors like neuroticism and extraversion have often been analyzed along with positive–negative affect, other personality factors and their relation to the complex moral emotions have rarely been studied. A study was conducted on 147 participants to examine the role of big-five personality factors namely, neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience and agreeableness on the three complex moral emotions. Storyboards depicting 13 scenarios were used as stimuli for measuring shame, guilt and remorse. Results enumerate that while openness to experience has the ability to distinguish between guilt and shame, neuroticism and extraversion are significant positive predictors of guilt. Overall findings suggest the interplay of personality and moral emotions and highlights the need to study these emotions in larger and varied contexts.
Most work on indicators of vocal confidence (and social influence work more broadly) examines linear relationships between variables. However, in some domains curvilinear (i.e., accelerating or decelerating) relationships may provide greater clarity in understanding human speech patterns. We review mixed past work on vocal speed as a case study, wherein faster vocal speed has been shown both to bolster and inhibit persuasion (e.g., by impairing processing). Across six total studies (Ntotal= 3,958), we show that faster speed initially increases perceived source confidence and message processing but eventually the increase attenuates or reverses. Correspondingly, vocal speed has a decelerating relationship to participants’ processing of persuasive messages, as revealed by two main processes: argument quality effects on attitudes, and the correspondence between thought valence and attitudes. The present work highlights the potential value of high-powered examinations of curvilinear relationships in non-verbal phenomenon for which speed is likely to play a role.
The paper reports comparative results of six stigmatized groups' perceptions of marginalization, exclusion, ritualistic inclusion, and dehumanization (i.e. humiliation, atrocity, and exploitation). A total of 328 participants belonging to 6 different stigmatized groups rated their experiences on questionnaires developed to measure perceived economic condition and stigmatization experiences tapped through perceived exclusion-ritualistic inclusion, dehumanization, personal and social identity. Along with these, attribution, coping, self-esteem and health were also measured. The findings revealed that all the stigmatized groups significantly differed on various dimensions i.e. stigmatization, exclusion, ritualistic inclusion and dehumanization, self- esteem, identity, and health. The transgender and beggars are among the most stigmatized and vulnerable. The perceived economic condition of beggars, downtrodden, and transgender was the lowest compared to other groups in the study and they also reported poor psychological and physical health. It was observed that both the transgenders and beggars perceived higher levels of ritualistic inclusion; however, they also reported significantly higher experiences of dehumanization. The downtrodden group is among the most economically oppressed where the perceived poverty is the highest, they report greater atrocities, their psychological health and physical health condition is also inadequate. Other groups like the differently-abled (previously termed disabled) and widowed women perceived their economic condition as stable and also reported fewer issues of physical and psychological health in comparison to other groups. Their perceptions of exclusion were comparable to the downtrodden and differently-abled, with lowest mean values for ritualistic inclusion. With respect to the dimensions of dehumanization, the disabled, leprosy patients, and widows perceived the least humiliation, atrocity and exploitation. Individually each group presents unique variations. The study highlights the issue of stigmatization and its implications for health and well-being.
Whether conscious awareness is critical for detecting semantic information in individual words remains debated. We hypothesize that this issue is specific to language type and that orthography serves as a mediator between semantics and conscious awareness. Using a priming-based paradigm called breaking continuous flash suppression (b-CFS) with a full factorial design, this study investigated whether orthographic similarity and semantic relatedness between the prime and target could modulate conscious access to Chinese single characters. Statistics indicated that semantic relatedness did not facilitate the character’s breakthrough from CFS unless combined with orthographic similarity, although orthographic similarity alone had an inhibitory effect. The results were discussed in light of the “unconscious binding” hypothesis and object-updating theory in visual perception as well as the unique sub-morphemic construction in psycholinguistics. Our findings demonstrate the possibility of orthography-based semantic processing occurring outside of conscious awareness and suggest that the multilevel interaction activation model may be applicable to the early recognition of Chinese characters.
IntroductionCommunity-controlled organisations provide crucial services to support the health and wellbeing of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and gender diverse, intersex, queer and other sexual and/or gender minority (LGBTIQ +) people. A strength of such organisations and their practitioners (many of whom are LGBTIQ +) is their cultural expertise, which can help to identify, understand and address the specific needs of LGBTIQ + clients, including in relation to family violence. While much discussion about standards of care for LGBTIQ + people has focused on a need for mainstream service providers and their non-LGBTIQ + practitioners to become more “culturally competent”, less has considered how clients experience services at community-controlled organisations.MethodsIn this article, we draw on 19 semi-structured interviews with clients of family violence services at an LGBTIQ + community-controlled organisation in Melbourne, Australia, to explore their perceptions of specialist LGBTIQ + services. Eleven participants were cisgender men, six were cisgender women and two were trans or gender diverse. In terms of sexual orientation, ten self-described as gay, one homosexual, two queer, three lesbian, one bisexual, one asexual and one preferred not to say. Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns of service experience.ResultsOur research shows that participants felt that specialist services were most effective when they were informed about, affirming of and focused on the identities and specific health needs of LGBTIQ + clients. Participants had experienced what they perceived to be effective services within the context of LGBTIQ + community-controlled organisations, though felt that “mainstream” service providers were also potentially capable of providing good-quality support. A concerted effort on the part of these providers to embed culturally competent and LGBTIQ + -friendly practices into their services would help them achieve this outcome.ConclusionsSpecialist support was most visible in the context of LGBTIQ + community-controlled organisations but also possible in other health and wellbeing settings, which is promising for mainstream service providers and practitioners seeking to provide more inclusive care for LGBTIQ + people.Policy ImplicationsThe insight of clients in this research is something that can potentially contribute to further discussion about the continued work both of LGBTIQ + community-controlled organisations and mainstream services.
Inhibitory control refers to the ability to suppress a pre-potent response. Studies investigating the role of emotional information in inhibitory control have yielded conflicting results. Some studies have shown that positive emotion, compared to negative, facilitates inhibitory control, while other studies have shown opposite effects. We propose a resolution to this debate by positing that the scope of attention with which emotional information is processed could elucidate these mixed outcomes. A larger scope of attention (global scope of attention) has been linked to positive emotions, and a narrow scope of attention (local scope of attention) has been linked to negative emotions. We combined a stop-signal task with a global–local Navon task. Participants were tasked with detecting a target presented within either a global or local scope of attention (letters H, S, and T). Occasionally, they encountered a stop-signal with irrelevant angry, happy, or neutral facial expressions. Results showed that under a global scope of attention, happy facial expressions impaired inhibitory control compared to angry expressions; conversely, under a local scope of attention, happy faces facilitated inhibitory control relative to angry faces. Notably, predisposition toward a local or global attentional scope, as measured by a separate global–local disposition task, did not modulate these effects. We replicated our results in Experiment 2 using hierarchical stimuli made up of digits (6, 9, and 8) and controlling for other task-specific variables. Collectively, our findings emphasize the pivotal role of scope of attention in determining the impact of emotional information on cognitive processes, specifically inhibitory control.
While recent research has advanced our understanding of asexuality, very little effort has been devoted to examining biomarkers and possible prenatal correlates of asexuality. In response, we recruited a large international sample (N= 1634 women and men) to explore associations between sibling composition and asexual sexual orientation (n= 366) and to replicate previously reported sibship effects in individuals with a same-sex attracted orientation (n= 276) and bisexual sexual orientation (n= 267) compared to heterosexual individuals (n= 725). Our analyses used two of the most recent statistical approaches that attempt to disentangle older sibling effects from family size effects (Ablaza et al., 2022; Khovanova, 2020). We found that higher overall number of siblings (female fecundity effect) predicted higher probability of asexuality in men and having fewer older sisters and being an only-child predicted higher probability of asexuality in women. Regarding the same-sex attracted orientations, higher number of older sisters increased likelihood of being a gay man (sororal birth order effect). Having fewer older sisters was associated with bisexual sexual orientation in women and higher overall number of siblings predicted increased likelihood of bisexuality in men. We did not find a fraternal birth order effect for gay, lesbian, bisexual or asexual groups using the Ablaza et al. (2022) method but the effect was significant for gay men using the Khovanova (2020) analytic approach. These findings point to potential sibship-related contribution to development of asexuality in women and men but future studies will need to replicate these results and articulate potential underlying mechanisms.
This contribution begins from Winnicott’s introduction of the incommunicado self in his paper on communication to suggest that interiority and the psyche come to constitute the infantile world through the earliest environment and through solitude. The capacity to be with others and to be alone originate in an earlier state where communication both makes no sense and yet contains the origin of the life source through the baby’s bodily experience of self and world. The world beyond the baby enables this through an other’s care. I link this with Bion’s position on loneliness and his recognition that people may choose to live in contact with the unsynthesized and incoherent. Encouraging the unsynthesized, the formless, and the inexpressible in our patients offers ways of being an analyst that for me is the legacy of Winnicott and Bion.
The relationship between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and screen time (ST) has been extensively studied; but the evidence remains inconsistent, and a comprehensive quantitative synthesis of this association is lacking. This study aims to provide a robust quantitative assessment of the relationship between ASD and ST by consolidating and analyzing available evidence to offer a more precise understanding of this complex association. This systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 statement, and applied a quality assessment tool for quantitative studies to identity best available evidence. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus, covering literature published from January 1, 2006 to June 12, 2024. In total, 30 studies involving 356,666 participants met the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed a significant association between screen exposure in preschool children and the development of ASD, with a longer duration of screen exposure correlating with an increased likelihood of being diagnosed with autism. Furthermore, autistic people tend to have longer daily screen use and are at a higher risk of screen addiction compared to non-autistic individuals. These findings emphasize the importance of limiting ST for preschoolers and autistic people. However, the level of evidence supporting these conclusions is very low. Future studies should focus on controlling for confounding factors, using more objective measures, and further investigate the relationship between screen engagement styles (active or passive), screen use patterns (screen devices and content), and ASD.
Differences in the perceptions of illness between patients and caregivers are associated with negative health-related outcomes. However, little is known about the correlates of divergent perceptions of ADHD among diagnosed adolescents and their parents. This study applied the Common-Sense Model of Illness Representations (CSM) to examine how parent perceptions of ADHD, including divergent parent-adolescent perceptions, relate to coping, quality of life (QoL), and treatment adherence, among adolescents with ADHD. Participants were 63 adolescents diagnosed with ADHD (10–18 years, 79.3% male, mean age = 14.28,SD= 2.07) and their parents (78.8% mothers), recruited from clinics and support services. Self-report measures were completed by adolescents and parents in isolation from one another. Results from a series of hierarchical regressions indicated that adolescents held less pessimistic views of the disorder and believed it was less biologically based than did parents. Divergent parent-adolescent perceptions regardingtimelineandcauseswere significantly related to adolescent coping and QoL. Adolescents’ expectation of a shorter duration of ADHD was associated with reduced active coping. Their stronger attribution to insufficient efforts was associated with lower QoL. Although adolescents with a stronger belief in psychosocial causes exhibited poorer active coping and QoL, they exhibited greater active coping when their parents endorsed this belief. Taken together, these findings identify beneficial and detrimental beliefs about ADHD for both diagnosed adolescents and their parents. The results underscore the potential importance of beliefs about psychosocial causes to coping and well-being, as well as the importance of divergent parent-adolescent perceptions.
In the context of the reform of the economic system and the globalization of the economy, in order to explore the effect of secure base leadership on positive followership behavior. This study constructed a conceptual model of Secure Base Leadership and Positive Followership Behaviour based on Cognitive Affective Systems Theory. The chain mediating role of organisation-based self-esteem and work dynamics and the moderating role of equity sensitivity as a moderator of the relationship between secure base leadership and organisation-based self-esteem/work dynamics were examined. In total, 2 studies were conducted: study 1 was a situational experiment with 120 MBA students, which showed that secure base leaders can positively influence organisation-based self-esteem and work dynamics. To further explore this finding, Study 2 was a three-time point questionnaire survey on 366 employees in different industries, accounting for 84.14%, and the results of Study 2 not only proved the findings of Study 1, but also demonstrated that secure base leaders significantly influence positive followership behaviours. At the same time, organisation-based self-esteem and work dynamics were found to play a mediating role between secure base leadership and positive followership behaviour. In addition, equity sensitivity negatively moderated the relationship between secure base leadership and organisation-based self-esteem/work dynamism and also negatively moderated the indirect effect of secure base leadership influencing positive following behaviour through organisation-based self-esteem/work dynamism. Based on the findings, this study presents the theoretical contributions and managerial implications of this study and provides an outlook for future research.
Quigley and colleagues described a treatment recommendation scenario within a multi-disciplinary team setting for an adult with a developmental disability. The authors presented the information in a standard format to share how the involved parties identified, evaluated, and responded to the recommendation based upon their understanding of ethical decision-making. This commentary highlights a number of important strengths that played a key  role in the successful resolution of the challenge discussed by Quigley and colleagues. It further highlights some of the reasons clients may be drawn to non-evidence-based interventions and cautions behavior analysts to approach such situations with care. Though behavior analysts should not themselves provide non-evidence-based interventions, inordinate pressure on clients to avoid such interventions may constitute a form of coercion and may undermine clients’ trust in behavior analysts.
In many scientific fields, sparseness and indirectness of empirical evidence pose fundamental challenges to theory development. Theories of the evolution of human cognition provide a guiding example, where the targets of study are evolutionary processes that occurred in the ancestors of present-day humans. In many cases, the evidence is both very sparse and very indirect (e.g., archaeological findings regarding anatomical changes that might be related to the evolution of language capabilities); in other cases, the evidence is less sparse but still very indirect (e.g., data on cultural transmission in groups of contemporary humans and non-human primates). From examples of theoretical and empirical work in this domain, we distill five virtuous practices that scientists could aim to satisfy when evidence is sparse or indirect: (i) making assumptions explicit, (ii) making alternative theories explicit, (iii) pursuing computational and formal modelling, (iv) seeking external consistency with theories of related phenomena, and (v) triangulating across different forms and sources of evidence. Thus, rather than inhibiting theory development, sparseness or indirectness of evidence can catalyze it. To the extent that there are continua of sparseness and indirectness that vary across domains and that the principles identified here always apply to some degree, the solutions and advantages proposed here may generalise to other scientific domains.
Considering the urgent need to tackle mental health challenges related to forced migration, our exploratory quantitative study aimed to investigate the relationship between subjective well-being (SWB), sense of coherence (SOC), trauma and psychopathological symptoms on the mental health of African forced migrants in Niger. We also explored the association of gender, age, ethnicity, and displacement status with SWB, SOC, psychological symptoms, and psychological distress in this population. The study included 410 African forcibly displaced adults (M = 38.10, SD = ± 14.56). Participants were assessed using the WHO-5 for subjective well-being, GHQ-12 for psychological distress, SOC_3 for the sense of coherence, and IES and SCL-27 for traumatic and psychopathological symptomatology, respectively. Our findings indicated significant gender differences in GHQ-12 scores, with females scoring higher and exhibiting higher levels of anxiety, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. MANOVA revealed significant differences in age, status, and ethnicity. Younger individuals showed higher total symptomatology, while refugees had higher levels of subjective well-being and sense of coherence, but also higher levels of depression and paranoia. Different ethnicities exhibited diverse symptom profiles. Furthermore, the multiple regression analysis highlighted that subjective well-being and sense of coherence had a negative effect on mental health, whereas trauma and psychopathology had a positive effect. Additionally, anxiety and trauma were positively correlated with mental distress. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing the mental health needs of displaced populations. Targeted interventions and further research are essential to address the complex issues surrounding mental health among forced migrants. Moreover, a comprehensive approach to studying and intervening on mental health issues in this vulnerable population is strongly emphasized.
Objectives: This randomized controlled trial evaluates a single-session Mindfulness Self-Compassion (MSC) intervention for enhancing interoceptive awareness (AI) and alleviating anxiety and reducing pain in Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) patients. The study also examines the intervention’s feasibility and the mediating role of IA in improving clinical outcomes, incorporating nature visuals to address treatment accessibility and adherence. Methods/analysis: Sixty-four FMS patients were randomized into three groups: MSC with audio-only, MSC with audio and nature visuals, or a waitlist control. Validated scales measured interoceptive awareness, anxiety, and pain pre- and post-intervention. ANOVA examined primary outcomes, and mediation analysis explored interoceptive awareness as a mediator. A 7-minute intervention duration was chosen for its balance of effectiveness and feasibility, with nature visuals selected for their calming effects. Findings: Both MSC groups showed significant improvements in IA, anxiety, and pain compared to the control group, with the audio-visual group showing the strongest effects. Enhanced interoceptive awareness significantly mediated anxiety reduction but not pain relief. Nature visuals further reduced anxiety and pain compared to audio-only. Novelty/improvement: This study validates the efficacy of a single-session MSC intervention for FMS, highlighting IA as a crucial mediator of anxiety improvement. Incorporating sensory-rich visual elements enhances therapeutic effects, offering a promising approach for MSC interventions in clinical settings. Future research should explore long-term benefits and optimal dosage of this innovative intervention, addressing the need for accessible, cost-effective FMS treatments.
The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of childhood trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder, and trauma-related comorbid diagnoses on the risk for readmission to juvenile detention among youth in a large metropolitan area (N = 1282). The following research questions were addressed: 1) Does a greater number of childhood traumas increase the risk for readmission to detention following release? 2) Does the risk for readmission differ by type of trauma? 3) Do PTSD and other co-morbid diagnoses increase the risk for readmission? and 4) What role do demographic factors play in the relationship between trauma-related variables and risk for readmission? This study utilized the screening results of 1282 youth who were voluntarily screened for PTSD, depressive symptoms and substance use during their initial intake to detention. More than half of the sample was readmitted during the three-year study period, with readmissions most likely to occur within one year of release. Returning to detention within one year was also associated with increased risk for multiple readmissions. Youth readmitted to detention were more likely to have a history of sexual abuse and problematic substance use. No other significant relationships were found between risk for readmission and trauma-related variables. Although trauma-related symptoms may be crucial targets for treatment, focusing solely on trauma exposure and traumatic stress symptoms without considering the impact of other risk factors may not be enough to decrease the likelihood of readmission for youth of color in a large urban environment.
