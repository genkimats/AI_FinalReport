A search for the very rare\(B^{*0}\rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-\)and\(B_{s}^{*0}\rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-\)decays is conducted by analysing the\(B_c^+\rightarrow \pi ^+\mu ^+\mu ^-\)process. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data collected with the LHCb detector between 2011 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9\(\text {\,fb}^{-1}\). The signal signatures correspond to simultaneous peaks in the\(\mu ^+\mu ^-\)and\(\pi ^+\mu ^+\mu ^-\)invariant masses. No evidence for an excess of events over background is observed for either signal decay mode. Upper limits at the\(90\%\)confidence level are set on the branching fractions relative to that for\(B_c^+\rightarrow J\hspace{-1.66656pt}/\hspace{-1.111pt}\psi \pi ^+\)decays,$$\begin{aligned} \mathcal{R}_{B^{*0}(\mu ^+\mu ^-)\pi ^+/J\hspace{-1.66656pt}/\hspace{-1.111pt}\psi \pi ^+}&< 3.8\times 10^{-5}\ \text { and }\\ \mathcal{R}_{B_{s}^{*0}(\mu ^+\mu ^-)\pi ^+/J\hspace{-1.66656pt}/\hspace{-1.111pt}\psi \pi ^+}&< 5.0\times 10^{-5}. \end{aligned}$$
There were at least seven attempts to calculate critical radii for reactors or bombs 1939–1945. Those made by Flügge and Peierls in 1939 are compared with the calculations made by Perrin (1939), Heisenberg (1939 and 1945) and Serber (1943). Fermi’s 1942 reactor calculations are not covered here because that would call for a separate paper. Heisenberg calculated the critical radius formula and some critical radii in 1939 for a reactor. He focused on reactors 1939–45 and apparently did not make a bomb calculation before his August 1945 Farm Hall Lecture where he independently reproduced the 1943 Los Alamos Primer calculation for a bomb to within the limits that he knew the fast fission cross section. Flügge attempted a ponderous alternative to a critical radius calculation. Perrin’s calculation predates the Heisenberg and Serber calculations. His theoretical choice of tamper boundary condition was not optimal but his calculation method was correct. Peierls aimed to improve on Perrin's method but did worse. Finally, we calculate the 2.1 cm critical radius stated in the Frisch–Peierls Memorandum from Peierls’ model and graph, and we also show how Frisch and Peierls likely calculated it, including why Frisch assumed a fission cross section of 10 barn in his calculation.
The widely accepted accretion scenario of planet formation suggests that the Moon experienced a violent bombardment in its early history. The accretion scenario predicts that a total of ~300 basins with sizes greater than 300 km formed throughout its bombardment history; however, only ~40 basins of this size are identified on the Moon. The cause for this notable discrepancy is unknown. Here we investigate the viscous relaxation of impact basins formed within ~150 Myr after the completion of lunar magma ocean (LMO) solidification, as only impacts that happened afterwards could be retained by the crust. We find that, owing to the high temperature of the lower crust, basins formed within ~100 Myr after the LMO solidification could have been sufficiently relaxed by lower crustal inflow to escape detection in gravitational and topographic data. By contrast, basins formed afterwards should have limited relaxation, as the cooler temperature of the lower crust inhibits the inflow. Our results show that, to have ~40 retained basins, the Moon would have had ~300–1,000 basin-forming impacts throughout its history and the LMO would have solidified ~4.3 Gyr ago. The temperature-dependent viscous relaxation of post-LMO basins provides a realistic explanation for the low number of basins observed on the Moon. The substantial relaxation of early basins suggests that terrestrial planets, which experienced crustal cooling after magma ocean solidification, may have suffered far more impacts than the basin records indicate.
In this paper, we have put forwarded a detailed investigation on the cosmic evolution of Bianchi type III model within the realm of Born-Infeldf(R) gravity executing the Palatini approach. Using a very eminent tool known as Dynamical System Approach (DSA), we have curtailed the complexity of the non linear field equations and study the dynamics for the form\(f(R) =R-\beta / R^n\). The main focus of our work is to retrieve the sequence of cosmic evolution and to study the evolution of shear as well as spatial curvature.
This article focuses on different anisotropic models within the framework of a specific modified\(f(\mathcal {R},\mathcal {T}, \mathcal {R}_{\zeta \gamma }\mathcal {T}^{\zeta \gamma })\)gravity theory. The study adopts a static spherically symmetric spacetime to determine the field equations for two different modified models: (i)\(f(\mathcal {R},\mathcal {T},\mathcal {R}_{\zeta \gamma }\mathcal {T}^{\zeta \gamma })=\mathcal {R}+\eta \mathcal {R}_{\zeta \gamma }\mathcal {T}^{\zeta \gamma }\), and (ii)\(f(\mathcal {R},\mathcal {T},\mathcal {R}_{\zeta \gamma }\mathcal {T}^{\zeta \gamma })=\mathcal {R}(1+\eta \mathcal {R}_{\zeta \gamma }\mathcal {T}^{\zeta \gamma })\), where\(\eta \)is a constant parameter. To address the additional degrees of freedom in the field equations and obtain their corresponding unique solution, the Durgapal-Fuloria spacetime geometry and MIT bag model are utilized. Matching conditions are applied to determine unknown constants within the chosen spacetime geometry. We adopt a certain range of model parameters to analyze the physical characteristics of the developed models in the interior distribution of a particular compact star candidate 4U 1820-30. Energy conditions and some other tests are also implemented to ensure their viability and stability. Additionally, the disappearing radial pressure constraint is employed to find the values of the model parameter, aligning with the observed information of an array of stars. The study concludes that both of our models are well-behaved and satisfy all necessary conditions, and thus we observe them suitable for the modeling of astrophysical objects.
The SNO\(+\)collaboration reports its first spectral analysis of long-baseline reactor antineutrino oscillation using 114 tonne-years of data. Fitting the neutrino oscillation probability to the observed energy spectrum yields constraints on the neutrino mass-squared difference\(\Delta m^2_{21}\). In the ranges allowed by previous measurements, the best-fit\(\Delta m^2_{21}\)is (\(8.85^{+1.10}_{-1.33}\))\(\times \)\(10^{-5}\)\(\hbox {eV}^2\). This measurement is continuing in the next phases of SNO+ and is expected to surpass the present global precision on\(\Delta m^2_{21}\)with about three years of data.
This study deals with the new class of embedded wormhole solutions in the background of general relativity. Two newly calculated wormhole solutions satisfy  all the required properties. The embedded diagrams for both calculated wormhole solutions are provided. All the energy conditions are discussed through their validity regions for the different ranges of involved parameters. In maximum regions, all energy conditions are violated. We investigate the shadow and strong gravitational lensing by the wormhole throat for the two new wormhole models, namely Model-I and Model-II. The present paper considers the wormhole throat to act as a photon sphere. We first derive null geodesics using the Hamilton-Jacobi separation method to investigate the shadow and strong gravitational lensing caused by the wormhole throat. We then numerically obtain the radius of wormhole shadow, strong deflection angle, and various lensing observables by taking the example of supermassive black M87* and Sgr A* in the context of both Model-I and Model-II. Keeping all other parameters fixed, it is observed that the parameters\(\zeta _1\)and\(\zeta _2\)for Model-I; and\(\chi _1\)and\(\chi _2\)for Model-II have significant effects on the wormhole shadow and strong gravitational lensing phenomena. Our conclusion is that it is possible to detect relativistic images, such as Einstein rings, produced by wormholes with throat radii of\(r_{th}=3M\). The stability analysis via Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkov equation is included for both wormhole solutions. Additionally, current technology enables us to test hypotheses related to astrophysical wormholes.
We study the dynamics of a charged radiating star in general relativity. The junction conditions at the surface of the star lead to a restriction that connects the radial pressure to the heat flux. The master equation reduces to a nonlinear second order differential equation which determines the temporal evolution. The dynamical behaviour is studied via a phase plane analysis which reveals interesting behaviour. The presence of both the electromagnetic field and the cosmological constant are included in our treatment. They affect the temporal evolution of the gravitating star. We identify the restrictions on the parameters that lead to a stable asymptotic end state of the star.
The dynamic properties of molecular clouds are set by the interplay of their self-gravity, turbulence, external pressure and magnetic fields. Extended surveys of Galactic molecular clouds typically find that their kinetic energy (Ek) counterbalances their self-gravitational energy (Eg), setting their virial parameterαvir= 2Ek/∣Eg∣≈ 1. However, past studies either have been biased by the use of optically thick lines or have been limited within the solar neighbourhood and the inner Galaxy (Galactocentric radiusRgc<Rgc,⊙≈ 8 kpc). Here we present sensitive mapping observations of optically thin13CO lines towards molecular clouds in the low-metallicity Galactic outer disk (Rgc~ 9–24 kpc). By combining archival data from the inner Galaxy and four nearby metal-poor dwarf galaxies, we reveal a systematic trend ofαvir, which declines from supervirial dynamic states in metal-rich clouds to extremely subvirial dynamic states in metal-poor clouds. In these metal-poor environments, turbulence alone is insufficient to counterbalance the self-gravity of a cloud. A cloud-volumetric magnetic field may replace turbulence as the dominant cloud-supporting mechanism in low-metallicity conditions, for example, the outermost galactic disks, dwarf galaxies and galaxies in the early Universe, which would then inevitably impact the initial conditions for star formation in such environments.
We determine the uncorrelated modes that characterize the fluctuations in a semi-realistic model for the initial state of high-energy nuclear collisions, consisting of hot spots whose positions are distributed independently. Varying the number of hot spots, their size, and the weights with which they contribute to the initial state, we find that the parameter that has the largest influence on the relative importance of the fluctuation modes is the source size, with more extended hot spots leading to a more marked predominance of the principal modes.
In this paper, the light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the\(\rho \)meson are evaluated in the framework of the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model using the proper time regularization scheme. The transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) of the\(\rho \)meson are derived from the overlap representations of the LFWFs. We investigate the\(\varvec{k}_{\perp }\)-weighted moments and thex-dependent average transverse momentum\(\langle k_{\perp }^n(x)\rangle _{\alpha }\)of\(\rho \)meson TMDs. The\(\langle k_{\perp }^n(x)\rangle _{\alpha }\)shows the typical transverse momenta of quark TMDs in our model. Our findings indicate that the average transverse momenta of\(\langle k_{\perp }(x)\rangle _{\alpha }\)fall within the range of [0.3, 0.45] GeV, while\(\langle k_{\perp }^2(x)\rangle _{\alpha }\)are in the region of [0.15, 0.30]\(GeV^2\). Our TMDs and parton distribution functions (PDFs) exhibit excellent adherence to positive constraints. The investigation of spin densities within the\(\rho \)meson in transverse momentum space reveals axially symmetric distributions for quarks and targets polarized in either the longitudinal or transverse direction. Conversely, unpolarized symmetric distributions occur when the quark is longitudinally polarized and the target is transversely polarized, while exhibiting dipolar distortions in the opposite scenario. A comparison between TMDs from LFWFs and those from a covariant approach demonstrates that TMDs from LFWFs more effectively satisfy positive constraints than their counterparts from the covariant approach. Furthermore, thex-moments of\(\rho \)meson PDFs indicate that\(\langle x\rangle _{g_L}\)is larger using LFWFs than with the covariant approach. Additionally, analysis of quark spin densities within the\(\rho \)meson reveals that\(\rho _{\uparrow \downarrow }\left( k_x,k_y\right) =f-g_L-\frac{1}{3}f_{LL}\)yields a negative result using the covariant approach, whereas\(\rho _{\uparrow \downarrow }\left( k_x,k_y\right) \)derived from LFWFs produces a positive outcome.
The very high luminosity run foreseen at theZ-pole for the FCC-ee will allow the detection inZdecays of new particles  with very low couplings to the Standard Model. These particles can have measurable flight paths before they decay. If the timing and the position of the decay vertex can be measured with high precision, the mass of such particles can be measured by exploiting the constrained kinematics of an\(e^+e^-\)collider. The mass resolution achievable with this technique is studied through a detailed analysis in the framework of a parametrised simulation of the performance of the IDEA detector. The adopted benchmark model is the production of Heavy Neutral Leptons, which is one of the key channels for new physics discovery at the FCC-ee.
AMoRE-II aims to search for neutrinoless double beta decay (\(0\nu \beta \beta \)) with an array of 423\(\hbox {Li}_2^{100}\hbox {MoO}_4\)crystals operating in the cryogenic system as the main phase of the Advanced Molybdenum-based Rare process Experiment (AMoRE). AMoRE has been planned to operate in three phases: AMoRE-pilot, AMoRE-I, and AMoRE-II. AMoRE-II is currently being installed at the Yemi Underground Laboratory, located approximately 1000 m deep in Jeongseon, Korea. The goal of the experiment is to reach an exclusion half-life sensitivity to the\(0\nu \beta \beta \)of\(^{100}\)Mo on the level of\(T^{0\nu \beta \beta }_{1/2} > 6 \times 10^{26}\)year that covers completely the inverted Majorana neutrino mass hierarchy region of (15–46) meV. To achieve this, the background level of the experimental configurations and possible background sources of gamma and beta events should be well understood. We have intensively performed Monte Carlo simulations using the GEANT4 toolkit in all the experimental configurations with potential sources. We report the estimated background level that meets the\(10^{-4}\)counts/(keV\(\cdot \)kg\(\cdot \)year) requirement for AMoRE-II in the Region Of Interest (ROI) and show the projected half-life sensitivity based on the simulation study.
Exoplanets and smaller bodies have been detected orbiting different kind of stars. However, we do not know of any such objects in planetary nebulae, the short-lived stage of stellar evolution between the asymptotic giant branch and white dwarf phases. The planetary activity (destruction and formation) may be accompanied by dust clouds. Hence, we searched for dust occultation events in planetary nebulae using archival photometric data. We show that the central star of PN WeSb 1 features numerous dimming events with typical durations of a few days to weeks that are up to 3 mag deep. This variability is mainly stochastic with an indication of a 400 d period. The occultations are almost grey, indicating dust grains larger than about 0.1 μm. Based on our follow-up observations, we argue that the central star is a wide binary and that these events are most probably caused by debris from disintegrated small rocky bodies that escaped from the former asymptotic giant branch star to find safe harbour around the companion star. The latter star dominates the optical spectrum enabling us to see the eclipses. This means that planetary systems are present and undergo violent evolution during the planetary nebula stage.
The work investigates absorption of a twisted photon, which possesses quantized total angular momentum (TAM), by a relativistic electron with the Lorentz factor\(\displaystyle \gamma \sim 1{-}10\)in a strong magnetic field up to the Schwinger limit,\(\displaystyle H_c = 4.4\cdot 10^{13}\)G. We examine the absorption cross sections and their dependence on the parameters of the incident photon and the initial Landau electron. It is found that total absorption cross sections decrease as angular momentum of the incident photon increases and increase as angular momentum of the initial electron grows. The process is also compared across different magnetic field strengths, and the contribution of various electron spin transitions to total absorption cross section is analyzed. We also find that the processes without an electron spin flip dominate and, on top of that, an asymmetry in the “spin-down”\(\displaystyle \rightarrow \)“spin-up” and the “spin-up”\(\displaystyle \rightarrow \)“spin-down” transitions is observed. Specifically, the cross sections for the “spin-down”\(\displaystyle \rightarrow \)“spin-up” transition are larger, which can be interpreted as an analogy of the Sokolov–Ternov effect present for photon emission. Finally, the cross sections are found to be almost constant as the transverse momentum of the photon varies from 0.1 eV to 100 keV. Our findings can help to improve the understanding of the QED processes in critical fields, typical for astrophysical environments, e.g. magnetospheres of neutron stars.
We consider T-dualities arising from global symmetries in two dimensional Gauged Linear Sigma Models (GLSMs). The model has\(\mathcal {N}=(2,2)\)supersymmetry,U(1) gauge group, and leads to the susy vacuum of the resolved conifold. It possesses the non-Abelian global symmetry\(SU(2) \times SU(2)\). A non-Abelian T-duality can be constructed, which can be described by gauging the global non-Abelian symmetry. This leads to a dual action, in terms of the dual model’s Kähler and superpotential terms, which include a dependence on twisted chiral superfields. The effective superpotentials for theU(1) vector superfield in the original and dual models are matched, determining the instanton corrections of the dual action. This is an important observable in the UV regime, which establishes the duality. We obtain the supersymmetry vacuum solution of the dual model in three cases: first, in an Abelian direction inside\(SU(2) \times SU(2)\); second, for an Abelian direction considering instanton corrections; and finally, for a semi-chiral non-Abelian vector superfield. The dual geometry for the cases without instanton corrections (SUSY vacuum space) is given by\(T^5 \times \mathbb {R}\). For the duality with instanton corrections, one obtains the vacuum space\(T^3 \times \mathbb {R}^2\), and with IR modifications to the twisted superpotential, one obtains a 3-fold given as a cubic polynomial on\((\mathbb {C}^{\times })^3 \times \mathbb {C}\). We discuss the\(U(1)_A\)axial R-symmetry in the dual model and its possible role.
Extended dark matter objects (EDOs) are popular dark matter candidates that interact gravitationally with the Standard Model. These gravitational interactions can be used to constrain their allowed parameter space. However, EDOs can have different formation mechanisms, sizes, and shapes, requiring a case-by-case analysis when studying their impact on different areas of cosmology. We thus present arepositoryof all available bounds for these objects, with a code that allows plotting user-defined combinations of all up-to-date bounds for a given shape and different radii. We propose a standard for the EDOs’ mass profiles so that different sets of bounds are consistent with each other, and provide instructions on using the code and contributing to the repository.
Charged-particle trajectories are usually reconstructed with the LHCb detector using combined information from the tracking devices placed upstream and downstream of the 4 T m dipole magnet. Trajectories reconstructed using only information from the tracker downstream of the dipole magnet, which are referred to as T tracks, have not been used for physics analysis to date. The challenges of the reconstruction of long-lived particles with T tracks for physics use are discussed and solutions are proposed. The feasibility and the tracking performance are studied using samples of long-lived\(\varvec{\Lambda }\)and\(K_S^0\)hadrons decaying between 6.0 and 7.6 m downstream of the proton–proton collision point, thereby traversing most of the magnetic field region and providing maximal sensitivity to magnetic and electric dipole moments. The reconstruction can be expanded upstream to about 2.5 m for use in direct searches of exotic long-lived particles. The data used in this analysis have been recorded between 2015 and 2018 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 6\(\hbox {fb}^{-1}\). The results obtained demonstrate the possibility to further extend the decay volume and the physics reach of the LHCb experiment.
Strong gravitational magnification enables the detection of faint background sources and allows researchers to resolve their internal structures and even identify individual stars in distant galaxies. Highly magnified individual stars are useful in various applications, including studies of stellar populations in distant galaxies and constraining dark matter structures in the lensing plane. However, these applications have been hampered by the small number of individual stars observed, as typically one or a few stars are identified from each distant galaxy. Here, we report the discovery of more than 40 microlensed stars in a single galaxy behind Abell 370 at redshift of 0.725 (dubbed ‘the Dragon arc’) when the Universe was half of its current age, using James Webb Space Telescope observations with the time-domain technique. These events were found near the expected lensing critical curves, suggesting that these are magnified stars that appear as transients from intracluster stellar microlenses. Through multi-wavelength photometry, we constrained their stellar types and found that many of them are consistent with red giants or supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds. This finding reveals a high occurrence of microlensing events in the Dragon arc and demonstrates that time-domain observations by the James Webb Space Telescope could lead to the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.
Numerous non-standard interactions between neutrinos and scalar fields have been suggested in the literature. In this work, we have outlined the case of tensorial neutrino non-standard interactions with scalar fields, which can be related to the effective\(\textit{CPT}\)-even dimension-4 operators of the Standard Model Extension (SME). We illustrate how bounds placed on these parameters can be associated with limits on the energy scale of the proposed neutrino interactions with cosmic scalars. Besides, as a case study, we employ a DUNE-like experimental configuration to assess the projected sensitivities to the\(\textit{CPT}\)-even isotropic\(c_{\alpha \beta }\)andZ-spatial\(c_{\alpha \beta }^{ZZ}\)SME coefficients. For the case of the isotropic SME coefficients, an upper limit on the energy scale of the interaction can be placed. The current IceCube experiment and upcoming neutrino experiments such as DUNE, KM3NeT, IceCube-Gen2, and GRAND proposals, may clarify these classes of neutrino non-standard interactions.
We explore the decay of bound neutrons in the JUNO liquid scintillator detector into invisible particles (e.g.,\(n\rightarrow 3 \nu \)or\(nn \rightarrow 2 \nu \)), which do not produce an observable signal. The invisible decay includes two decay modes:\( n \rightarrow { inv} \)and\( nn \rightarrow { inv} \). The invisible decays ofs-shell neutrons in\(^{12}\textrm{C}\)will leave a highly excited residual nucleus. Subsequently, some de-excitation modes of the excited residual nuclei can produce a time- and space-correlated triple coincidence signal in the JUNO detector. Based on a full Monte Carlo simulation informed with the latest available data, we estimate all backgrounds, including inverse beta decay events of the reactor antineutrino\({\bar{\nu }}_e\), natural radioactivity, cosmogenic isotopes and neutral current interactions of atmospheric neutrinos. Pulse shape discrimination and multivariate analysis techniques are employed to further suppress backgrounds. With two years of exposure, JUNO is expected to give an order of magnitude improvement compared to the current best limits. After 10 years of data taking, the JUNO expected sensitivities at a 90% confidence level are\(\tau /B( n \rightarrow { inv} ) > 5.0 \times 10^{31} \, \textrm{years}\)and\(\tau /B( nn \rightarrow { inv} ) > 1.4 \times 10^{32} \, \textrm{years}\).
In this work, we address the question of how to enhance signal-agnostic searches by leveraging multiple testing strategies. Specifically, we consider hypothesis tests relying on machine learning, where model selection can introduce a bias towards specific families of new physics signals. Focusing on the New Physics Learning Machine, a methodology to perform a signal-agnostic likelihood-ratio test, we explore a number of approaches to multiple testing, such as combiningp-values and aggregating test statistics. Our findings show that it is beneficial to combine different tests, characterised by distinct choices of hyperparameters, and that performances comparable to the best available test are generally achieved, while also providing a more uniform response to various types of anomalies. This study proposes a methodology that is valid beyond machine learning approaches and could in principle be applied to a larger class model-agnostic analyses based on hypothesis testing.
In the conventional method of studying wormhole (WH) geometry, traversability requires the presence of exotic matter, which also provides negative gravity effects to keep the wormhole throat open. In de Rham–Gabadadze–Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory, we produce two types of WH solutions in our present paper. We obtain the field equations for exact WH solutions by selecting a static and spherically symmetric metric for the background geometry. We derive the WH geometry completely for the two different choices of redshift functions. The obtained WH solutions violate all the energy conditions, including the null energy condition (NEC). Various plots are used to illustrate the behavior of the wormhole for a suitable range of\(m^2c_1\), wheremis the graviton mass. It is observed that the photon deflection angle becomes negative for all values of\(m^2c_1\)as a result of the repulsive action of gravity. It is also shown that the repulsive impact of massive gravitons pushes the spacetime geometry so strongly that the asymptotic flatness is affected. The volume integral quantifier (VIQ) is computed to determine the amounts of matter that violate the null energy condition. The complexity factor of the proposed model is also discussed.
Cosmic rays (CRs) play a pivotal role in shaping the thermal and dynamical properties of astrophysical environments, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Recent observations suggest a stronger confinement of CRs in certain astrophysical systems than predicted by current CR-transport theories. Here, we show that the incorporation of microscale physics into CR-transport models can account for this enhanced CR confinement. We develop a theoretical description of the effect of magnetic microscale fluctuations originating from the mirror instability on macroscopic CR diffusion. We confirm our theory with large-dynamical-range simulations of CR transport in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters and kinetic simulations of CR transport in micromirror fields. We conclude that sub-teraelectronvolt CR confinement in the ICM is far more effective than previously anticipated on the basis of Galactic-transport extrapolations. The transformative impact of micromirrors on CR diffusion provides insights into how microphysics can reciprocally affect macroscopic dynamics and observable structures across a range of astrophysical scales.
A comprehensive extension of the ordinary 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), supplemented by vector-like quarks (VLQs), in the “alignment limit” is presented. In such a scenario, we study the possibility that large hadron collider (LHC) searches for VLQs can profile their nature too, i.e., whether they belong to a singlet, doublet, or triplet representation. To achieve this, we exploit both standard model (SM) decays of VLQs with top-(anti)quark electromagnetic (EM) charge (T), i.e., intob,tquarks and\(W^\pm , Z,h\)bosons (which turn out to be suppressed and henceTstates can escape existing limits) as well as their exotic decays, i.e., intob,t(and possiblyB) quarks and\(H^\pm , H, A\)bosons. We show that quite specific decay patterns emerge in the different VLQ representations so that, depending upon whichTsignals are accessed at the LHC, one may be able to ascertain the underlying beyond standard model (BSM) structure, especially if mass knowledge of the new fermionic and bosonic sectors can be inferred from (other) data.
In the presence of a transition magnetic moment between active and sterile neutrinos, sterile neutrinos could be produced by neutrino beams electromagnetically upscattering on nuclei. We study the active-sterile neutrino transition magnetic moment through this upscattering in the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process induced by solar neutrinos. We place new limits on the transition magnetic moment-sterile neutrino mass plane using the latest data from the CDEX-10 experiment. We also provide projected sensitivities for future measurements. We observe that the projected sensitivities could cover some regions of the parameter space which were previously unexplored for the sterile neutrino mass up to\(\sim 10\)MeV.
In this paper, we investigate one of the established methods for reconstructing modified gravity models from a dark energy model, with the aim of discovering relationships between these theories. In this study, we focus on thef(R,T) modified gravity theory, whereRdenotes the Ricci scalar andTrepresents the trace of the energy–momentum tensor. We employ Barrow’s holographic dark energy model, derived from fractal surfaces of black holes, to investigate the reconstruction process. The numerical results are subsequently presented for various infrared cutoffs, such as the Hubble horizon, future event horizon, and Granda–Oliveros cutoff.
This paper discusses the phenomenon of evolving spherically symmetric cluster of stars in the presence of an exotic matter. To discuss evolutionary mechanism, we use the Starobinsky model off(R) gravity as exotic matter and the structure scalars as evolutional parameters. We study various evolution modes such as isotropic pressure, quasi-homologous evolution, density homogeneity, and geodesic nature. The stability of  homogeneous density of baryonic and non-baryonic matter is discussed using dissipation, tidal forces, anisotropic pressures, expansion and shear-effects. It is observed that the dark matter has remarkable impact on the evolutionary changes. Also, it is shown that the dissipation factor produces density inhomogeneity in expanding clusters with shear effects. We observe that high curvature geometry enhances quasi-homologous evolution in the presence of shear. We use star Her X-1 as test star to discuss physical behavior of Starobinsky model. It is found that the density of dark matter overcomes the density of matter for large values of dark matter parametern.
The strong gravitational potential of neutron stars (NSs) makes them ideal astrophysical objects for testing extreme gravity phenomena. We explore the potential of NS X-ray pulsed light curve observations to probe deviations from general relativity (GR) within the scalar–tensor theory (STT) of gravity framework. We compute the flux from a single, circular, finite-size hot spot, accounting for light bending, Shapiro time delay, and Doppler effect. We focus on the high-compactness regime, i.e., close to the critical GR value\(GM/(c^2 R)=0.284\), over which multiple images of the spot appear and impact crucially the light curves. Our investigation is motivated by the increased sensitivity of the pulse to the scalar charge of the spacetime in such high compactness regimes, making these systems exceptionally suitable for scrutinizing deviations from GR, notably phenomena such as spontaneous scalarization, as predicted by STT. We find significant differences in NS observables, e.g., the flux of a single spot can differ up to 80% with respect to GR. Additionally, reasonable choices for the STT parameters that satisfy astrophysical constraints lead to changes in the NS radius relative to GR of up to approximately 10%. Consequently, scalar parameters might be better constrained when uncertainties in NS radii decrease, where this could occur with the advent of next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA, as well as future electromagnetic missions like eXTP and ATHENA. Thus, our findings suggest that accurate X-ray data of the NS surface emission, jointly with refined theoretical models, could constrain STTs.
Using Darmois-Israel-Sen junction conditions, and with help of Visser’s cut-and-paste method, we study the dynamics of thin-shell wormholes that are made of two conformally Killing gravity (a.k.a Harada gravity) black holes. We check the energy conditions for different values of the new parameter that Harada introduced, as alternative for dark energy. We examine the radial acceleration to reveal the attractive and repulsive characteristics of the thin-shell wormhole throat. We consider the dynamics and stability of the wormhole around the static solutions of the linearized radial perturbations at the wormhole throat. Finally, we determine the regions of stability by applying the concavity test on the “speed of sound” as a function in the throat radius and other spacetime parameters, particularly the new Harada parameter.
The discrepancy between the observed value of the cosmological constant (CC) and its expected value from quantum field theoretical considerations motivates the search for a theory in which the CC is decoupled from the vacuum energy. In this article, we consider the viability of theories in which the Einstein equations are recovered (without additional constraints) and in which the CC is regarded as an integration constant. These theories include trace-free Einstein gravity, theories constructed from the Codazzi equation (which includes Cotton gravity and a gauge-gravity inspired theory), and conformal Killing gravity. We remark on a recent debate regarding Cotton gravity and find that while the Codazzi equation of that theory is indeed underdetermined, the solutions of the Codazzi equation trivialize to\(\lambda g_{ab}\)on generic backgrounds, and that in principle, one can close the system with the divergence-free condition and an appropriate choice of initial data. We also propose a full variational principle (full in the sense that variations in all variables are considered) for each of the aforementioned theories that can incorporate the matter sector; in this manner, we can obtain the trace-free Einstein equations without a unimodular constraint. The resulting actions require additional (auxiliary) fields and are therefore only expected to be effective, but they may provide a useful starting point in bottom up approaches to constructing more fundamental theories.
The Tolman VII space-time is one of the few physically acceptable exact solutions in general relativity. In this paper, we derive a generalised Tolman VII solution which includes a charge and a cosmological constant. We analyse the spatial geometry of the solution and present conditions for zero and non-zero spatial curvature. We show that for a particular value of the boundary, the Tolman VII space-time can be matched to the charged Nariai space-time. This represents a new class of interior Nariai solutions. Matching with the Reissner–Nordström-de Sitter space-time, we derive analytic expressions for the metric functions and the pressure. Using this, we show that the solution allows for trapped null geodesics for a broad range of values for the total charge, central density, and the cosmological constant. We investigate the physical properties and derive an equation of state for the fluid. We show that the fluid can be considered a polytrope with,\(\Gamma \sim 2.5\). Finally, we analyse the sound speed and energy conditions to conclude that only a subclass of the solution follows all the basic physical acceptability criteria.
Properties of the underlying-event inppinteractions are investigated primarily via the strange hadrons\(K_{S}^{0}\),\(\Lambda \)and\(\bar{\Lambda }\), as reconstructed using the ATLAS detector at the LHC in minimum-biasppcollision data at\(\sqrt{s} = 13\)TeV. The hadrons are reconstructed via the identification of the displaced two-particle vertices corresponding to the decay modes,\(\Lambda \rightarrow \pi ^-p\)and\(\bar{\Lambda }\rightarrow \pi ^+\bar{p}\). These are used in the construction of underlying-event observables in azimuthal regions computed relative to the leading charged-particle jet in the event. None of the hadronisation and underlying-event physics models considered can describe the data over the full kinematic range considered. Events with a leading charged-particle jet in the range of\(10 < p_T \le 40\)GeV are studied using the number of prompt charged particles in the transverse region. The ratio\(N(\Lambda + \bar{\Lambda })/N(K_{S}^{0})\)as a function of the number of such charged particles varies only slightly over this range. This disagrees with the expectations of some of the considered Monte Carlo models.
We present the first calculation of photon-initiated\(\tau \)pair production in the presence of non-zero anomalous magnetic (\(a_\tau \)) and/or electric dipole (\(d_\tau \)) moments of the\(\tau \)lepton that accounts for the non-trivial interplay between these modifications with the soft survival factor and the possibility of dissociation of the hadron (proton or ion) beam. The impact of these is on general grounds not expected to have a uniform dependence on the value of\(a_\tau , d_\tau \), but in all previous analyses this assumption has been made. We have therefore investigated the importance of these effects in the context of photon-initiated\(\tau \)pair production in both pp and PbPb collisions. This is in general found to be relatively small, at the percent level in terms of any extracted limits or observations of\(a_\tau , d_\tau \), such that these effects can indeed be safely ignored in existing experimental analyses. However, as the precision of such determinations increases in the future, the relevance of these effects will likewise increase. With this in mind we have made our calculation publicly available in theSuperChicMonte Carlo generator, including the possibility to simulate this process for varying\(a_\tau , d_\tau \)without rerunning.
The azimuthal correlation angle,\(\Delta \phi \), between the scattered lepton and the leading jet in deep inelastic\(e^{\pm }p\)scattering at HERA has been studied using data collected with the ZEUS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of\(\sqrt{s} = 318 {\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-0.66666pt}\text {V}}\), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\(326 \,\text {pb}^{-1}\). A measurement of jet cross sections in the laboratory frame was made in a fiducial region corresponding to photon virtuality\(10 {\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-0.66666pt}\text {V}}^2< Q^2 < 350 {\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-0.66666pt}\text {V}}^2\), inelasticity\(0.04< y < 0.7\), outgoing lepton energy\(E_e > 10 {\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-0.66666pt}\text {V}}\), lepton polar angle\(140^\circ< \theta _e < 180^\circ \), jet transverse momentum\(2.5 {\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-0.66666pt}\text {V}}< p_\textrm{T,jet} < 30 {\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-0.66666pt}\text {V}}\), and jet pseudorapidity\(-1.5< \eta _\textrm{jet} < 1.8\). Jets were reconstructed using the\(k_\textrm{T}\)algorithm with the radius parameter\(R = 1\). The leading jet in an event is defined as the jet that carries the highest\(p_\textrm{T,jet}\). Differential cross sections,\(d\sigma /d\Delta \phi \), were measured as a function of the azimuthal correlation angle in various ranges of leading-jet transverse momentum, photon virtuality and jet multiplicity. Perturbative calculations at\(\mathcal {O}(\alpha _{s}^2)\)accuracy successfully describe the data within the fiducial region, although a lower level of agreement is observed near\(\Delta \phi \rightarrow \pi \)for events with high jet multiplicity, due to limitations of the perturbative approach in describing soft phenomena in QCD. The data are equally well described by Monte Carlo predictions that supplement leading-order matrix elements with parton showering.
We analyse neutral and charged matter distributions in second order Lovelock gravity, also known as Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity, in arbitrary dimensions for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime. We first transform the charged condition of pressure isotropy, an Abel differential equation of the second kind, into canonical form. We then determine a systematic approach to integrate the condition of pressure isotropy by showing that the canonical form is a Chini differential equation. The Chini invariant, which allows the master differential equation to be separable, is identified. This enables us to find three new general solutions, in implicit form, to the condition of pressure isotropy. We also show that previously obtained exact specific solutions arise as special cases in our general class of models. The Chini invariant does not arise in general relativity; it is a distinguishing feature of Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity.
We have studied the leptonic EDM and the LFV decays relating with the recent data of anomalous magnetic moment of muon,\((g-2)_{\mu }\)in the leptonic dipole operator. We have adopted the successful\(\Gamma _2\)modular invariant model by Meloni–Parriciatu as the flavor symmetry of leptons. Suppose the anomaly of\((g-2)_{\mu }\),\(\Delta a_{\mu }\)to be evidence of New Physics (NP), we have related it with the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron\(\Delta a_e\), the electron EDM\(d_e\)and the\(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma \)decay. We found that the NP contributions to\(\Delta a_{e(\mu )}\)are proportional to the lepton masses squared likewise the naive scaling\(\Delta a_\ell \propto m^2_\ell \). The experimental constraint of\(|d_e|\)is much tight compared with the one from the branching ratio\(\mathcal {B} (\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )\)in our framework. Supposing the phase of our model parameter\(\delta _{\alpha }\)for the electron to be of order one, we have estimated the upper-bound of\(\mathcal {B}(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )\), which is at most\(10^{-21}-10^{-20}\). If some model parameters are real, leptonic EDMs vanish since the CP phase of the modular form due to modulus\(\tau \)does not contribute to the EDM. However, we can obtain\(\mathcal {B} (\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )\simeq 10^{-13}\)with non-vanishing\(d_e\)in a specific case. The imaginary part of a parameter can lead to\(d_e\)in the next-to-leading contribution. The predicted electron EDM is below\(10^{-32}\)e cm, while\(\mathcal {B} (\mu \rightarrow e \gamma )\)is close to the experimental upper-bound. The branching ratios of\(\tau \rightarrow e\gamma \)and\(\tau \rightarrow \mu \gamma \)are also discussed.
This article analyses the stability of thin-shell wormholes constructed from non-asymptotically flat wormholes and the vacuum Schwarzschild solution. The construction of these spherically symmetric thin shells focuses on a specific class of wormholes characterized by a shape function that is linearly dependent on the radial coordinate. This introduces angular defects, which can be either deficits or excesses in the solid angle. To analyze the stability of these structures, we employ linear perturbations around a static solution, using a master equation to describe the behavior of stable equilibrium regions. The study is systematically divided to examine both positive and negative surface energy densities, and it delves into various gravitational redshift functions. Finally, it is concluded that the interaction of an external force on the thin shell significantly influences the behaviour of stable regions. It is demonstrated that, in certain cases, the matter supporting the thin shell may be non-exotic, fully satisfying all energy conditions.
We explore black hole solutions and some of its physical properties in Einstein’s theory in 4D, modified by a cubic gravity term and in the presence of non-linear electrodynamics. In the context of Effective Field Theories (EFT) and under certain assumptions, these curvature and non-linear electromagnetic terms represent the first corrections to the Einstein-Maxwell theory. We obtain static and spherically symmetric generalizations to the asymptotically flat Reissner-Nordström metric using perturbative methods, showing how an asymptotic expansion solution connects with a near horizon solution for a small coupling of the curvature correction term. We perform a thermodynamic stability analysis of the solutions. Finally, we discuss how these EFT corrections change the event horizon properties and also lead to measurable effects on black hole shadows and gravitational lensing around these solutions.
How was Lattice Gauge Theory born? What was it like in the “early days” of the 1970s and 80s before lattice field theory became a substantial subfield of high energy theory? How did high energy physics and condensed matter theory get together? What were the big physics problems and technical challenges of the day? This short talk looks at these topics from one person’s personal recollections, experiences and perspective.
Neutron stars are natural laboratories for testing gravity in the strong field regime. That is why the full spectrum of neutron star solutions in different modified theories should be thoroughly studied. Among the most natural modifications of general relativity are the theories in which additional scalar degrees of freedom are present. That is why scalar-tensor theories like Brans–Dicke and Damour–Esposito–Farese theories, as well as their extensions such as scalar-Gauss–Bonnet gravity, attracted attention throughout the years. In the present work, we combine those theory families and explore extensively the neutron star solution space in their realm. We identify qualitative new behavior of the solutions, including the existence of new types of phase transitions and new branches of solutions present only for high neutron star masses. Due to the peculiarities of the solutions, they can not be easily mimicked by a simple change of the equation of state.
The status of the equivalence principle in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity is examined. In this theory, minimum length geodesics are distinct from autoparallel geodesics, that is, the “shortest” paths are not the “straightest” paths. We show that a standard argument that singles out metric geodesics in general relativity does not apply in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity. This is because the latter theory does not obey the equivalence principle in the sense of Weinberg. We argue, however, that the structure of the theory makes it inevitable that a freely falling test particle follows a shortest path, a geodesic of the metric. The geodesic equation that governs the motion of a freely falling test particle involves the Levi-Civita connection, not some other connection obtained by solving the connection field equations of the theory. This also has bearing on whether, under appropriate conditions, modified symmetric teleparallel gravity is fully equivalent to general relativity.
Constituent quarks in a nucleon are the essential elements in the standard “quark model” associated with the electric charge, spin, mass, and baryon number of a nucleon. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes nucleon as a composite object containing current quarks (valence quarks and sea (anti-)quarks) and gluons. These subatomic elements and their interactions are known to contribute in complex ways to the overall nucleon spin and mass. In the early development of QCD theory in the 1970s, an alternative hypothesis postulated that the baryon number might manifest itself through a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields forming a Y-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. In this work, we propose to test such hypothesis by measuring (i) the Regge intercept of the net-baryon distributions fore+(p)Au collisions, (ii) baryon and charge transport in the isobaric ratio betweene+Ru ande+Zr collisions, and (iii) target flavor dependence of proton and antiproton yields at large rapidity, transported from the hydrogen and deuterium targets in\(e+p\)(d) collisions. Our study indicates that these measurements at the EIC can help determine what carries the baryon number.
Recently, the ring images or the shadow images of the centers of the galaxy M87 and the Milky way have been reported by Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. It is believed that the ring images imply that the central objects form unstable light circular orbits. Some of wormholes with\(Z_2\)symmetry against a throat are wrongly excluded from the candidates at the centers of M87 and the Milky way due to the overlooking the unstable light circular orbits on the throat. A general asymptotically-flat, static, and spherical symmetrical wormhole without a thin shell has at least one unstable circular light orbit at the throat or elsewhere. If the wormhole has\(Z_2\)symmetry against the throat, it has the unstable circular light orbits on the throat or it has stable circular light orbits on the throat and unstable ones near the throat. We need to analyze the throat carefully to make sure we do not unfairly rule out the\(Z_2\)-symmetrical wormholes. In this study, we categorize the numbers of the circular light orbits of the\(Z_2\)-symmetrical wormhole and their stability from the derivatives of an effective potential at the throat and we investigate the circular light orbits around a Simpson–Visser black-bounce spacetime, a Damour–Solodukhin wormhole spacetime, a Reissner–Nordström black-hole-like wormhole spacetime or a charged Damour–Solodukhin wormhole spacetime as examples. We give complete treatments including degenerated circular light orbits made from more than one stable and unstable circular light orbits on and off the throat.
The electrical conductivity of hot and dense quark matter is calculated using the 2-flavour gauged Nambu–Jona–Lasinio (NJL) model in the presence of a chiral imbalance quantified in terms of a chiral chemical potential (CCP). To this end, the in-medium spectral function corresponding to the vector current correlator is evaluated employing the real time formulation of finite temperature field theory. Taking the long wavelength limit of the spectral function we extract the electrical conductivity using the Green–Kubo relation. The thermal widths of the quarks/antiquarks that appear in the expression of electrical conductivity are calculated by considering the\(2\rightarrow 2\)scattering in the NJL model. The scattering amplitudes containing the polarization functions of the mesonic modes in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels are also evaluated by considering finite value of CCP. We find that the ratio of electrical conductivity to temperature has significant dependence on CCP especially in the low temperature region.
In this paper, we investigate a generalization of Kiselev black holes by introducing a varying equation-of-state parameter for the anisotropic fluid surrounding the black hole. We extend this model by allowingwin the expression\(p_t(r)/\rho (r) = (3w + 1)/2\)to vary as a function of the radial coordinate, and derive new solutions to the Einstein field equations for this configuration. In particular, we study solutions that describe regular black holes. By choosing specific forms ofw(r), we obtain regular black hole solutions, and show that the matter surrounding the black hole can satisfy the weak and strong energy conditions under certain values of parameters analyzed. Due to the generality of this treatment, other categories of black holes can be obtained with particular choices of the equation-of-state parameter. Our analysis confirms that the curvature invariants associated with the regular black holes remain finite at the origin, indicating the absence of singularities. We also explore the physical properties of the matter associated with these solutions. Due to its versatility, we suggest the possibility of using this approach as a tool to construct new physical solutions associated with regular black holes or other geometries of interest.
Using the dynamical systems approach together with the cosmographic parameters, we present amodel-independentdynamical system formulation for cosmology inf(R) gravity. The formulation is model-independent in the sense that one needs to specify not a particular functional form off(R) a-priori, but rather a particular cosmological evolution, which fixes the cosmography. In a sense, our approach is the way around the reconstruction method. This is shown using both non-compact and compact dynamical variables. The focus in this paper is on the compact analysis since we demonstrate the applicability of this formulation using examples of bouncing and cyclic cosmology. In particular, our analysis reveals, in a model-independent manner, the problem of achieving such cosmologies when the universe is globally spatially flat and devoid of matter.
Highly magnetized neutron stars have quantum refraction effects on pulsar emission due to the non-linearity of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) action. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the polarization states of pulsar emission under the quantum refraction effects, combined with the dependence on the emission frequency, for dipole and quadrudipole pulsar models; we solve a system of evolution equations of the Stokes vector, where the birefringent vector, in which such effects are encoded, acts on the Stokes vector. At a fixed emission frequency, depending on the magnitude of the birefringent vector, dominated mostly by the magnetic field strength, the evolution of the Stokes vector largely exhibits three different patterns: (i) monotonic, or (ii) half-oscillatory, or (iii) highly oscillatory behaviors. These features are understood and confirmed by means of approximate analytical solutions to the evolution equations. Also, the evolution patterns are shown to differ between dipole and quadrudipole pulsar models, depending on the magnetic field strength.
A phenomenological analysis based on the published branching fractions andCPasymmetry observables of the\(B\rightarrow K\pi \),\(B\rightarrow \pi \pi \)and\(B\rightarrow KK\)dataset is performed. The amplitude decomposition by the topological diagrams and theSU(3) irreducible representation is used. The result of the global fit can be interpreted as a solution to the “\(B\rightarrow K\pi \)puzzle”. The obtained precision enables to test aSU(3)-based sum rule showing\(6\sigma \)discrepancy with the expectation value in the Standard Model scenario. To improve the obtained results the main effort should concentrate on the\(B^0\rightarrow K^0\pi ^0\)measurements.
Due to the spin-orbit coupling, Dirac fermions, submerged in a thermal bath with finite macroscopic vorticity, exhibit a spin polarisation along the direction parallel to the vorticity vector\(\varvec{\Omega }\). Due to the symmetries of the Lagrangian for free massless Dirac particles, there are three independent and classically conserved currents corresponding to the vector, axial, and helical charges. The constitutive relations for the charge currents and the stress-energy tensor at thermal equilibrium, derived in the framework of quantum field theory at finite temperature, reveal vorticity-induced contributions that deviate from the perfect fluid form. In this paper, we consider the mode structure of the corresponding hydrodynamical theory and derive collective excitations associated with coherent fluctuations of all three charges. We show that the chirally imbalanced rotating fluid should possess non-reciprocal gapless waves that propagate with different velocities along and opposite to the vorticity vector. We also uncover a strictly unidirectional mode, which we call the axial vortical wave, propagating in the background of the axial charge density. The emergence of this wave can be traced back to earlier studies of vortical chiral fluids in a hydrodynamic approach. We also point out an unexpected instability in the limit of degenerate matter and discuss possible solutions when helicity and axial charge non-conservation are taken into account.
This study examines the compatibility of the generalized holographic equipartition proposed in Sheykhi (Phys Rev D 87(6):061501, 2013) with the maximization of horizon entropy in an (n + 1)-dimensional non-flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) universe. Here, the entropy associated with the apparent horizon is described by Kaniadakis entropy, as well as truncated Kaniadakis entropy, which is expanded and truncated to third order when the Kaniadakis parameter\((K)\)is small, indicating minor deviations from the standard Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. Initially, we derive the conditions required for maximizing both Kaniadakis horizon entropy and truncated Kaniadakis horizon entropy. We then examine whether the generalized holographic equipartition aligns with the constraints of horizon entropy maximization. Our findings reveal that the generalized holographic equipartition is consistent with the maximization of Kaniadakis horizon entropy and truncated Kaniadakis horizon entropy in a universe with non-zero spatial curvature.
We investigate thermodynamics of apparent horizon in thef(Q) universe with trivial and nontrivial connections. We first explore the perspectives of  the first law, generalized second law andP–Vphase transition with trivial connection. We show that the lowest-order correction of entropy has the same form as that in loop quantum gravity, and the critical exponents of the phase transition caused by the lowest-order correction are consistent with those in mean field theory. We then examine the thermodynamic implication of nontrivial connections. We find that nontrivial connections in thef(Q) universe imply non-equilibrium states from the perspective of thermodynamics.
We construct exact analytical Taub-NUT solutions in the context off(T) gravity. We study the physical properties of the solutions, and compare them with those of the Taub-NUT solution in Einstein gravity.
We examine the stability of a spherically symmetric regular black hole when subjected to perturbations from a charged scalar field. This particular black hole is constructed by deforming the Minkowski spacetime. It has been  observed that the charged superradiant instability arises only within a specific range of the deformation parameter, potentially resulting in an instability growth rate with a maximum magnitude of approximately\(\text {Im} (M \omega ) \sim 10^{-3}\). This growth rate significantly exceeds the instability identified in ABG black holes discussed in prior research, suggesting a notable timescale for detecting this phenomenon in astrophysical scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a thorough investigation into how the three parameters of the model influence the onset and intensity of the instability. Our analysis offers further insights into the possible emergence of this instability in spherical regular black holes and its association with the nonlinear effects of the electromagnetic field.
The ATLAS tile calorimeter (TileCal) is the hadronic sampling calorimeter covering the central region of the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This paper gives an overview of the calorimeter’s operation and performance during the years 2015–2018 (Run 2). In this period, ATLAS collected proton–proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and the TileCal was 99.65% efficient for data-taking. The signal reconstruction, the calibration procedures, and the detector operational status are presented. The performance of two ATLAS trigger systems making use of TileCal information, the minimum-bias trigger scintillators and the tile muon trigger, is discussed. Studies of radiation effects allow the degradation of the output signals at the end of the LHC and HL-LHC operations to be estimated. Finally, the TileCal response to isolated muons, hadrons and jets from proton–proton collisions is presented. The energy and time calibration methods performed excellently, resulting in good stability and uniformity of the calorimeter response during Run 2. The setting of the energy scale was performed with an uncertainty of 2%. The results demonstrate that the performance is in accordance with specifications defined in the Technical Design Report.
We explore wormhole solutions sourced by Casimir energy density involving generalized uncertainty principle corrections within the framework of Rastall–Rainbow gravity. The questions of traversability and stability, as well as the presence of exotic matter, are carefully investigated. In particular, the stability issue is addressed via an approach that has not been previously employed in the context of wormholes. This method, which represents an improved version of the so-called Herrera cracking technique, has the potential to yield novel insights in the field of wormhole geometries.
Compact stars have long served as a test bed of gravitational models and their coupling with stellar matter. In this work, we explore the behavior of an exponential model inf(T) gravity through the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. This is performed for different envelope thicknesses. Finally, constraints on the models parameters are obtained, which are comparable to the results obtained using cosmological survey data. This consistency across the strong astrophysical and weak cosmological scales shows reasonable viability of the underlying model.
We extend the formalism of tri-vector deformations to the full SL(5) exceptional field theory with no truncation assumed thus covering 11D backgrounds of any form. We derive explicit transformation rules for 11D supergravity component fields and prove that these generate solutions given the same algebraic conditions hold: generalized Yang–Baxter equation and the unimodularity condition.
We report on the reactions\(\psi (3770)\rightarrow \bar{\Omega }^+ \bar{K} \Xi \)and\(\psi (3770)\rightarrow \bar{\Omega }^+ \bar{K}\Xi ^*(1530) \;(\Xi ^*(1530)\rightarrow \pi \Xi \)), and calculate the mass distributions\(\frac{\textrm{d}\Gamma }{\textrm{d}M_\text {inv}(\bar{K}\Xi )}\)and\(\frac{\textrm{d}\Gamma }{\textrm{d}M_\text {inv}(\bar{K}\Xi ^*)}\), respectively. We obtain clear peaks corresponding to the\(\Omega (2012)\). From the decay of\(\psi (3770)\rightarrow \bar{\Omega }^+ \bar{K}\Xi ^*\), we also get a second, broader, peak around\(2035\,\mathrm MeV\), which comes from the\(\Omega (2012)\)decay to\(\bar{K}\Xi ^*\). This second peak is closely tied to the molecular picture of the\(\Omega (2012)\)with the\(\bar{K}\Xi ^*(1530)\)and\(\eta \Omega \)components. Its observation would provide a boost to the molecular picture of the\(\Omega (2012)\).
Starting from a Wheeler–DeWitt type equation for an uncharged black hole\(Q=0\), and by choosing the order parameter\((s=2)\)and running the gravitational degrees of freedom it is possible to reduce the Wheeler–DeWitt equation to the canonical form of a quantum harmonic oscillator. In this direction, a natural frequency of oscillation is identified for the black hole. The entanglement entropy of a pair of interacting quantum black holes of massMis obtained and analyzed. Here we consider as a starting model a pair of identical oscillators of frequency\(\omega \)coupled by a quadratic potential and with interaction constant given by\(\omega _{c}\). Given the relation between the oscillation frequency\(\omega \)of an isolated quantum black hole and its mass, the entanglement entropy of this system is obtained by analogy with a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by a quadratic interaction potential of frequency\(\omega _{c}\). The analysis of the entanglement entropy is performed by introducing the reduced variables\({\widetilde{\omega }}\)and\({\widetilde{A}}\). An interesting result arises when we consider\({\widetilde{A}}\gg 1\)and the interaction parameter is set\({\widetilde{\omega }}=1\). In this case, the entanglement entropy can be replaced by its asymptotic expansion, where the dominant term is of logarithmic character in the reduced area. Another case of analysis emerges when the reduced area\({\widetilde{A}}=1\)and\({\widetilde{\omega }}\)varies. In this case, the entanglement entropy depends uniquely on the interaction parameter between the two black holes.
In the framework of the relativized  quark model, the calculation of spin-orbit interactions is improved by considering the contribution from the light-quark cluster in a singly heavy baryon. It modifies the energy level splitting of the orbital excitation significantly and causes the emergence of fine structures for\(\Sigma _{Q}\),\(\Xi '_{Q}\)and\(\Omega _{Q}\)baryons. Based on this improvement, we systematically analyze the  fine structures and retest the heavy quark dominance mechanism. This mechanism is found to be violated in the 1P-wave states of the\(\Sigma _{c}\),\(\Xi '_{c}\)and\(\Omega _{c}\)baryons although it remains effective overall, which may help to understand the nature of the heavy quarks and strong interactions. With the predicted fine structures, we make the precise assignments of those observed heavy baryons which once could not be accurately explained due to their close mass values. The method used in this work is instructive and applicable for the study of more complex exotic hadrons, such as the heavy tetraquarks and pentaquarks.
In the context of braneworld scenarios, the real scalar field plays a crucial role by providing thickness for brane. In this work, we investigate a codimension-one thick brane within the framework off(R,Q,P) gravity, whereRrepresents the curvature scalar, while\(Q=R_{\mu \nu }R^{\mu \nu }\)and\(P=R_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta }R^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta }\)are quadratic geometric invariants. Our interest  is to investigate the influence of these invariants on the scalar field solution and the energy density of the brane. Furthermore, we analyze the localization of spin 1/2 fermions and the gravitino by employing a Yukawa-like coupling with the scalar field background. Such a coupling is able to produce a normalizable zero-mode for both fields.
Proton–proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011, at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, have been used for an improved determination of theW-boson mass and a first measurement of theW-boson width at the LHC. Recent fits to the proton parton distribution functions are incorporated in the measurement procedure and an improved statistical method is used to increase the measurement precision. The measurement of theW-boson mass yields a value of\(m_W = 80{,}366.5 \pm 9.8~(\text {stat.}) \pm 12.5~(\text {syst.})\)MeV\(= 80{,}366.5 \pm 15.9\)MeV, and the width is measured as\(\Gamma _W = 2202 \pm 32~(\text {stat.}) \pm 34~(\text {syst.})\)MeV\(= 2202 \pm 47\)MeV. The first uncertainty components are statistical and the second correspond to the experimental and physics-modelling systematic uncertainties. Both results are consistent with the expectation from fits to electroweak precision data. The present measurement of\(m_W\)is compatible with and supersedes the previous measurement performed using the same data.
In this work, we calculated the form factors of the weak decay process\(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+\), where the final charm baryon represents an excited state with spin-parity\(\frac{1}{2}^-\). Utilizing the light-cone QCD sum rules approach, we incorporated the contributions of the lowest two charm baryon states: the ground state\(\varLambda _c\)with\(J^P=\frac{1}{2}^+\)and the excited state\(\varLambda _c(2595)^+\)with\(J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-\)in the hadronic representation of the\(\varLambda _b \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+\)transition correlation function. This approach allows us to extract the form factors of the\(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+\)from\(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c^+\)transition. During the light-cone QCD sum rules procedure, we employed the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the\(\varLambda _b\)baryon. Furthermore, by combining these form factors with the helicity amplitudes of the bottom baryon transition matrix elements, we calculated the differential decay widths for the processes\(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+\ell ^-\bar{\nu }_\ell \)and provided the optimal choice of the interpolating current for\(\varLambda _c\)in this process. Additionally, within the lifetime of\(\varLambda _b^0\), we obtained the absolute branching fractions for the semileptonic decays\(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+ \ell ^- \bar{\nu }_\ell \). With the branching fractions of\(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+ \ell ^- \bar{\nu }_\ell \)calculated in this work, we also determined the parameter\(\mathcal {R}(\varLambda _c(2595)^+)\)which tests the lepton flavor universality. This parameter is defined as the ratio of branching fractions\(\mathcal {B}r(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+\tau ^-\bar{\nu }_\tau )\)and\(\mathcal {B}r(\varLambda _b^0 \rightarrow \varLambda _c(2595)^+\mu ^-\bar{\nu }_\mu )\). Our results provide a valuable theoretical test for these decay channels and offer insights into the LCDAs of bottom baryons, paving the way for further in-depth investigations.
We study the\(B^+ \rightarrow D^{*-}D^+K^+\)reaction, showing that a peak in the\(D^+K^+\)mass distribution around\(2834 \text { MeV}\)reported by LHCb could be associated with a theoretical exotic state with that mass, a width of\(19 \text { MeV}\)and\(J^P=2^+\), stemming from the interaction of the\(D^{*+}K^{*+}\)and\(D^{*+}_s \rho ^+\)channels, which is a partner of the\(0^+\)\(T_{c{\bar{s}}}(2900)\). We show that the data is compatible with this assumption, but also see that the mass distribution itself cannot discriminate between the spins\(J=0\), 1, 2 of the state. Then we evaluate the momenta of the angular mass distribution and show that they are very different for each of the spin assumptions, and that the momenta coming from interference terms have larger strength at the resonant energy than the peaks seen in the angular integrated mass distribution. We make a call for the experimental determination of these magnitudes, which has already been used by the LHCb in related decay reactions.
Romano has recently found that frequency modulation of gravitational waves (GWs) could be used as a dark matter probe. Many candidates for dark matter (DM) of various sources have been proposed in the literature.  In this work, we use a teleparallel modified GW model to obtain DM dark torsion from LIGO data, where frequency modulation and frequency bands from various sources of GWs are investigated with regard to their suitability for DM dark torsion detection. In particular, nonhomogeneous and nonuniform chiral chemical potential generates GWs and dark torsion from primordial magnetic fields. It is shown that pulsar sources for GWs bathing the surface of the Earth on a contortion background of\(10^{-15}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}\)possess amplitudes well within the parameters of LIGO capabilities of amplitudes on the order of\(10^{-22}\). GWs are also investigated in the context of having been produced by a primordial magnetic field and inhomogeneity on the chiral chemical potential. The torsion signatures at LIGO correspond to the amplitude dependence of massive torsion by GWs.
We present an analysis of the lepton-flavor violating decay of the Higgs boson mediated by an ultralight gauge boson,\(\chi \). Our analysis matches a model generating the lepton flavor-violating interaction\(\bar{\ell }_i\ell _j\chi \)at tree level with an effective field theory, safeguarding a physical massless\(\chi \)-boson limit of the observables. By utilizing the upper bounds on\(H\rightarrow \ell _i {\bar{\ell }}_j\)decays from CMS and ATLAS Collaborations, we establish an indirect upper limit on the nonstandard decay\(H\rightarrow \ell _i {\bar{\ell }}_j\chi \). The analysis encompasses various observables such as the lepton energy spectrum, Dalitz plot distribution, and Lepton Charge and Forward-Backward Asymmetries.
Matter properties at the intermediate densities are still unknown to us. In this work, we use a neural network approach to study matter at intermediate densities to analyze the variation of the speed of sound and the measure of trace anomaly considering astrophysical constraints of mass–radius measurement of 18 neutron stars. Our numerical results show that there is a sharp rise in the speed of sound just beyond the saturation energy density. It attains a peak around 3–4 times the saturation energy density and, after that, decreases. This hints towards the appearance of new degrees of freedom and smooth transition from hadronic matter in massive stars. The trace anomaly is maximum at low density (surface of the stars) and decreases as we reach high density. It approaches zero and can even be slightly negative at the centre of massive stars. It has a negative trough beyond the maximal central densities of neutron stars. The change in sign of the trace anomaly hints towards a near-conformal matter at the centre of neutron stars, which may not necessarily be conformal quark matter.
We study the Energy Conditions in modified\(f(\mathcal {G})\)gravity, with\(\mathcal {G}\)being the topological Gauss–Bonnet term. Then we use the cosmographic parameters to constrain the functional form of the gravitational action and investigate the possibility to have standard inflation in the early time. Specifically, we select models containing symmetries within the modified\(f(\mathcal {G})\)theory and obtain conditions for which (i) the energy conditions can be violated and (ii) the magnitude of the slow-roll parameters is small, thus suggesting that under given limits the analyzed theory can potentially trace the cosmic history both at early and at the late times.
Raoul Gatto and Bruno Touschek’s collaboration in the establishment of electron–positron colliders as a fundamental discovery tool in particle physics will be illustrated. In particular, we will tell the little-known story of how Gatto and Touschek’s pioneering visions combined to provide the theoretical foundation for AdA, the first matter–antimatter collider, and how their friendship with Wolfgang Pauli and Gerhard Lüders was crucial to their understanding of the CPT theorem, the basis for AdA’s success. We will see how these two exceptional scientists shaped physics between Rome and Frascati, from the proposal to build AdA and soon after the larger machine ADONE in 1961, to the discovery of the\(J/\Psi \)particle in 1974. We will also highlight Gatto and Touschek’s contribution in mentoring an extraordinary cohort of students and collaborators whose work contributed to the renaissance of Italian theoretical physics after the Second World War and to the establishment of the Standard Model of particle physics.
Intrinsic spin of fermions can generate torsion in spacetime. This torsion is a non-propagating field that can be integrated out, leaving an effective non-universal four-fermion interaction. This geometrical interaction affects fermions inside a matter distribution and can be expected to become stronger as the density grows. We investigate the role of this interaction in a gravitationally collapsing fermionic distribution, by considering a statistical average of the interaction term which incorporates the effect of mixed vector and axial currents. We consider a gravitationally collapsing distribution of massive fermions, ignoring other interactions. Using simplified yet reasonable assumptions, we establish that the contribution can be attractive or repulsive depending on how torsion couples with different chiralities. Also, the interaction starts to dominate as the collapse proceeds, accelerating or decelerating the collapse depending on the relative signs of the geometrical interaction between different species of fermions.
We investigate the structure of the minimal left-right symmetric model that enables precise predictions in the gauge, scalar and neutrino sector. We revisit the complete set of mass spectra and mixings for the charged and neutral gauge bosons, would-be-Goldstones and gauge fixing, together with the ghost Lagrangian. In the scalar sector, we analytically re-derive all the massive states with mixings and devise a non-trivial physical input scheme, expressing the model couplings in terms of masses and mixing angles. Fermion couplings are also determined in closed form, including the Dirac mixing in the neutrino sector, evaluated explicitly using the Cayley–Hamilton theorem. These analytic developments are implemented in a comprehensive FeynRules model file. We calculate the one loop QCD corrections and provide a complete UFO file for NLO studies, demonstrated on relevant hadron-collider benchmarks. We provide various restricted variants of the model file with different gauges, massless states, neutrino hierarchies and parity violating\(g_L \ne g_R\)gauge couplings.
We investigate the perturbation of the scalar field as well as the electromagnetic field over a sort of regular black holes which are characterized by the sub-Planckian curvature and the Minkowskian core. Specifically, we compute the quasinormal modes (QNMs) by employing the pseudo-spectral method. The outburst of overtones is manifestly observed in the QNMs of these regular black holes, which can be attributed to the deviation of the Schwarzschild black hole by quantum effects of gravity. Furthermore, the QNMs under the perturbation of electromagnetic field exhibit smaller real and imaginary parts than those under scalar field perturbation. By comparing the QNMs of the regular black hole featured by Minkowskian core with those of Bardeen black hole featured by de Sitter core, we find they may be an effective tool to distinguish these BHs.
We are discussing a scenario where a compact star (neutron star, NS) is embedded in a thin, uniform density background cloud (a remnant cloud after a supernova or a cloud generated from the late stages of a star e.g., a planetary nebula or asymptotic red giant phases) and its effect on the stability of the compact star. Due to the thin background cloud, the spacetime geometry is minimally deformed allowing us to employ the technique of minimal geometric decoupling (MGD). Assuming a uniform background cloud density simplifies the problem, and through the MGD method, one can take\(\Theta ^t_t = \Theta > 0\), where\(\Theta \)is the density of the cloud. The background cloud interacts with the compact star through a coupling strength\(\alpha \). By varying\(\alpha \), one can tune the cloud density to analyze the stability of the embedded compact star. We found that for\(\alpha < 3 \times 10^{-5}\), all the thermodynamic quantities are well-behaved, indicating a stable configuration. Once the coupling parameter exceeds\(3 \times 10^{-5}\), the adiabatic index drops below\(\Gamma _{\text {max}}'\), triggering a gravitational collapse. Beyond this limit of\(\alpha \), the pressure and speed of sound also become non-physical. At the end, we have used the\(M-R\)curve generated from the solution to determine the radii of a few compact stars, namely PSR J1614-2230, PSR J0952-0607, GW190814, and GW200210. Furthermore, we have discussed the possibility of the secondary component of GW200210 i.e. the less massive compact object with an upper mass of\(3.3M_\odot \), which may be a stellar black hole with a Schwarzschild radius\(R_{\text {BH}} = 9.746\)km. However, if the mass is\(2.83M_\odot \)as observed, then its predicted minimum radius is 10.74 km, corresponding to\(\alpha = 0\). This radius is far beyond\(R_{\text {BH}} = 8.357\)km and therefore is most probably a massive NS in the mass gap.
Dyonic black holes with quasitopological electromagnetism exhibit an intriguing phase diagram with two separated first-order coexistence curves. In this paper, we aim to uncover its influence on the black hole thermodynamical topology. At first, we investigate the phase transition and phase diagram of the dyonic black holes. Comparing with previous study that there is no  black hole phase transition region for a middle pressure, we find this region can narrow or disappear by fine tuning the coupling parameter. Instead, two first-order phase transitions can be observed. Importantly, we uncover that such novel phase diagram shall lead to a multiple defect curve phenomenon in black hole topology where each dyonic black hole is treated as one defect in the thermodynamical parameter space. By examining the topology, it is shown that there could be one, three, or five black hole states for given pressure and temperature. For each case, the topological number is calculated. Our results show that the topological number always takes value of\(+1\), keeping unchanged even when the multiple defect curves appear. Therefore, our study provides an important ingredient on understanding the black hole thermodynamical topology.
The Parton Branching method offers a Monte Carlo solution to the DGLAP evolution equations by incorporating Sudakov form factors. In this approach, the Sudakov form factor can be divided into perturbative and non-perturbative components, with the non-perturbative part being analytically calculable under specific conditions. We first examine forward evolution and demonstrate that including soft and non-perturbative gluons (through the non-perturbative Sudakov form factor) is essential for the proper cancellation of divergent terms in parton density evolution. This non-perturbative component is also important for Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) parton distributions, and within the Parton Branching framework, it is constrained by fits to inclusive collinear parton densities. Additionally, we explore the impact of this non-perturbative Sudakov form factor on backward parton evolution and its effects on parton and hadron spectra originating from initial state showers. Our results show that soft and non-perturbative gluons significantly influence inclusive distributions, such as Drell–Yan transverse momentum spectra. However, we found that soft and non-perturbative gluons have a minimal impact on final state hadron spectra and jets.
In view of the recent discovery of\(T_{cc}\), which can be described as a\(DD^*\)molecular state, we perform a study of the\(KDD^*\)system, and its extension to studying\(KD^*D^*\), where\(D^*D^*\)is bound as a spin 1\(T_{cc}\)-like state, to search for the possible existence of exotic mesons with the open flavorsccsbeing part of their quark configuration. Considering the additional attractive interactions present in theKDand\(KD^*\)subsystems, where the states\(D^*_{s0}(2317)\)and\(D_{s1}(2460)\)are generated, we solve the Faddeev equations considering the fixed-center approximation for the mentioned three-body systems and find the existence of two doubly charmed\(K^*\)-like mesons,\(K_{cc}^*(4309)\)and\(K_{cc}^*(4449)\), with quantum numbers\(I(J^P)=1/2\,(1^-)\). Considering the respective three-body thresholds of the two systems, both\(K_{cc}\)-states are bound by around 60 MeV. An experimental confirmation will bring evidence for the existence of a degree of exoticity beyond charm +2.
It is shown that the hadronic phase in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions can be used to understand the properties of the\(f_0(980)\)resonance. In particular it is shown that the centrality dependence of the\(f_0(980)/\pi \)and\(f_0(980)/\phi \)ratios depends strongly on the\(f_0(980)\rightarrow {\overline{K}}+K\)branching ratio and whether the\(f_0(980)\)is produced as a\(\left| {\overline{q}}q \right\rangle \)or\(\left| {\overline{s}}s \right\rangle \)state. These conclusions are drawn from calculations within the partial chemical equilibrium of the HRG model within Thermal-FIST as well as with the fully non-equilibrium hybrid-transport approach UrQMD. Our findings show how the hadronic phase in heavy ion collisions can be used for studies of exotic hadron properties otherwise possible only in dedicated experiments such as PANDA.
We investigate a compelling model of a rotating black hole that is deformed by the effects of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We present a simplified metric and explore two distinct geometries: one in which the masses of the black hole and white hole are equal, and another in which they differ. Our analysis yields the radius of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), as well as the energy and angular momentum of a particle within this framework. Additionally, we find the frequency of the first-order resonance separately. We constrain the model by the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) of the X-ray binary GRO J1655-40. We show that\(\lambda =0.15^{+0.23}_{-0.14}\)at\(1\sigma \)confidence level for equal mass black hole and white hole geometry. For the other geometry we get\(\lambda =0.11^{+0.07}_{-0.07}\)at\(1\sigma \)confidence level. We encounter a degeneracy in the parameter space that hinders our ability to constrain\(\lambda \)with greater precision.
This work studies the periapsis shift in the equatorial plane of arbitrary stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes. Two perturbative methods are systematically developed. The first works for small eccentricity but very general orbit size and the second, which is post-Newtonian and includes two variants, is more accurate for orbits of large size but allows general eccentricity. Results from these methods are shown to be equivalent under small eccentricity and large size limits. The periapsis shift of Kerr–Newman, Kerr–Sen and Kerr–Taub-NUT spacetimes is computed to high orders. The electric charge and NUT charge are shown to contribute to the leading order but with opposite signs. The frame-dragging term and high-order effect of spacetime spin are given. The electric and NUT charges of the Earth, Sun and Sgr A* are constrained using the Mercury, satellite and S2 precession data. Periapsis shifts of other spacetimes are obtained too.

In this study, we investigate the parameterized Konoplya–Rezzolla–Zhidenko (KRZ) black hole (BH) spacetime in the presence of an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field. We first examine the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radii for both neutral and charged test particles, demonstrating that the deformation parameters,\(\delta _1\)and\(\delta _2\), reduce the ISCO values. Subsequently, we assess the energy efficiency of the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) for an axially symmetric parameterized BH, analyzing the effects of the deformation parameters and the magnetic field on the energy extraction process. Our findings indicate that the rotational deformation parameter\(\delta _2\)is crucial for the efficiency of energy extraction from the BH. The synergy between the rotational deformation parameter and the magnetic field significantly boosts the energy extraction efficiency, with values exceeding\(100\%\). Interestingly, for extremal BHs with negative\(\delta _2\)values, the energy efficiency increases, in contrast to Kerr BHs where the MPP effect diminishes. Additionally, we explore the astrophysical implications of the MPP by deriving the maximum energy of a proton escaping from the KRZ parameterized BH due to the beta decay of a free neutron near the horizon. Our results show that negative\(\delta _2\)values require stronger magnetic fields to achieve equivalent energy levels for high-energy protons, providing deeper insights into high-energy astrophysical phenomena around the parameterized BH.
We investigate the screening length of a heavy quark–antiquark (\(Q{\bar{Q}}\)) pair in non-commutative\({\mathcal {N}}=4\)super Yang–Mills plasma at strong coupling. We perform the analysis by computing the Wilson loop in a boosted background and consider the axis of the\(Q{\bar{Q}}\)pair along different directions. It turns out that the inclusion of non-commutativity increases the screening length, thus enhancing the binding energy of the\(Q{\bar{Q}}\)pair. Furthermore, the presence of non-commutativity reduces quarkonium dissociation, in agreement with previous findings of the imaginary potential and entropic force.
We study quantum quenches and subsequent non-equilibrium dynamics of free Dirac fermions in 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions using time dependent mass. The final state is a normalized boundary state which is called generalized Calabrese-Cardy (gCC) state and the system thermalizes to a generalized Gibb’s Ensemble(GGE). We can also tune the initial states so that the final states are exact Calabrese-Cardy (CC) state and special gCC states. The system in the CC state thermalizes to a Gibb’s ensemble. We derive closed-form analytic expressions for the growth of entanglement entropy of subsystems consisting of arbitrary number of disjoint intervals in CC state. We show that the entanglement entropy of a single interval grows monotonically before saturation. In case of certain gCC states, for particular charges, the entanglement entropy of a single interval grows non-monotonically when the effective chemical potential is increased beyond a critical value. We argue that the non-monotonic growth of entanglement entropy is a boundary effect which arises due to increase in long range correlation and decrease in short range correlation at early times.
The detection of molecules on the coldest and outermost objects in our Solar System has long been limited by the terrestrial atmosphere and sensitivity of the available instrumentation. However, near-infrared observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have provided an unprecedented view of the molecular diversity on the surfaces of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Using the low spectral resolution PRISM mode on the near-infrared spectrograph as part of the Cycle 1 large programme, ‘Discovering the Surface Composition of trans-Neptunian objects’, we report the detection of several molecular ices throughout the TNO population, including H2O, CO2,13CO2, CO, CH3OH and complex molecules and refractory materials containing aliphatic C–H, C≡N, O–H and N–H bonds. As a result of the imprint that these molecules leave on the spectra, three main compositional groups consistently emerge from multiple independent cluster analyses. Our results unlock the long-standing question of the interpretation of colour diversity, providing the much-needed compositional information. The marked separation of the three spectral clusters reveals sharp variations in the surface molecular constituents. The C/O and (CH + NH)/(C + O) ratios on the surface of TNOs are the primary indicators of the spectral differences among the three TNO compositional groups observed. We propose that these objects are fossil remnants of icy planetesimals, and that the three compositional groups provide a picture of the ice retention lines in the Solar System that likely occurred in the outer protoplanetary disk, possibly just before a major planetary migration.
Measurements of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) suggest a complex composition with significant  contributions from heavy nuclei at the highest energies. We systematically explore how the selection and number of primary nuclei included in the analysis impact the inferred UHECR mass composition. Introducing a distance measure in the space of\(X_\textrm{max}\)distribution moments, we demonstrate that limiting the analysis to a few primaries can introduce significant biases, particularly as observational data improves. We provide lists of primaries approximately equidistant in the new measure, which guaranty unbiased results at given statistical confidence. Additionally, we explore consistent inclusion of nuclei heavier than iron and up to plutonium, deriving first observational upper bounds on their contributions to UHECR with the Pierre Auger Open Data.
Centaurs are small bodies orbiting between Jupiter and Neptune and behave as an intermediate population between trans-Neptunian-belt objects and Jupiter-family comets. As such, their surface composition and evolutionary processes are key to understanding the Solar System’s history. However, the mechanisms driving their transformation and the impact of thermal processing on their surfaces remain open questions. Here we examined the surface properties of five Centaurs using the James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared spectrograph reflectance spectra (0.6–5.3 μm). They exhibit considerable diversity in surface composition. Our analysis indicates that Centaurs can be split into two main categories, which is also observed for trans-Neptunian objects: one group has surfaces composed of refractory materials with some water ice, whereas the other is dominated by carbon-based materials. Additionally, two of the five objects have primarily refractory surfaces with minimal volatiles, suggesting a high concentration of primitive, comet-like dust. We suggest that the observed Centaur surfaces reflect their transitional states, as they are shifting from being ice-rich bodies to progressively becoming more dominated by non-volatile materials as they approach the Sun. Such thermal processing may have changed the surface properties of other similar Solar System bodies, like comets, Jupiter trojans and D-type asteroids.
The existence of a set of 10 Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries, which acts on three-dimensional hypersurfaces (spacelike or timelike), leads to the existence of two distinct families of 5D geometries. These models represent the general solutions of the bulk field equations where their energy-momentum tensor, includes only two components: a negative cosmological constant and a parallel pressure\(p_{\parallel }\)aligned with the extra spatial dimension. Significantly, these models offer a novel perspective for investigating the impacts of spatial inhomogeneity and anisotropy on the cosmological evolution of the Universe, particularly within the context of the braneworld scenarios. It is shown that one of these families reduces to afully inhomogeneous, anisotropic and conformally flat brane modelwith aperfect fluid equation of stateand corresponds to the Stephani Universe (i.e. a Stephani brane) which implies that our model can be matched smoothly with the standard FRW model. We provide the generalized Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations and we present how the additional quantities could affect the cosmological evolution. In particular we show that the new constituents are the terms\(p_{\parallel }\),\(\sigma ^{2}\)and the four acceleration of the brane observers that could affect the observational measurement of the Hubble parameter depending on which term dominates therefore provide us a potential answer to the Hubble tension and cosmic acceleration problems due to local inhomogeneities and anisotropies.
Relativistic jets are thought to play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of massive galaxies and supermassive black holes. Blazars, which are quasars with jets aligned along our line of sight, provide insights into the jetted population and have been observed up to redshifts ofz= 6.1. Here, we report the discovery and multi-wavelength characterization of the blazar VLASS J041009.05−013919.88 atz= 7 (age of the Universe ~750 Myr), which is powered by a ~7 × 108M⊙black hole. The presence of this high-redshift blazar implies a large population of similar but unaligned jetted sources in the early Universe. Our findings suggest two possible scenarios. In one, the jet in J0410−0139 is intrinsically low power but appears highly luminous due to relativistic beaming, suggesting that most ultraviolet-bright quasars at this redshift host jets. Alternatively, if J0410−0139 represents an intrinsically powerful radio source, there should be hundreds to thousands of radio-quiet quasars atz≈ 7 with properties like those of J0410−0139, a prediction in tension with observed quasar densities based on their ultraviolet luminosity function. These results support the hypothesis that the rapid growth of black holes in the early Universe may be driven by jet-enhanced or obscured super-Eddington accretion, potentially playing a key role in forming massive black holes during the epoch of reionization.
The first James Webb Space Telescope/MIRI photometric observations of TRAPPIST-1 b allowed for the detection of the thermal emission of the planet at 15 μm, suggesting that the planet could be a bare rock with a zero albedo and no redistribution of heat. These observations at 15 μm were acquired as part of Guaranteed Time Observer time that included a twin programme at 12.8 μm to obtain measurements inside and outside the CO2absorption band. Here we present five new occultations of TRAPPIST-1 b observed with MIRI in an additional photometric band at 12.8 μm. We perform a global fit of the ten eclipses and derive a planet-to-star flux ratio and 1σerror of 452 ± 86 ppm and 775 ± 90 ppm at 12.8 μm and 15 μm, respectively. We find that two main scenarios emerge. An airless planet model with an unweathered (fresh) ultramafic surface, that could be indicative of relatively recent geological processes, fits the data well. Alternatively, a thick, pure-CO2atmosphere with photochemical hazes that create a temperature inversion and result in the CO2feature being seen in emission also works, although with some caveats. Our results highlight the challenges in accurately determining a planet’s atmospheric or surface nature solely from broadband filter measurements of its emission, but also point towards two very interesting scenarios that will be further investigated with the forthcoming phase curve of TRAPPIST-1 b.
The total charm-quark production cross section per unit of rapidity\(\textrm{d}\sigma ({{\textrm{c}}\overline{\textrm{c}}})/\textrm{d}y\), and the fragmentation fractions of charm quarks to different charm-hadron species\(f(\textrm{c}\rightarrow {\textrm{h}}_{\textrm{c}})\), are measured for the first time in p–Pb collisions at\(\sqrt{s_\textrm{NN}} = 5.02~\text {Te}\hspace{-1.00006pt}\textrm{V} \)at midrapidity (\(-0.96<y<0.04\)in the centre-of-mass frame) using data collected by ALICE at the CERN LHC. The results are obtained based on all the available measurements of prompt production of ground-state charm-hadron species:\(\textrm{D}^{0}\),\(\textrm{D}^{+}\),\(\textrm{D}_\textrm{s}^{+}\), and\(\mathrm {J/\psi }\)mesons, and\(\Lambda _\textrm{c}^{+}\)and\(\Xi _\textrm{c}^{0}\)baryons. The resulting cross section is\( \textrm{d}\sigma ({{\textrm{c}}\overline{\textrm{c}}})/\textrm{d}y =219.6 \pm 6.3\;(\mathrm {stat.}) {\;}_{-11.8}^{+10.5}\;(\mathrm {syst.}) {\;}_{-2.9}^{+8.3}\;(\mathrm {extr.})\pm 5.4\;(\textrm{BR})\pm 4.6\;(\mathrm {lumi.}) \pm 19.5\;(\text {rapidity shape})+15.0\;(\Omega _\textrm{c}^{0})\;\textrm{mb} \), which is consistent with a binary scaling of pQCD calculations from pp collisions. The measured fragmentation fractions are compatible with those measured in pp collisions at\(\sqrt{s} = 5.02\)and 13 TeV, showing an increase in the relative production rates of charm baryons with respect to charm mesons in pp and p–Pb collisions compared with\(\mathrm {e^{+}e^{-}}\)and\(\mathrm {e^{-}p}\)collisions. The\(p_\textrm{T}\)-integrated nuclear modification factor of charm quarks,\(R_\textrm{pPb}({\textrm{c}}\overline{\textrm{c}})= 0.91 \pm 0.04\;\mathrm{(stat.)} ^{+0.08}_{-0.09}\;\mathrm{(syst.)} ^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\;\mathrm{(extr.)} \pm 0.03\;\mathrm{(lumi.)}\), is found to be consistent with unity and with theoretical predictions including nuclear modifications of the parton distribution functions.
We study the propagation of massless fermionic fields, implementing a family of special functions: Heun functions, in solving the wave equation in three three-dimensional backgrounds, including the BTZ black hole in string theory and Lifshitz black hole solutions in conformal gravity and Hu–SawickiF(R) theory. The main properties of the selected black hole solutions is that their line elements are Weyl related to that of a homogeneous spacetime, whose spatial part possesses Lie symmetry, described by Lobachevsky-type geometry with arbitrary negative Gaussian curvature. Using the Weyl symmetry of massless Dirac action, we consider the perturbation equations of fermionic fields in relation to those of the homogeneous background, which having definite singularities, are transformed into Heun’s equation. We point out the existence of quasinormal modes labeled by the accessory parameter of the Heun function. The distribution of the quasinormal modes has been clarified to satisfy the boundary conditions that require ingoing and decaying waves at the event horizon and conformal infinity, respectively. It turned out that the procedure based on the Heun function, beside reproducing the previously known results obtained via hypergeometric function for the BTZ and Lifshitz black hole solution in conformal gravity, brings up new families of quasinormal frequencies, which can also contain purely imaginary modes. Also, the analysis of the quasinormal modes shows that with the negative imaginary part of complex frequencies\(\omega =\omega _{Re}+i\omega _{Im}\), the fermionic perturbations are stable in this background.
We investigate the impact of incorporating vector-like leptons into the Standard Model, aiming to address longstanding puzzles related to the anomalous magnetic moments of the muon and electron while maintaining consistency with neutrino masses and mixings. We find that among the various representations of vector-like leptons permitted by the Standard Model gauge symmetry, only weak doublets and singlets offer satisfactory solutions, all associated with a significantly constrained parameter space. Our analysis delves into the associated parameter space, identifying representative benchmark scenarios suitable for collider studies. These setups yield a distinctive six-lepton signature whose associated signals can easily be distinguished from the Standard Model background, providing a clear signal indicative of new physics models featuring vector-like leptons. Our work hence sheds light on the potential implications of vector-like leptons in resolving discrepancies inherent to the Standard Model, while also offering insights into experimental avenues for further exploration.
In this paper, the nonfactorizable photonic corrections to the effective four-fermion vertex for the\(\overline{B}\)\({\rightarrow }\)\(D^{({*})}\)\(+\)\({\ell }^{-}\)\(+\)\(\bar{\nu }_{\ell }\)decays are considered at the quark level within SM, where\({\ell }\)\(=\)e,\({\mu }\)and\({\tau }\). It is found that the QED corrections are closely related with the mass of the charged lepton. The QED contributions will enhance branching ratios, which results in the slight reduction of ratios\(R(D^{(*)})\)and the relationship\(R(D^{(*)})_{e}\)<\(R(D^{(*)})_{\mu }\).
A particular extension of Einstein’s General Relativity up to and including quartic terms in the curvature tensor is minimal in the sense that it has a unique maximally symmetric vacuum and only a massless spin-2 excitation in its spectrum around the vacuum. We study the inflation phase of the universe in this minimal quartic extension of Einstein’s gravity in the presence of trace anomaly terms coming from the Standard Model fields and the fields of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We show that the theory allows a quasi-de Sitter phase with sufficiente-foldings.
This work examines the dynamical mass generation for the photon in Rarita–Schwinger QED. We focus our attention on the cases of\(\omega =2,3\)dimensional spacetime. In these frameworks, it is well known that in the usual QED, the photon field (dynamically) acquires a gauge invariant mass (the Schwinger and Chern–Simons mass, respectively). We wish to scrutinize this phenomenon in terms of the Rarita–Schwinger fields. The presence of higher-derivative terms is shown as the leading contributions to the 1PI function\(\langle AA \rangle \)at one-loop order. We study the pole structure of the photon’s complete propagator to unveil the main effects of the Rarita–Schwinger fields on the photon’s mass. In addition, we present some remarks about the renormalizability of this model (in different dimensions) due to the presence of higher-derivative corrections at one-loop.
In this paper, we explore a stationary BTZ space-time within the framework of modified gravity theory, specifically focusing on Ricci-inverse gravity. It is important to clarify that “Ricci-inverse” refers to the inverse of the Ricci tensor, not the Ricci scalar. We consider a general class of this gravity theory, where the functionfis defined by\(f({\mathcal {R}}, {\mathcal {A}}, A^{\mu \nu }\,A_{\mu \nu })\), with\({\mathcal {R}}\)and\({\mathcal {A}}\)representing the Ricci and anti-curvature scalars, respectively and\(A^{\mu \nu }\)is the anti-curvature tensor. We demonstrate that stationary BTZ space-time is a valid solution in this gravity theory, wherein the cosmological constant undergoes modifications due to the coupling constants. Moreover, we study another modified gravity theory known as\(f({\mathcal {R}})\)-gravity and analyze the stationary BTZ space-time. Subsequently, we fully integrate the geodesic equations for BTZ space-time constructed within the Ricci-Inverse gravity, expressing the solutions in terms of elementary functions and compared with the GR result. We classify different types of geodesics, including null and time-like geodesics, under three conditions: (i) nonzero mass and angular momentum,\(M \ne 0, J\ne 0\), (ii) massless BTZ space-time,\(M=0\)and\(J=0\), and (iii)\(M=-1, J=0\), that is\(AdS_3\)-type, and analyze the results in modified gravity theories and compare with the general relativity case.
Neutral current Drell–Yan (DY) lepton-pair production is considered to studyZ-boson quark couplings. Using the open-source fit platformxFitter, we investigate the impact of high-statistics measurements of the neutral current DY (NCDY) forward–backward asymmetry\(A_{\textrm{FB}}\)near the weak boson mass scale in the present and forthcoming stages of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Besides recovering earlier results on the\(A_{\textrm{FB}}\)sensitivity to parton distribution functions, we analyze the precision determination ofZ-boson couplings to left-handed and right-handedu-quarks andd-quarks, and explore Beyond-Standard-Model contributions using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. We perform a sensitivity study and comment on the role of the\(A_{\textrm{FB}}\)asymmetry for the electroweak SMEFT fit and precisionZ-boson physics at the LHC and high-luminosity HL-LHC.
Charmonium production cross-section in proton–proton collisions is measured at the centre-of-mass energy\(\sqrt{s}=13\,\textrm{TeV}\)using decays to\(p\bar{p}\)final state. The study is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\(2.2\,\textrm{fb}^{-1}\)collected in 2018 with the\(\text{ LHCb }\)detector. The production cross-section of the\(\eta _c\)meson is measured in a rapidity range of\(2.0< y < 4.0\)and in a transverse momentum range of\(5.0< p_{\textrm{T}} < 20.0\,\textrm{GeV}\!/\!{ c}\), which is extended compared with previous\(\text{ LHCb }\)analyses. The differential cross-section is measured in bins of\(p_\mathrm{{T}}\)and, for the first time, ofy. Upper limits, at 90% and 95% confidence levels, on the\(\eta _c(2S)\)and\(h_c(1P)\)prompt production cross-sections are determined for the first time.
This paper investigates the structure and stability of wormholes within the framework of Finsler–Barthel–Randers geometry, focusing on the influence of different density models. Finsler geometry, as a generalization of Riemannian geometry, allows for the incorporation of anisotropic characteristics, making it a valuable tool in exploring cosmological phenomena. By employing osculating Riemannian space approaches, we develop wormhole models under non-commutative geometry and power-law energy density distributions. We analyze the role of the Finsler parameter\(\eta \)while evaluating the energy conditions in each model. The specific models developed here with Finsler geometry offer insights into the physical viability of wormholes in this context, potentially resolving some of the longstanding issues in wormhole theory. These findings suggest that Finsler geometry, combined with osculating Barthel–Randers geometry, provides a promising avenue for the construction of stable and physically plausible wormhole structures, The results are validated through analytical solutions and 3-D visualizations, thus contributing to our broader understanding of gravitational physics and spacetime geometry.
This research paper delves into examining the Hayward black hole structure surrounded by quintessence within the framework of Finsler geometry. Our focus centers on the Finsler metric tensor development for black holes. This newly derived metric introduces significant deviations from regular black hole metrics found in general relativity due to the Finslerian term\(\gamma \)presence, thus shedding fresh insights into the geometry and nature of black holes. Our findings reveal that the metric structure aligns closely with known Riemannian limits, affirming the congeniality of our model with existing theories. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to derive critical mass values and determine the normalization factor for the Hayward black hole within the Finlserian framework. The study encompasses a detailed description of the horizons and extremal conditions of the Hayward black hole surrounded by quintessence and the impact of the Finsler parameter\(\gamma \)on them. Specifically, we explore the case where the quintessence state parameter is set to\(\omega = -2/3\). Our analysis delves into the effective potential, providing insights into null geodesics for various energy levels and examining the behavior of horizons by utilizing the definition of the effective potential. We also discuss the impact of\(\gamma \)for the same. We compute and analyze the radius of circular orbits, the period, the instability characteristics of circular orbits, and the force acting on photons with the newly introduced parameter\(\gamma \)within the quintessence field. We have thoroughly looked over the obtained results and discussed them. Additionally, we explore the shadow of the black hole in this context. Thereby, the validity and consistency of our Finslerian model are strengthened. In addition to increasing our understanding of black hole physics, this study paves the way for further research in the Finsler geometry domain and its applications in astrophysics.
In a recent work (Del Piano et al. in Phys Rev D 109(2):024045, 2024), we have described spherically symmetric and static quantum black holes as deformations of the classical Schwarzschild metric that depend on the physical distance to the horizon. We have developed a framework that allows us to compute the latter in a self-consistent fashion from the deformed geometry, in the vicinity of the horizon. However, in this formalism, the distance can be replaced by other physical quantities, e.g. curvature invariants such as the Ricci- or Kretschmann scalar. Here, we, therefore, define a more general framework, which we call aneffective metric description(EMD), that captures the deformed geometry based on a generic physical quantity. We develop in detail the Ricci- and Kretschmann scalar EMD, in particular demonstrating how to compute the geometry in a self-consistent manner. Moreover, we provide explicit relations that allow us to express one EMD  in terms of the others, thus demonstrating their equivalence.
The singularity problem has always been a key focus of physicists’ research. To address this issue, Penrose proposed the cosmic censorship conjecture, with the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (SCCC) being particularly crucial. However, verifying SCCC in different scenarios still faces many challenges. This paper, set against the background of short-hair black holes, explores whether they obey SCCC when subjected to scalar field perturbations. Using the WKB method, Prony method, Lyapunov exponent, and Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), the behavior of a short-hair black hole under different parameter conditions was systematically analyzed. Numerical results indicate that as the charge\( Q \)of the short-hair black hole approaches its extremal value, the SCCC is violated. However, as the order\( k \)of the metric equation and the angular quantum number\( \ell \)increase, the violation of SCCC is delayed. These results suggest that the proximity of the black hole’s charge\( Q \)to its extremal value, along with the size of the angular quantum number\( \ell \)and the order\( k \), play key roles in exploring the physical properties of black holes and verifying SCCC. Finally, research using the WGC shows that when the charge-to-mass ratio in a scalar field meets certain conditions, short-hair black holes can still comply with the SCCC under extreme conditions. This study not only reveals the behavior of short-hair black holes in extreme situations but also offers a new perspective for further exploration of such black holes.
Interest on the possible future scenarios the universe could have has grew substantially with breakthroughs on late-time acceleration. Holographic dark energy (HDE) presents a very interesting approach towards addressing late-time acceleration, presenting an intriguing interface of ideas from quantum gravity and cosmology. In this work we present an extensive discussion of possible late-time scenarios, focusing on rips and similar events, in a universe with holographic dark energy. We discuss these events in the realm of the generalized Nojiri–Odintsov cutoff and also for the more primitive holographic cutoffs like Hubble, particle and event horizon cutoffs. We also discuss the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics and various energy conditions in these regimes. Our work points towards the idea that it is not possible to have alternatives of the big rip consistently in the simpler HDE cutoffs, and shows the flexibility of the generalized HDE cutoff as well.
I study an extended theory of General Relativity that incorporates normalized relativistic velocities, where the boundary terms in the variedf(R)-action are considered as a part of the physical system to be studied. Within this context, I investigate how the classical perturbations can be originated by quantum geometric perturbations, that alters the dynamics of the physical system without perturbations. To do it we use a modified nonlinear quantum algebra recently introduced. The quantum field perturbations of space-time also alter the geodesic equations that describe the dynamics of the relativistic  velocities, the metric tensor and the Ricci tensor. But perhaps the most intriguing of this phenomena is that these space-time alterations change the effective number of space-time dimensions of the system with perturbations includedN(z), in a such manner thatN(z) can take an irrational value\(N(z=2)=8/(1+\sqrt{5})\simeq 2.4721\), when the nonlinear quantum perturbations of space-time are related to the relativistic velocities\(\bar{U}^{\mu }\). To illustrate the theory, we calculate exactly the cosmological parameter in an early inflationary universe.
In this work, we have studied the vector scotogenic model in the context of the dark matter problem. Due to unitarity considerations, we have focused on the scenario with fermion dark matter, finding out that co-annihilations play a fundamental role in achieving dark matter relic abundance. Moreover, the coannihilation effects allow to separate the parameter space into two regions with different phenomenology. In addition, we have studied the detection prospects of these regions separately, focusing on signatures that can appear in lepton flavor violating decays, indirect and direct searches, and the production of these new particles at collider facilities.
Recent conjectures on the complexity of black holes suggest that their evolution manifests in the structural properties of Einstein-Rosen bridges, like the length and volume. The complexity of black holes relates to the computational complexity of their dual, namely holographic, quantum systems identified via the Gauge/Gravity duality framework. Interestingly, the latter allows us to study the evolution of a black hole as the transformation of a qubit collection performed through a quantum circuit. In this work, we focus on the complexity of Einstein-Rosen bridges. More in detail, we start with a preliminary discussion about their computational properties, and then we aim to assess whether an Ising-like model could represent their holographic dual. In this regard, we recall that the Ising model captures essential aspects of complex phenomena such as phase transitions and, in general, is deeply related to information processing systems. To perform this assessment, which relies on a heuristic model, we attempt to describe the dynamics of information relating to an Einstein-Rosen bridge encoded in a holographic screen in terms of dynamics occurring in a spin lattice at low temperatures. We conclude by discussing our observations and related implications.
We construct a new class of\((n+1)\)-dimensional Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions in the presence of the cubic quasitopological gravity for a flat boundary. The related action supports asymptotically Lifshitz solutions by applying some conditions which are used throughout the paper. We have to add a new boundary term and some new counterterms to the bulk action to have finite solutions. Then we define a finite stress tensor complex by which we can calculate the energy density of the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. It is not possible to obtain analytical solutions, and so we use some expansions to probe -the behaviors of the functions, both near the horizon and, at the infinity. Combining the equations, we can attain a total constant along the coordinater. At the horizon, this constant is proportional to the product of the temperature and the entropy and at the infinity, the total constant shows the energydensity of the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. Therefore, we can reach a relation between the conserved quantities temperature, entropy and the energy density and get a smarr-type formula. Using the first law of thermodynamics, we can find a relation between the entropy and the temperature and then obtain the heat capacity. Our results show that the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions are thermally stable for each positive value of the dynamical critiacl exponent,z.
The projected sensitivity of the effective electron neutrino-mass measurement with the KATRIN experiment is below 0.3 eV (90 % CL) after 5 years of data acquisition. The sensitivity is affected by the increased rate of the background electrons from KATRIN’s main spectrometer. A special shifted-analysing-plane (SAP) configuration was developed to reduce this background by a factor of two. The complex layout of electromagnetic fields in the SAP configuration requires a robust method of estimating these fields. We present in this paper a dedicated calibration measurement of the fields using conversion electrons of gaseous\(^\textrm{83m}\)Kr, which enables the neutrino-mass measurements in the SAP configuration.
In order to investigate how the drag force is affected by translational symmetry breaking (TSB), we utilize a holographic model in which the background metric remains translational symmetric while a graviton mass or other fields in the theory break this symmetry. We calculate analytically the drag force, considering an asymptotic\(\hbox {AdS}_5\)in which parameter\(\alpha \)arises from TSB. This parameter can be intuitively understood as a measure of TSB strength and we anticipate that non-zero values of it will affect the drag force. In this asymptotic\(\hbox {AdS}_5\)background, we will demonstrate that a decrease in\(\alpha \)results in a reduction of the drag force. Moreover, we study the diffusion constant, which falls with increasing\(\alpha \). It will eventually be shown that at lower values of\(\alpha \)or\(\mu \)(chemical potential), the transverse diffusion coefficient is larger than the longitudinal one, and the speed of the heavy quark has minimal impact on the ratio.
The polarizabilities of light pseudoscalar mesons can be extracted from differential cross sections for Compton scattering near threshold. While this has been accomplished for charged pions employing Primakoff reactions, a corresponding measurement for kaons will be affected by the presence of the\(K^*(892)\)resonance not too far from threshold. We propose a method to extend the energy range serviceable for this purpose by reconstructing the\(K^*(892)\)contribution model-independently from its\(K\pi \)intermediate state, using dispersion theory. We point out that, in contrast to the charged-pion analog, there is likely no strong hierarchy between sum and difference of electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities; we discuss the sensitivity to disentangling both by improved experimental angular coverage.
The scalar mode describing the fluctuation of the 3-brane (the observable universe) in a five-dimensional bulk spacetime compactified on a circle is absorbed by the Kaluza–Klein U(1) gauge field, leading to a massive brane-vector living on the 3-brane. The brane-vector can be responsible for dark matter because it is odd under a\(\textrm{Z}_2\)symmetry, neutral under the Standard Model (SM) symmetries, and couples extremely weak to the SM particles due to its gravitational origin. Interestingly, the brane-vector dark matter could leave particular imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the primordial gravitational waves. Hence, the precise measurements of the CMB and the observations of the primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation can provide a potential way to probe the extra-dimensions and branes which are the main ingredients of string/M theory.
Examining the\(\phi ^{4}\)and\(\phi ^{8}\)models within a two-dimensional framework in the flat spacetime and embracing a theory with unconventional kinetic terms, one investigates the emergence of kinks/antikinks and double-kinks/antikinks. We devote our study to obtaining the field configurations with minimal energy, i.e., solutions possessing a Bogomol’nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield’s bound. Next, to accomplish our goal, we adopt non-polynomial generalizing functions, namely, hyperbolic sine and cosine functions: the first produce BPS potentials exhibiting a minimum at\(\phi =0\), facilitating the emergence of genuine double-kink-type configurations. Conversely, the second promotes the rise of kink-type solutions.
A search is reported for charge-parity\(CP\)violation in\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} \)decays, using data collected in proton–proton collisions at\(\sqrt{s} = 13\,\text {Te}\hspace{-.08em}\text {V} \)recorded by the CMS experiment in 2018. The analysis uses a dedicated data set that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 41.6\(\,\text {fb}^{-1}\), which consists of about 10 billion events containing a pair of b hadrons, nearly all of which decay to charm hadrons. The flavor of the neutral D meson is determined by the pion charge in the reconstructed decays\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{*+}}} \rightarrow {{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} {{{\mathrm{\uppi }}}^{{+}}} \)and\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{*-}}} \rightarrow {\overline{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} {{{\mathrm{\uppi }}}^{{-}}} \). The\(CP\)asymmetry in\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} \)is measured to be\(A_{CP} ({{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} ) = (6.2 \pm 3.0 \pm 0.2 \pm 0.8)\%\), where the three uncertainties represent the statistical uncertainty, the systematic uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the measurement of the\(CP\)asymmetry in the\({{{\textrm{D}}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\textrm{K}} _{\text {S}}^{{0}}} {{{\mathrm{\uppi }}}^{{+}}} {{{\mathrm{\uppi }}}^{{-}}} \)decay. This is the first\(CP\)asymmetry measurement by CMS in the charm sector as well as the first to utilize a fully hadronic final state.
We propose a consistent framework with theU(1) Peccei–Quinn (PQ) symmetry for obtaining the initial condition for axion kinetic misalignment from inflation. We introduce a PQ complex scalar field and an extra Higgs doublet, which are conformally coupled to gravity, and three right-handed neutrinos for the seesaw mechanism. In the DFSZ type scenarios for the axion, we obtain the PQ anomalies from the Standard Model quarks carrying nonzero PQ charges in some of two Higgs doublet models, solving the strong CP problem by the QCD potential for the axion. Assuming that the PQ symmetry is explicitly violated in the scalar potential by quantum gravity effects, we show that a sufficiently large initial axion velocity can be obtained before the QCD phase transition while avoiding the axion quality problem. As inflation is driven by the radial distance from the origin in the space of scalar fields close to the pole of the kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, we obtain successful inflationary predictions and set the initial axion velocity at the end of inflation. Focusing on the pure PQ inflation with a small running quartic coupling for the PQ field, we discuss the post-inflationary dynamics for the inflaton and the axion. As a result, we show that a sufficiently high reheating temperature can be obtained dominantly from the Higgs-portal couplings to the PQ field, while being consistent with axion kinetic misalignment, the stability for the Higgs fields during inflation and the non-restoration of the PQ symmetry after reheating.
General expressions for one-loop contributions associated with lepton-flavor violating decays of the standard model-like Higgs boson\(h\rightarrow e_b^\pm e_a^\mp \)and gauge boson\(Z\rightarrow e^\pm _b e_a^\mp \)are introduced in the unitary gauge. The results are used to discuss these decays as new physics signals in a minimal left-right symmetric model containing only one bidoublet Higgs and a\(SU(2)_R\)Higgs doublet accommodating data of neutrino oscillations and\((g-2)_{\mu }\). The numerical investigation indicates that some of these decay rates can reach near future experimental sensitivities.
We investigate the effects of a gravitational wave background on the coherence degradation induced by the Unruh effect of a uniformly accelerated single-qubit and quantum interferometric circuit. In both systems, we use the formalism of the evolution of the density matrix of the detector-field system, where after the interaction the field degrees of freedom are traced out to obtain the reduced density matrix of the detector. In this background, we calculate the quantum coherence and interferometric visibility in the long-wavelength regime and large interaction time. Our results indicate that the gravitational wave transfers energy to the internal states of the detector, causing, together with the Unruh effect, changes in them, amplifying the coherence degradation of the system. This amplification occurs when the polarization modes of the gravitational wave are in resonance and have modulated amplitudes. For the case of a short-wavelength, the detector does not respond to the gravitational wave because its oscillation is so fast that the detector does not have time to respond within the system timescale. Therefore, it is possible to detect the signature of gravitational waves in the coherence degradation induced by the Unruh effect within the regimes studied here.
We study supersymmetric solutions of matter-coupledF(4) gauged supergravity in the forms of\(AdS_2\times S^3\)- and\(AdS_3\times S^2\)-sliced domain walls with a non-vanishing two-form field from the supergravity multiplet. These two types of solutions holographically describe conformal line and surface defects within five-dimensional\(N=2\)SCFTs, respectively. In the case of\(SO(3)\times SO(3)\)gauge group obtained by couplingF(4) supergravity to three vector multiplets, we find charged domain wall solutions describing holographic RG flows between two supersymmetric\(AdS_6\)vacua with a running two-form field supporting the line and surface defects. For a particular case of one vector multiplet with\(SO(3)\times U(1)\)gauge group, we find solutions describing RG flows from an\(AdS_6\)vacuum to physically acceptable singular geometries in the presence of defects. This class of solutions can be uplifted to type IIB theory using a consistent truncation obtained fromSO(5, 5) exceptional field theory with half-maximal structures.
The CONUS+experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE\(\nu \)NS) of reactor antineutrinos on germanium nuclei in the fully coherent regime, continuing on this way the CONUS physics program started at the Brokdorf nuclear power plant, Germany. The CONUS+setup is installed in the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland, at a distance of 20.7 m from the 3.6 GW thermal power reactor core. The CE\(\nu \)NS signature will be measured with the same four point-contact high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors produced for the former experiment, however refurbished and with optimized low energy thresholds of about 160\(\hbox {eV}_{ee}\). To suppress the background in the CONUS+detectors, the passive and active layers of the original CONUS shield were modified such to fit better to the significantly changed background conditions at the new experimental location. New data acquisition and monitoring systems were developed. A direct network connection between the experiment and the Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik (MPIK) makes it possible to control and monitor data acquisition in real time. The impact of all these modifications is discussed with particular emphasis on the resulting CE\(\nu \)NS signal prediction for the first data collection phase of CONUS+. Prospects of the planned upgrade in a second phase integrating new larger HPGe detectors are also discussed.
In this work, we study timelike and lightlike geodesics in Kalb–Ramond (KR) gravity around a black hole with the goal of constraining the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameterl. The analysis involves studying the precession of the S2 star periastron orbiting Sgr A* and geodesic precession around the Earth. The ratio of precession frequencies for General Relativity (GR) and KR gravity is computed, with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results providing a parameter range for the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of\(-0.185022 \le l \le 0.060938\). Utilizing the geodesic precession frequency from the Gravity Probe B (GP-B), thelparameter is further constrained to\(-6.30714 \times 10^{-12} \le l \le 3.90708 \times 10^{-12}\), which is consistent with the Schwarzschild limits. Moreover, for timelike geodesics, the innermost circular orbit (ICO) and innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are determined and analyzed to illustrate the impact of the symmetry breaking term. Zoom-whirl obstructions are compared with the Schwarzschild solution. Lower and upper limits of the photon sphere for lightlike geodesics are established to demonstrate the influence of KR gravity on the photon sphere. Additionally, the shadow radius is determined for two observers, one situated at a finite distance from the KR black hole, and the other located at an infinite distance, to constrain the symmetry-breaking parameterl, with comparisons made to EHT results. The bounds forlderived from constraints on the photon sphere radius for lightlike geodesics yield\(-0.0700225 \le l \le 0.189785\)using EHT data. The findings of this paper align with experimental results in the\(l \rightarrow 0\)limit.
AbstractWave trains of magnetic field and ion-flux oscillations generated upstream of the ramp of interplanetary (IP) shock were studied according to BMSW plasma-spectrometer measurements of energy–time spectra of the solar-wind ions supplemented by magnetic-field measurements. It was shown that oscillations of the magnetic field upstream of the ramp of IP shock are accompanied by oscillations of the ion flux. A detailed analysis of two cases is carried out, and the results of statistical study are presented. Right-handed circular or elliptical polarization was observed in all wave trains of magnetic-field oscillations, which is consistent with the characteristics of magnetosonic oscillations corresponding to the low-frequency branch of whistler waves. It was obtained that the mean angles between the propagation direction of whistler waves relative to the magnetic field and shock normal direction were 31° and 40°, respectively. This result suggests that the wave packets upstream of the ramp of IP shock had the properties of propagating whistler waves. It was found that, on average, with an increase in the angle of propagation of whistler waved relative to the shock normal direction θkn, the angle between the wave vector and magnetic-field direction θkBdecreases.
AbstractIn this paper, a preliminary ballistic analysis for an Earth magnetosphere monitoring mission is conducted. Spacecraft mass and propulsion system characteristics are specified to satisfy current technological requirements. Low Earth, Sun-synchronous, and geosynchronous transfer orbits are considered as initial orbits. The target orbits are specified in accordance with scientific tasks. The fuel cost and transfer duration are estimated by two methods: an upper bound from the Lyapunov control method and a lower bound from energy-optimal control problem solution. The relationship between optimal longitudes of the ascending nodes for initial and target orbits is examined. The fuel cost estimates validate the feasibility of the mission based on small spacecraft and on the market low-thrust electric engines.
AbstractMeasurements of heavy (M/q> 3) ions on thePhobos-2satellite revealed that the density of these ions in the central plasma sheet of the areomagnetic tail is proportional to the proton density of the solar wind flowing around the planet.ISEE-2ion measurements in the near-Earth plasma sheet close to the neutral line were also compared to solar wind data obtained on theISEE-3satellite. It was found that the density of protons in the near-Earth plasma sheet is proportional to the density of solar wind protons as well. Analysis of the magnetic and plasma pressure balance in the solar wind and inside the magnetotails of the Earth and Mars showed that the previously found correlations are the result of the necessary equality of pressures at the magnetosphere boundary and inside the magnetic tails of the planets.
We discuss a general prototypical constrained Hamiltonian system with a broad application in quantum field theory and similar contexts where dynamics is defined through a functional action obeying a stationarity principle. The prototypical model amounts to a Dirac–Bergmann singular system, whose constraints restrict the actual dynamics to occur within a differential submanifold, as is the case in the major part of field theoretical models with gauge symmetry. We apply the Dirac–Bergmann algorithm in its full generality unraveling a total of 4msecond-class constraints and obtain the corresponding Dirac brackets algebra in phase space. We follow with the Faddeev–Jackiw–Barcelos–Wotzasek approach in which the geometric character of the mentioned submanifold is emphasized by means of an internal metric function encoding its symplectic properties. We consider two straightforward examples, applying our general results to constrained motion along a toroidal geometry and to a Lorentz violating toy model in field theory. Since toroidal geometry has been recently used in cosmological models, we suggest how our results could lead to different proposals for the shape of the universe in cosmology.
AbstractThe lunar surface in the vicinity of the poles has special properties compared to the surface at the equator and at moderate latitudes. First, the polar regolith contains quite a large amount of water ice, which significantly affects the neutron radiation generated under the influence of galactic cosmic rays. Second, the temperature of the polar regolith can have extremely low values of about 25 K, as a result of which the thermal component of the neutron flux is partially held in the gravitational field. Based on numerical modeling of neutron radiation from the lunar surface, its main features were shown for the polar regions compared to the equatorial ones: a significant decrease in the ratio of epithermal and thermal neutron fluxes due to an increase in the concentration of hydrogen in the regolith, as well as a significant increase in the density of thermal neutrons near the surface due to gravitational capture.
We revisit an economical model for the\(g-2\)anomaly featuring a vector-like charged fermion, a scalar doublet and a scalar singlet in the light of new results from Fermilab. The phenomenological implications for lepton-flavor universality, Higgs decays, and charged lepton-flavor violating decays are discussed in detail.
This paper formulates three different analytical solutions to the gravitational field equations in the framework of Rastall theory by taking into account the gravitational decoupling approach. For this, the anisotropic spherical interior fluid distribution is assumed as a seed source characterized by the corresponding Lagrangian. The field equations are then modified by introducing an additional source which is gravitationally coupled with the former fluid setup. Since this approach makes the Rastall equations more complex, the MGD scheme is used to tackle this, dividing these equations into two systems. Some particular ansatz are taken into account to solve the first system, describing initial anisotropic fluid. These metric potentials contain multiple constants which are determined with the help of boundary conditions. On the other hand, the solution for the second set is calculated through different well-known constraints. Afterwards, the estimated data of a pulsar 4U 1820-30 is considered so that the feasibility of the developed models can be checked graphically. It is concluded that all resulting models show physically acceptable behavior under certain choices of Rastall and decoupling parameters.
Recently, the Belle and LHCb Collaborations have measured the\(\Lambda ^+_c \rightarrow p K^- \pi ^+\)decay and reported the\(K^- p\)invariant mass distribution, which shows a clear cusp structure around the\(\eta \Lambda \)threshold. In this work, we have analyzed this process by considering the triangle mechanism and theS-wave pseudoscalar meson-octet baryon interactions within the chiral unitary approach, which dynamically generates the\(\Lambda (1670)\). Our results are in good agreement with the Belle measurements, which implies that the cusp structure around\(\eta \Lambda \)threshold could be associated with the\(\Lambda (1670)\)with the molecular nature.
AbstractThe study of precipitation of high-energy electrons from the magnetosphere into the Earth’s atmosphere is important for studying the physical mechanisms of electron acceleration during interplanetary disturbances in near-Earth space, the processes of formation of trapped electron fluxes in the magnetosphere and their subsequent precipitation into the atmosphere. In addition, the precipitating electrons affect the spacecraft operation and often lead to significant destruction of mesospheric ozone, etc. Since 1957, the Dolgoprudny Scientific Station of the Lebedev Physical Institute has been conducting continuous measurements of cosmic ray fluxes at altitudes of 0–30 km in the atmosphere of polar latitudes (Murmansk oblast, Antarctica) and at middle latitude (Moscow oblast). During this time, almost 600 cases of electron precipitation were recorded, mainly from the Earth’s outer radiation belt near its polar boundary due to measurement in Murmansk oblast. At the same time, several cases of electron precipitation were recorded at mid-latitude (Moscow oblast) and at the Mirny station in Antarctica, in particular, in 2022–2023. The paper discusses interplanetary and geomagnetic conditions during these events. Analysis of measurement data in the stratosphere made it possible to establish the absorption spectra of secondary bremsstrahlung photons and, on their basis, using the method we developed, to determine the primary energy spectra of precipitating magnetospheric electrons.
AbstractWe reportMagnetospheric Multiscale Mission(MMS) observations of accelerated field-aligned electron beams in the outer (\(\left| {{{B}_{x}}} \right| \sim \left( {10{\kern 1pt} - {\kern 1pt} 20} \right)\,\,{\text{nT}}\)) regions of the Plasma Sheet (PS). TheMMSsatellites were located earthward of the magnetic reconnectionX-line, inside of the bursty bulk flow. The interval corresponds to the growth phase of the substorm. Field-aligned electron beams was produced by electrons suprathermal population with energy\( \sim {\kern 1pt} \left( {1{\kern 1pt} - {\kern 1pt} 5} \right)\,\,{\text{keV}}\). Newly accelerated electron beams are gyrotropic. In the process of evolution, agyrotropy of the beam develops. This leads to the generation of intense (up to ∼80 nA/m2) field-aligned currents. We demonstrate that acceleration of the electrons is pulsed for the time\( < {\kern 1pt} 5\,\,~{\text{s}}\). Propagation of the high-velocity electron beam results in the development of plasma instabilities and generation of a strong (∼59 mV/m) nonideal electric field at frequencies lower than electron cyclotron frequency\({{{{\omega }}}_{{c,e}}}\). The presence of a nonideal electric field leads to the violation of the frozen-in condition of electron plasma and energy dissipation. The energy transformation power density reaches ∼–1000 pW/m3. Fluctuations in the spectrum of a nonideal electric field experience spectral flattering between ion plasma\({{{{\omega }}}_{{p,i}}}\)and electron cyclotron\({{{{\omega }}}_{{c,e}}}\)frequencies. This evidences energy transfer from particles to waves at this spectral range. The studied phenomena may provide significant contributions to the development of turbulence on electronic kinetic scales in the outer region of the PS.
AbstractThe paper considers the problem of ensuring stable radio communication during an Earth–Mars flight using relay satellites. We have analyzed the orbits of relay satellites that are in resonance with the Earth–Mars flight trajectory, which makes it possible to provide a channel of communication with Earth for each mission using such trajectory. A single-stage relay scheme is considered using a regenerative transponder that performs complete processing of the received signal, including demodulation, decoding, subsequent coding, modulation, and transfer to the operating frequency. An independent assessment of power budgets of the communication channels “mission-oriented spacecraft–relay satellite” and “relay satellite–ground receiving network” has been performed. The requirements for the possible regions of the relay satellite positioning in the Earth–Mars flight stage are formulated. Families of resonant orbits providing the given quality of communication on the trajectory of the mission-oriented spacecraft using the relay satellite are defined. The most promising variants of relay satellite orbits have been identified based on the following criteria: the maximum transmitted data during the flight and the maximum data rate at the maximum distance from the Earth.
In this paper, we study the dissociation of heavy quarkonium in the spinning black hole background. Specifically, we analyze the spectral function of charmonium and bottomonium in the spinning black hole background and examine how the angular momentum affects the dissociation of\(J/\Psi \)and\(\Upsilon (1S)\). From the results, we find that the angular momentum and temperature decreases the peak height and expands the peak width of the spectral function, thereby enhancing the dissociation of heavy vector mesons. Moreover, the angular momentum has a stronger dissociation effect in the transverse orientation, revealing the directional influence of angular momentum.
AbstractThe article present a list of realistic scientific goals that can be achieved by the complex of modern plasma instruments onboard theVenera-Dspacecraft. Structures and operating principles of three plasma instruments—an ion energy–mass analyzer, electron spectrometer, and energetic neutral-atom detector—are also presented.
AbstractBased on ground-based observations of cosmic rays (CRs) on the global network of neutron monitors, the Yakutsk complex of muon telescopes, and the URAGAN muon hodoscope (Moscow), the spectra of CR variations and anisotropy during the Forbush effects of March 15 and 23, 2023 were calculated using the spectrographic global survey method. It is shown that the spectrum of CR variations during these periods is not described by a power function in a wide range of rigidities. It was found that the Earth was in a loop-shaped structure of the interplanetary magnetic field on March 15 and that it entered a magnetic cloud with closed field lines on March 23.
AbstractThe existence of continuous cooling and heating processes is an important condition governing the behavior of the solar corona, which is characterized by temperatures of several million Kelvin. These processes can be significantly influenced by small-scale coronal formations, which largely determine the thermal balance of the corona and solar-wind disturbances. High-sensitivity observations of polarized radiation allow us to evaluate the complex structure of magnetic fields that accumulate the energy necessary to excite coronal eruptions, bursts and flares. However, at high altitudes the corona becomes optically thin, and observations of it pose a major challenge, requiring the use of instruments with a large effective area. Many researchers note that the emerging field of coronal magnetometry is hard to develop due to the fact that experimental observations in optical range are limited by the low plasma density in the corona, high temperature, and insufficient sensitivity of the instruments. In contrast, higher sensitivity is achievable in the radio frequency range. In particular, the 1–3 GHz range is optimal for detecting very weak coronal structures of emerging activity, despite limitations in spatial resolution. To carry out radio requency observations of the corona on the RATAN-600 large reflector-type radio telescope, a wide-range spectrometer in the range of 1–3 GHz was created. It has continuous coverage of the entire frequency range with maximum frequency and time resolutions, as well as high sensitivity to radiation flux. The results of the first series of observations of weak coronal structures are presented, and their interpretation in terms of their effect on thermal processes in the corona is discussed.
AbstractMMSfour-spacecraft observations with high temporal and spatial resolution made it possible to study the characteristics of intense superthin current sheets (SCSs) with a current densityJ> 30 nA/m2, formed in bursty bulk flows (BBFs), propagating in the Plasma Sheet (PS) of the magnetotail from the remoteXline. Statistical analysis of >1000 SCSs observations showed that, in the majority of cases, the current in the SCSs is parallel to the ambient magnetic field and is carried by field-aligned accelerated electron beams. The half-thickness of the SCSs is several electron gyroradii, and in such thin layers the electric current is carried by demagnetized electrons. Bursts of strong nonideal electric fieldsE' > 10 mV/m are often observed at the edges and/or inside the SCSs. The generation of such fields brings about energy conversion in the SCSs of hundreds of pW/m3, and in some cases up to several nW/m3, which is comparable to the energy conversion in the electron diffusion region of magnetic reconnection. The strongest energy release is observed in the SCSs formed in the fastest BBFs and under strong variations of the magnetic field in the tail lobes.
AbstractThe article presents a brief description of the main scientific objectives of the Solntse–Terahertz project. As part of this project, the Lebedev Physical Institute is manufacturing scientific equipment for installation on the Russian segment of theInternational Space Station. The optical system of each of the eight scientific equipment’s radiation receivers consists of a system of mirrors, an optical chopper, low-pass and bandpass filters. Spectral characteristics were obtained for each element of this system. When calibrating the device, a source—a black-body simulator (BBS)—is used, and, therefore, using numerical integration methods, the intensity of radiation from the BBS that passes through the filter system was calculated. To estimate the characteristic signal from the quiet Sun, the radiation intensity passing through the filter system was calculated using numerical integration methods using the standard ASTM E-490 solar spectrum.
In this paper, we study the scalar and Dirac fields perturbation of Schwarzschild-de Sitter-like black hole in bumblebee gravity model. The effective potentials, greybody factors and quasinormal modes of the black hole are investigated by using the Klein–Gordon equation and Dirac equation. To compute the greybody factors for scalar and Dirac fields, we use the general method of rigorous bound. We also investigate the quasinormal mode using the third order WKB approximation method and Pöschl–Teller fitting method. The impact of Lorentz invariance violation parameterLand cosmological constant\(\varLambda \)to the effective potential, greybody factors and quasinormal modes are analyzed for different modes. Increasing the parameters\(\varLambda \)andLlower the effective potentials and consequently increases the rigorous bound on the greybody factors. Our findings show that the oscillation frequency and the damping rate decrease with increasingL. We analyze the Hawking temperature, power spectrum and sparsity of Hawking radiation. Both the peak of power spectrum and total power emitted decrease with increasingL. The effect ofLon the shadow radius is also discussed.
We present a simple toy model of cosmic acceleration driven purely by a self-interacting scalar field embedded in theory of grand unification. The scalar self-interaction is Higgs-like and provokes a spontaneous symmetry breaking. The coefficient of the quadratic term in the self-interaction potential has an evolution and it leads to a cosmic variation of proton-to-electron mass ratio,\(\mu \). We perform a cosmological reconstruction from the kinematic parameter jerk and discuss a few cosmological consequences of the theory. We also compare the theoretically calculated\(\mu \)variation with the observations of molecular absorption spectra from Cesium Atomic Clock data.
The Tolman–Ehrenfest criterion for the thermal equilibrium of a fluid at rest in a static general-relativistic geometry is generalized to scalar–tensor gravity. Surprisingly, the gravitational scalar field, which fixes the strength of the effective gravitational coupling, does not play a role in determining thermal equilibrium. As a result, heat does not sink more in a gravitational field where gravity is stronger.

In this study, the canonical quantization of the U(1) gauge field in the Lorentz-covariant gauge in the right Rindler-wedge (RRW) of the four-dimensional Rindler coordinates is performed. Specifically, we obtain the gauge-fixed Lagrangian by the Lorentz-covariant gauge in the RRW of the Rindler coordinates, which is composed of the U(1) gauge field andB-field. Then, we obtain the mode-solutions of the U(1) gauge field andB-field by solving the equations of motion obtained from that gauge-fixed Lagrangian. Subsequently, defining the Klein–Gordon inner-product in the RRW of the Rindler coordinates, we determine the normalization constants of all directions of the mode-solutions of the U(1) gauge field andB-field. Then, for the U(1) gauge field given by those normalized mode-expanded solutions, we obtain the commutation relations of the creation and annihilation operators defined in the RRW of the Rindler coordinates by formulating the canonical commutation relations. In addition, we provide a polarization vector for the annihilation operators obtained in this way. Using these result, we show that the Minkowski ground state can be expressed as the outer-product of the left and right Rindler-wedges state on which those creation and annihilation operators act. Then, tracing out the left Rindler states of that Minkowski ground state, we obtain the density matrix of the U(1) gauge field in the RRW. From this, we show that the U(1) gauge field in a constant accelerated system will feel the Unruh temperature as well.
A novel nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) model with two dimensionful parameters is introduced and investigated. Our model obeys the Maxwellian limit and exhibits behaviour similar to the Born–Infeld Lagrangian in the weak field limit. It is shown that the electric field of a point charge in this model has a definite maximum value. Thus, the self-energy of the point charge is finite. The phenomenon of vacuum birefringence is found to occur in the presence of an external uniform electric field. Causality and unitarity conditions for all background electric fields hold, whereas, for magnetic fields, a restricted domain of validity is found. Moreover, a minimal coupling of Einstein’s General Relativity (GR) with this NLE results in solutions of regular black holes or naked singularities, depending on whether the source is a nonlinear magnetic monopole or an electric charge, respectively.
One of the possible ways to test gravity theories and get constraints on parameters of a gravity theory and a black hole is based on studies of black hole shadow applying Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data from the shadow sizes of M87* and Sgr A*. In this sense, we study the shadow of rotating charged black holes in Einstein–Maxwell scalar (EMS) theory. First, we obtain a rotating EMS black hole solution and analyze the horizon properties. We derive the effective potential for the circular motion of photons along null geodesics around the rotating black hole and obtain the black hole shadow using celestial coordinates. The effects of the black charge and spin and EMS theory parameters on the shape of the black hole shadow, its radius, and distortion parameters are analyzed in detail. We have obtained upper and lower limits for spin and black hole charges of Sgr A* and M87* using their shadow size for various values of EMS parameters. Lastly, we computed and examined the standard shadow radius, equatorial, and polar quasinormal modes using the geometric-optic relationship between the parameters of the quasinormal mode and the conserved values along the geodesics.
Venus’s climatic history provides powerful constraints on the location of the inner edge of the liquid-water habitable zone. However, two very different histories of water on Venus have been proposed: one where Venus had a temperate climate for billions of years with surface liquid water and the other where a hot early Venus was never able to condense surface liquid water. Here we offer a constraint on Venus’s climate history by inferring the water content of its interior. By calculating the present rate of atmospheric destruction of H2O, CO2and OCS, which must be restored by volcanism to maintain atmospheric stability, we show that Venus’s interior is dry. Venusian volcanic gases have at most a 6% water mole fraction, which is substantially drier than terrestrial magmas degassed at similar conditions. The dry interior is consistent with Venus ending its magma ocean epoch desiccated and thereafter having had a long-lived dry surface. Volcanic resupply to Venus’s atmosphere, therefore, indicates that the planet has never been liquid-water habitable.
Spontaneous scalarization in Einstein-scalar-Gauss–Bonnet theory admits both vacuum-general relativity (GR) and scalarized hairy black holes as valid solutions, which provides a distinctive signature of new physics in strong gravity regime. In this paper, we shall examine the optical features of Gauss–Bonnet black holes with spontaneous scalarization, which is governed by the coupling parameter\(\lambda \). We find that the photon sphere, critical impact parameter and innermost stable circular orbit all decrease as the increasing of\(\lambda \). Using observable data from Event Horizon Telescope, we establish the upper limit for\(\lambda \). Then we construct the optical appearances of the scalarized black holes illuminated by various thin accretions. Our findings reveal that the scalarized black holes consistently exhibit smaller shadow sizes and reduced brightness compared to Schwarzschild black holes. Notably, in the case of thin spherical accretion, the shadow of the scalarized black hole is smaller, but the surrounding bright ring is more pronounced. Our results highlight the observable features of the scalarized black holes, providing a distinguishable probe from their counterpart in GR in strong gravity regime.
By employing modified Chaplygin fluid prescription for the dark energy, we construct slowly rotating isotropic and anisotropic dark energy stars. The slow rotation is incorporated via general relativistic Hartle–Thorne formalism; whereas the anisotropy is introduced through Bowers–Liang prescription. We consider both the monopole and quadrupole deformations and present a complete analysis of rotating dark energy stars. By numerically solving the rotating stellar structure equations in presence of anisotropy, we analyse and quantify various properties of dark energy stars such as mass (M), radius, mass deformation, angular momentum (J), moment of inertia, and quadrupole moment (Q), for three different equation of state parameters. We find that anisotropic slow rotation results in significant deformation of stellar mass and thereby affects other global properties studied. For the values of angular frequencies considered, the effect of anisotropy on the stellar structure is found to be more prominent than that due to rotation. The dimensionless quadrupole moment\(QM/J^2\)measuring deviation from a Kerr metric black hole was obtained for anisotropic dark energy stars. We observe that dark energy stars with higher anisotropic strength tend to approach the Kerr solution more closely. We report that our results have considerable agreement with various astrophysical observational measurements. We also find that the dimensionless quadrupole moments of anisotropic dark energy stars corresponding to the canonical mass\({\bar{q}}_{1.4}\)have a similar range of values as that of isotropic neutron stars and strange stars.
Quantum coherence, a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, plays a crucial role in various quantum information tasks. However, preserving coherence under extreme conditions, such as relativistic acceleration, poses significant challenges. In this paper, we investigate the influence of Unruh temperature and energy levels on the evolution of maximal steered coherence (MSC) for different initial states. Our results reveal that MSC is strongly dependent on Unruh temperature, exhibiting behaviors ranging from monotonic decline to non-monotonic recovery, depending on the initial state parameter\(\Delta _0\). Notably, when\(\Delta _0=1\), MSC is generated as Unruh temperature increases. Additionally, we observe that higher energy levels help preserve or enhance MSC in the presence of Unruh effects. These findings offer valuable insights into the intricate relationship between relativistic effects and quantum coherence, with potential applications in developing robust quantum technologies for non-inertial environments.
In various fields of mathematical research, the Brouwer degree is a potent tool for topological analysis. By using the Brouwer degree defined in one-dimensional space, we interpret the equation of state for temperature in black hole thermodynamics,\(T=T(V,x_i)\), as a spinodal curve, with its derivative defining a new functionf. The sign of the slope offindicates the topological charge of the black hole’s critical points, and the total topological charge can be deduced from the asymptotic behavior of the functionf. We analyze a spherical hairy black hole within the framework of Lovelock gravity, paying particular attention to the topological structure of black hole thermodynamics under Gauss–Bonnet gravity. Here, the sign of the scalar hair parameter influences the topological classification of uncharged black holes. When exploring the thermodynamic topological properties of hairy black holes under cubic Lovelock gravity, we find that the spherical hairy black hole reproduces the thermodynamic topological classification results seen under Gauss–Bonnet gravity.
An extension of thexFitteropen-source program for QCD analyses is presented, allowing for a polynomial parameterization of the dependence of physical observables on theoretical parameters. This extension enables simultaneous determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and new physics parameters within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The functionalities of the code are illustrated in a sensitivity study, where a simultaneous determination of the PDFs, top quark mass and the couplings of selected dimension-6 SMEFT operators is addressed using projections for measurements of top quark-antiquark pair production at the High-Luminosity LHC. The importance of considering all the correlations of the parton distributions, top quark mass and the SMEFT parameters in a simultaneous QCD+SMEFT analysis is demonstrated. This work serves as a new platform for simultaneous extraction of the PDFs and the SM/SMEFT parameters based onxFitter.
We propose extended 3HDM and 4HDM models where the SM gauge symmetry is enlarged by the spontaneously broken\(S_4\)group, the preserved\(Z_2\)and broken\(Z_4\)cyclic symmetries. Each model has three activeSU(2) scalar doublets, in addition, the first one has an extra inert scalar singlet, whereas the second model has an inert scalar doublet. Furthermore, each model has several extra gauge singlet scalars, which are triplets under\(S_4\). Both models yield the same structure of the mass matrices for the fermion sector, where a radiative seesaw generates the tiny light active neutrino masses at one-loop level, through the\(S_4\)triplets. The presence of flavor changing neutral currents mediated by heavy scalars allowed us to study the\((K^0-\overline{K}^0)\)and\((B_{d,s}^0-\overline{B}_{d,s}^0)\)meson mixings, in the parameter space that currently satisfies the experimental constraints. On the other hand, due to the preserved\(Z_2\)symmetry, our proposed models have stable scalar and fermionic dark matter candidates. Furthermore, these models are consistent with the current pattern of SM fermion masses and mixings, with the measured dark matter relic abundance and successfully accommodate the constraints arising from meson oscillations and oblique parameters. The extra scalars in our models provide radiative corrections to the oblique parameters, where due to the presence of the scalar inert doublet, renders the 4HDM less restrictive than the 3HDM one.
The gravitational field around an astrophysical black hole (BH) is thought to be described by the Kerr spacetime, which is a solution of the Einstein equation. Signatures of binary black hole (BBH) coalescence in gravitational waves (GW) follow the Kerr spacetime as the theoretical foundation. Hence, any possible deviations from the Kerr spacetime around BHs serve as a test of the nature of gravity in the strong-field regime and of the predictions of General Relativity. In our study, we perform a theory-agnostic test of the Kerr hypothesis using BBH inspirals from the third Gravitational-wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). Considering the Johannsen metric, we compute the leading-order deviation to the emitted GW in the frequency domain. Our results provide constraints on two deformation parameters (\(\alpha _{13}\)and\(\epsilon _3\)) and demonstrate the degeneracy between these two non-Kerr parameters.
In the present work, we propose to explore the productions of the bottom and bottom-strange mesons in the high-energy pion and kaon-induced reactions on a proton target. The cross sections are evaluated with an effective Lagrangian constructed by the heavy-quark limit and chiral symmetry. Our estimations show that at\(P_\pi =80\)GeV, the cross sections forB(5279),\(B^*(5325)\),\(B_0^*(5722)\),\(B_1^\prime (5716)\),\(B_1(5721)\)and\(B_2^*(5747)\)production processes are estimated to be 3.19–86.26, 1.86–51.29, 0.88–24.33, 0.86–23.69, 162.35–4477.66, and 57.16–1604.43 nb, respectively, where uncertainties arise from the model parameter. In addition, the cross sections for the corresponding bottom-strange mesons production processes are very similar. From the heavy quark effective theory point of view, the ratios between the cross sections for bottom mesons and bottom-strange mesons should be similar and the present estimations are consistent with the expectation of heavy quark limit. In particular, the cross-section ratios related to the states in the same doublets are of order one. The cross sections related to the states in theTdoublets are about two orders larger than those related to the states in theSdoublets.
The regime of dark matter (DM) freeze-in at stronger coupling interpolates between freeze-in and freeze-out. It relies on Boltzmann-suppressed dark matter production, implying that the Standard Model bath temperature never exceeds the dark matter mass. In this work, we study this regime in the context of sterile neutrino dark matter, which can be sufficiently long-lived for a tiny sterile-active mixing. The sterile neutrino is assumed to couple to a real singlet scalar, providing for a thermal production mechanism of the former. We find that DM mass can range from GeV to tens of TeV consistently with all the constraints. The most interesting aspect of the consequent freeze-in phenomenology is that the sterile neutrino dark matter can be probed efficiently by both direct detection experiments and invisible Higgs decay at the LHC.
In this paper we investigate the shear viscoelasticity and the hydrodynamic modes in a holographic solid model with several sets of axions that all break the translations spontaneously on boundary. Comparing with the single-axion model, the shear modulus is enhanced at high temperatures and the shear viscosity is always suppressed in the presence of additional axions. However, the different sets of axions exhibit competitive relationship in determining the shear modulus at low temperatures. Furthermore, by calculating the black hole quasi-normal modes, it is found that adding more axions only increases the amount of diffusive modes. The number of the sound modes always remains unchanged.
This research paper investigates the impact of non-metricity and matter source on the geometry of charged spheres in the presence of anisotropic matter configuration. We use a specific model of extended symmetric teleparallel theory to minimize the complexity of the field equations. Moreover, the feasible non-singular solutions are used to examine the interior composition of the charged spheres. The Darmois junction conditions are used to determine the unknown constants in the metric coefficients. We explore some significant properties in the interior of compact stars under consideration to check their viable existence in this modified framework. The equilibrium state of the charged spheres is discussed using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation and stability is analyzed by sound speed and Herrera cracking approach. We find that the charged spheres in this theoretical framework are physically viable and stable.
In order to search for new solutions for collapsed objects in quantum gravity, we consider in this paper a Kantowski–Sachs metric labelled by parameters that have no classical significance. In addition, we include a Klein–Gordon field to represent in a simple manner the inevitable zero-point vacuum fluctuations that permeate the spacetime. With this framework, we quantize the system and obtain the Wheeler–DeWitt equation in order to focus upon the deep quantum regime of the interior and to analyze any kind of transition that the black hole may undergo. The Wheeler–DeWitt equation reveals the existence of new solutions of different nature, designated herein as “quantum grey holes,” in addition to the existence of quantum black holes, with all solutions satisfying the DeWitt boundary condition. The existence of new solutions gives rise to the novel possibility of a quantum black hole making a transition to a quantum grey hole. We find that there exists non-zero probability of quantum black-to-grey hole transition. These transition probabilities exhibit resonances for a continuous range of eigenvalues of the system.
Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, as suggested by recent observations, seems to challenge this model, as such galaxies would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars. However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshiftz= 4.90, 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal that the stellar mass of the galaxy of 1011M⊙formed in a short 200 Myr burst of star formation, after which star formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than assumed at present.
In the present work we determine the eight form factors of the transversely-projected quark-gluon vertex in general kinematics, in the context of Landau-gauge QCD with two degenerate light dynamical quarks. The study is based on the set of Schwinger–Dyson equations that govern the vertex form factors, derived within the formalism of the three-particle-irreducible (3PI) effective action. The analysis is performed by employing lattice data for the main ingredients, such as gluon and quark propagators, and three-gluon vertex. The numerical treatment is simplified by decoupling the system of integral equations: the classical form factor is determined from a single non-linear equation involving only itself, while the remaining ones are subsequently computed through simple integrations. The form factors are obtained for arbitrary values of space-like momenta, and their angular dependence is examined in detail. A clear hierarchy is established at the level of the corresponding dimensionless effective couplings, in agreement with results of earlier studies. Furthermore, the classical form factor is found to be in excellent agreement with recent unquenched lattice data in the soft-gluon configuration, while the two non-classical dressings depart substantially from the lattice results. Finally, the accurate implementation of multiplicative renormalizability is confirmed, and the transition from Minkoswski to Euclidean space is elucidated.
Recently, the short-distance asymptotics of the generating functional ofn-point correlators of twist-2 operators in SU(N) Yang–Mills (YM) theory has been worked out in Bochicchio et al. (Phys Rev D 108:054023, 2023). The above computation relies on a basis change of renormalized twist-2 operators, where\(-\gamma (g)/ \beta (g)\)reduces to\(\gamma _0/ (\beta _0\,g)\)to all orders of perturbation theory, with\(\gamma _0\)diagonal,\(\gamma (g) = \gamma _0 g^2+\cdots \)the anomalous-dimension matrix and\(\beta (g) = -\beta _0 g^3+\cdots \)the beta function. The construction is based on a novel geometric interpretation of operator mixing (Bochicchio in Eur Phys J C 81:749, 2021), under the assumption that the eigenvalues of the matrix\(\gamma _0/ \beta _0\)satisfy the nonresonant condition\(\lambda _i-\lambda _j\ne 2k\), with\(\lambda _i\)in nonincreasing order and\(k\in {\mathbb {N}}^+\). The nonresonant condition has been numerically verified up to\(i,j=10^4\)in Bochicchio et al. (Phys Rev D 108:054023, 2023). In the present paper we provide a number theoretic proof of the nonresonant condition for twist-2 operators essentially based on the classic result that Harmonic numbers are not integers. Our proof in YM theory can be extended with minor modifications to twist-2 operators in\(\mathcal {N}=1\)SUSY YM theory, large-NQCD with massless quarks and massless QCD-like theories.
Complex quantum information tasks in a gravitational background require multipartite entanglement for effective processing. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the properties of multipartite entanglement in a relativistic setting. In this paper, we study genuine N-partite entanglement of massless Dirac fields in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, characterized by the presence of a black hole event horizon (BEH) and a cosmological event horizon (CEH). We obtain the general analytical expression of genuine N-partite entanglement shared bynobservers near BEH andm(\(n+m=N\)) observers near CEH. It is shown that genuine N-partite entanglement monotonically decreases with the decrease of the mass of the black hole, suggesting that the Hawking effect of the black hole destroys quantum entanglement. It is interesting to note that genuine N-partite entanglement is a non-monotonic function of the cosmological constant, meaning that the Hawking effect of the expanding universe can enhance quantum entanglement. This result contrasts with multipartite entanglement in single-event horizon spacetime, offering a new perspective on the Hawking effect in multi-event horizon spacetime.
A sizable fraction of the heavy elements synthesized by stars in galaxies condenses into submicrometre-sized solid-state particles known as dust grains. Dust produces a wavelength-dependent attenuation,Aλ, of the galaxy emission, thereby substantially altering its observed properties. Locally,Aλis in general the sum of a power law and a ultraviolet feature (‘bump’) produced by small, carbon-based grains. However, scant information exists regarding its evolution across cosmic time. Here, leveraging data from 173 galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope in the redshift rangez= 2–12, we report the detection of the ultraviolet bump in az≈ 7.55 galaxy (when the Universe was only ~700 Myr old) and show that the power-law slope and the bump strength decrease towards high redshifts. We propose that the flatAλshape at early epochs is produced by large grains newly formed in supernova ejecta, which act as the main dust factories at such early epochs. Importantly, these grains have undergone minimal reprocessing in the interstellar medium due to the limited available cosmic time. This discovery offers crucial insights into the redshift-dependent evolution of dust attenuation properties, shedding light on the role of supernovae-driven dust production, grain size distribution at early cosmic times and the processes driving dust evolution at later epochs.
We derive a class of Taub-NUT metrics in the presence of a scalar field (TNS) by using Ernst equations and potential, as well as using Ehlers transformations on the exact solutions that was recently introduced in Azizallahi et al. Nucl Phys B and Mirza et al. (Eur Phys J C. Furthermore, we investigate the effective potential, geodesics, topological charge, quasinormal modes (QNMs) and the deflection angle of light in a gravitational lensing for the obtained class of TNS metrics. We also use conformal transformations to generate a new class of exact solutions of the Einstein-conformal-scalar theory by using the obtained TNS solutions as seed metrics. Finally we compare QNMs of the class of exact solutions.
The standard cosmological model, based on Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy (\(\varLambda \)CDM), faces several challenges. Among these is the need to adjust the scenario to account for the presence of vast voids in the large-scale structure of the universe, as well as the early formation of the first stars and galaxies. Additionally, the observed matter–antimatter asymmetry in the universe remains an unresolved issue. To address this latter question, Andrei Sakharov proposed a twin universe model in 1967. Building upon this idea and introducing interactions between these two universe sheets through a bimetric model, we propose an alternative interpretation of the large-scale structure of the universe, including its voids and the acceleration of cosmic expansion.
This Letter proposes a new signature for confining dark sectors at the LHC. Under the assumption of a QCD-like hidden sector, hadronic jets containing stable dark bound states originating from hidden strong dynamics, known as semi-visible jets, could manifest in proton-proton collisions. In the proposed simplified model, a heavy\(Z'\)mediator coupling to SM quarks allows the resonant production of dark quarks, subsequently hadronizing in stable and unstable dark bound states. The unstable dark bound states can then decay back to SM quarks via the same\(Z'\)portal or photons via a lighter pseudo-scalar portal (such as an axion-like particle). This mechanism creates a new signature where semi-visible jets are enriched in non-isolated photons. We show that these exotic jets evade the phase space probed by current LHC searches exploiting jets or photons due to the expected high jet neutral electromagnetic fraction and photons candidates non-isolation, respectively. In the proposed analysis strategy to tackle such signature, we exploit jets as final state objects to represent the underlying QCD-like hidden sector. We show that, by removing any selection on the neutral electromagnetic fraction from the jet identification criteria, higher signal efficiency can be reached. To enhance the signal-to-background discrimination, we train a deep neural network as a jet tagger that exploits differences in the substructure of signal and background jets. We estimate that with the available triggers for Run 2 and this new strategy, a high mass search can claim a\(5 \sigma \)discovery (exclusion) of the\(Z'\)boson with a mass up to 5 TeV (5 TeV) with the full Run 2 data of the LHC when the fraction of unstable dark hadrons decaying to photons pairs is around\({30}{\%}\), and with a coupling of the\(Z'\)to SM quarks of 0.25.
The origin of tiny neutrino mass is an unsolved puzzle leading to a variety of phenomenological aspects beyond the Standard Model (BSM). We considerU(1) gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM) where so-called seesaw mechanism is incarnated with the help of thee generations of Majorana type right-handed neutrinos followed by the breaking ofU(1) and electroweak gauge symmetries providing anomaly free structure. In this framework, a neutral BSM gauge boson\(Z^\prime \)is evolved. To explore the properties of its interactions we consider chiral (flavored) frameworks where\(Z^\prime \)interactions depend on the handedness (generations) of the fermions. In this paper we focus on\(Z^\prime \)-neutrino interactions which could be probed from cosmic explosions. We consider\(\nu \overline{\nu } \rightarrow e^+ e^-\)process which can energize gamma-ray burst (GRB221009A, so far the highest energy) through energy deposition. Hence estimating these rates we constrainU(1) gauge coupling\((g_X)\)and\(Z^\prime \)mass\((M_{Z^\prime })\)under Schwarzchild (Sc) and Hartle-Thorne (HT) scenarios. We also study\(\nu \)-DM scattering through\(Z^\prime \)to constrain\(g_X-M_{Z^\prime }\)plane using IceCube data considering high energy neutrinos from cosmic blazar (TXS0506+056), active galaxy (NGC1068), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and the Lyman-\(\alpha \)data, respectively. Finally highlighting complementarity we compare our results with current and prospective bounds on\(g_X-M_{Z^\prime }\)plane from scattering, beam-dump and\(g-2\)experiments. [PICS code].
Aerosols in Jupiter’s stratosphere form intriguing polar hoods, which have been investigated by ultraviolet cameras on Cassini and the Hubble Space Telescope. Transient, concentrated dark ovals of unknown origin have been noted within both the northern and southern polar hoods. However, a systematic comparative study of their properties, which could elucidate the physical processes active at the poles, has not yet been performed due to infrequent observations. Using 26 global maps of Jupiter taken by Hubble between 1994 and 2022, we detected transient ultraviolet-dark ovals with a 48% to 53% frequency of occurrence in the south. We found the southern dark oval to be 4 to 6 times more common than its northern counterpart. The southern feature is an anticyclonic vortex and remains within the auroral oval during most of its lifetime. The oval’s darkness is consistent with a 20 to 50 times increase in haze abundance or an overall upward shift in the stratospheric haze distribution. The anticyclonic vorticity of the dark oval is enhanced relative to its surroundings, which represents a deep extension of the higher-altitude vortices previously reported in the thermosphere and upper stratosphere. The haze enhancement is probably driven by magnetospheric momentum exchange, with enhanced aerosols producing the localized heating detected in previous infrared retrievals.
We investigate the Chern–Simons-like formulation of exotic general massive gravity models within the framework of third-way to three-dimensional gravity. We classify our construction into two main approaches: one using torsional cosmological Einstein and exotic massive gravity equations, and the other a torsion-free approach. The former approach, while mathematically appealing, precludes the construction of critical exotic models where the central charges vanish. In contrast, the latter approach has a wider parameter space and allows for the construction of critical models. An explicit example of an exotic general model is provided to illustrate both methods. Our methodology represents the first step towards establishing the most general Chern–Simons-like formulation of third-way to three-dimensional gravity, which would enable the study of identifying its bulk/boundary unitary sector.
The precise origins of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain unknown. Multiwavelength observations of nearby FRB sources can provide important insights into the enigmatic FRB phenomenon. Here we present results from a sensitive, broadband X-ray and radio observational campaign of FRB 20200120E, the closest known extragalactic repeating FRB source (located 3.63 Mpc away in an ~10-Gyr-old globular cluster). We place deep limits on the persistent and prompt X-ray emission from FRB 20200120E, which we use to constrain possible origins for the source. We compare our results with various classes of X-ray sources, transients and FRB models. We find that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be associated with ultraluminous X-ray bursts, magnetar-like giant flares or an SGR 1935+2154-like intermediate flare. Although other types of bright magnetar-like intermediate flares and short X-ray bursts would have been detectable from FRB 20200120E during our observations, we cannot entirely rule them out as a class. We show that FRB 20200120E is unlikely to be powered by an ultraluminous X-ray source or a young extragalactic pulsar embedded in a Crab-like nebula. We also provide new constraints on the compatibility of FRB 20200120E with accretion-based FRB models involving X-ray binaries. These results highlight the power of multiwavelength observations of nearby FRBs for discriminating between FRB models.
We study the implications of the observed excess in\(B^+ \rightarrow K^+ \nu \bar{\nu }\)under the assumption of Rank-One Flavour Violation, i.e. that New Physics couples to a single specific direction in flavour space. By varying this direction we perform analyses at the level of the low-energy EFT, the SMEFT, and with explicit mediators such as leptoquarks and colorless vectors (\(Z^\prime \)and\(V^\prime \)). We study correlations with other flavour, electroweak and collider observables, finding that the most interesting ones are with\(K \rightarrow \pi \nu \bar{\nu }\),\(B_s \rightarrow \mu ^+ \mu ^-\), meson mixing and the LHC searches in\(\tau ^+ \tau ^-\)high-energy tails. Among the various mediators, the scalar leptoquarks\(\tilde{R}_2\)and\(S_1\)offer the best fits of the Belle-II excess, while being consistent with the other bounds. On the other hand, colorless vectors are strongly constrained by meson mixing and resonance searches in\(p p \rightarrow \tau ^+ \tau ^-\). In all cases we find that a flavour alignment close to the third generation is generically preferred.
In an extension of MSSM with two triplets and a singlet, called the TNMSSM, there are seven neutralinos which can enrich the study of cold dark matter if one expects that the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is responsible for the observation of Planck satellite. Such a model, compared to the MSSM, can naturally offer a solution to the\(\mu \)problem, and its lightest neutralino, which is bino-like, can also provide a correct relic density by using the coannihilation mechanism due to the newly added triplinos. Taking into account the related experimental measurements, such as the bound on the SM-like Higgs mass, theBmeson rare decays, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon\(a_\mu \), the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measurements and the latest dark matter direct detection experiment LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), the TNMSSM parameter space can be strictly limited. In respect to all the constraints mentioned above, we find that a bino-like neutralino with a mass in the region\([100, 450]~\textrm{GeV}\)can successfully account for the correct dark matter relic density. Additionally, most of the viable parameter space can be tested in the near future experiments such as the Xenon-nT experiment or LHC.
In this paper, we continue previous work where one-brane spacetimes coupled to the\({\mathcal {N}}=2\)ungauged five dimensional hypermultiplets were found. We explore their symmetries as well as study their full geodesic structure. The one-branes are characterized by a coupling constant that distinguishes the behavior of the geodesics from smooth and causally connected in the positive case to singular and repulsive in the negative case.
We investigate Color Flavor Locked (CFL) Strange Stars using the most basic de Rham–Gabadadze–Tolley massive gravity model, which explains the massive graviton in the absence of a ghost propagating mode. In the current study, the compact star model has been achieved by solving the field equations for a static, uncharged sphere (Li et al., in Phys Dark Universe 42: 101308, 2023). Here, we provide some analytical and numerical findings and examine the effects of the massive gravity and anisotropy characteristics on the structure of this stellar object. The modified Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation is obtained by taking into account the hydrostatic equilibrium. In order to verify stability of the stellar object, we have taken into account the redshift function and adibatic index. Furthermore, it is observed that the model parameters have a substantial impact on the mass, radius, and compactness of the star object. Finally, our findings provide a possible structure of hypothetical super massive CFL strange stars, which may be placed in the lower “mass-gap” region\(2~M_{\odot }-5~M_{\odot }\)and remains stable without collapsing into a black hole corresponding to our considered model parameters.
The most recent searches by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in final states with soft leptons and missing transverse energy show mild excesses predominantly associated with dilepton invariant masses of about\(10{-}20\)GeV, which can result from decays of electroweakinos that are heavier than the lightest neutralino by\(\mathcal {O}(10)\)GeV. On the other hand, these analyses are insensitive to electroweakino mass splittings smaller than about 5 GeV. In previous work, we demonstrated that while recent searches in the monojet channel can exclude some of the smallest\(\mathcal {O}(1)\)GeV mass splitting configurations for electroweakinos, they also exhibit excesses that can overlap with the soft-lepton excesses in certain models, including a simplified scenario with pure higgsinos. In this work we dive deeper into these excesses, studying the analyses in detail and exploring an array of models that go beyond the simplified scenarios considered by the experimental collaborations. We show that, in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, the overlapping excesses are not unique to the pure-higgsino limit, instead persisting in realistic parameter space featuring a bino-like lightest supersymmetric particle with some wino admixture. On the other hand, for the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with a singlino-like lightest supersymmetric particle and higgsino-like next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle(s), the excess in the two-lepton channel fits rather well with the parameter space predicting the correct relic abundance through freeze out, but the monojet fit is much poorer. Interestingly, the excesses either do not overlap or do not exist at all for two non-supersymmetric models seemingly capable of producing the correct final states.
We perform a theoretical study on the spectrum of the low-lying hidden-bottom (\(q\bar{q}b\bar{b}\)with\(q=\)u,dands) and double-bottom (\(q\bar{q}bb\)) tetraquark states within a nonrelativistic quark model, in which the instanton-induced interaction is taken as the residual spin-dependent hyperfine interaction between quarks. All the model parameters are fixed by fitting the spectrum of the ground hadron states. The numerical results indicate that masses of several\(X_{q\bar{q}}\),\(Z_{b}\), and\(Z_{bs}\)tetraquark states are below and near thresholds of corresponding meson-meson channels, thus these states may form components of exotic meson states with reasonable probabilities. Especially, in present model, masses of several obtained states with quantum number\(I^G(J^P)=1^+(1^{+})\)are close to\(Z_b^\pm (10610)\), so one may expect these states to be non-negligible components of the experimentally observed\(Z_{b}\)states. Concerning to the double-bottom tetraquark states, the present results are in general consistent with other previous works. Two possible stable\(T_{bb}\)states with quark content\(bb\bar{n}\bar{n}\)(\(n=u\)ordquark) lying at energies 10558 MeV and 10650 MeV are found, and one possible stable\(bb\bar{n}\bar{s}\)state is found, whose energy is\(\sim 10687\)MeV.
In this work, we explore a Schwarzschild-like black hole within the framework of metric-affine bumblebee gravity. First, we investigate the behavior of the Kretschmann scalar and singularities in this modified gravity approach. Next, we introduce a newly defined time coordinate related to a stationary asymptotically flat spacetime. We also analyze the scattering effects and numerically calculate and comprehensively examine the partial and total absorption cross sections. At the high-frequency approximation, we find that the absorption cross section tends to the geodesic capture cross section. The continued fraction method is applied to investigate the quasinormal modes, and we explore the deviations of both the real and imaginary terms of the quasinormal modes from the Schwarzschild case in detail. We verify the relation between the shadow radius and the real part of the quasinormal frequencies at the eikonal limit within this modified gravity framework. Finally, we examine the energy emission rate.
We study the QCD topology and axion properties at finite temperature and chemical potential in the framework of the two-flavor Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model. We find that the behaviors of the two lowest cumulants of the QCD topological charge distribution and axion properties are highly sensitive to the critical behavior of the chiral phase transition. In particular, the topological susceptibility and the axion mass follow the response of the chiral condensate to temperature and chemical potential, showing that both quantities decrease monotonically with the increment of temperature and/or chemical potential. However, it is important to note that the normalized fourth cumulant behaves differently depending on the temperature. At low temperatures, it is a non-monotonic function of the chemical potential, while at high temperatures, it monotonically decreases. Additionally, its value invariably approaches the asymptotic value of\(b_2^{\text {inst}}=-1/12\), predicted by the dilute instanton gas model. We also observe that with the increase in chemical potential at relatively low temperatures, the axion self-coupling constant exhibits a sharp peak around the critical point, which can even be more than twice its vacuum value. After that, the self-coupling drops sharply to a much lower value than its vacuum value, eventually approaching zero in the high chemical potential limit. The finding that the axion self-coupling constant is significantly enhanced in high-density environments near the chiral phase transition could lead to the creation or enhancement of an axion Bose–Einstein condensate in compact astrophysical objects.
We study solutions of Einstein equations with negative cosmological constant in five dimensions that describe black holes whose event horizons are homogeneous, anisotropic spaces. We focus on the case where the constant-time slices of the horizon are the Nil geometry, the Thurston geometry associated to the Heisenberg group. For such spaces, we analyze the symmetries both in the asymptotic region and in the near horizon region. We compute the associated conserved charges, which turn out to be finite and admit a sensible physical interpretation. We analyze the thermodynamics of the Nil black hole, and we present a stationary spinning generalization of it in the slowly rotating approximation.
Vigneron  recently proposed a modification of general relativity in which a non-dynamical term related to the spatial topology is introduced in the Einstein equation. The original motivation for this theory is to allow for the non-relativistic limit to exist in any physical topology. In the present paper, we derive a first inhomogeneous exact vacuum solution of this theory for a spherical topology, assuming staticity and spherical symmetry. The metric represents a black hole and a repulsive singularity at opposite poles of a 3-sphere. The solution is similar to the Schwarzschild metric, but the spacelike infinity is cut, and replaced by a repulsive singularity at finite distance, implying that the spacelike hypersurfaces have finite volume, and the total mass is zero. We discuss how this solution paves the way to massive, non-static solutions of this theory, more directly relevant for cosmology.
The ionization energy loss distributions (spectra) of high-energy protons in oriented silicon crystals are considered on the basis of computer simulation. Evolution of the spectra with the change of the angle\(\theta \)between the particle momentum and the crystal (110) plane is investigated. It is shown that both the most probable and the average energy loss change non-monotonically with the increase of\(\theta \). While at small\(\theta \)these losses are lower than their values in a disoriented crystal, at larger\(\theta \)they can be higher than these values. The dependence of the most probable energy loss on\(\theta \)contains a discontinuity, which however might be challenging to register experimentally. Additionally, the influence of dechanneling and the incident beam divergence on the spectra of planar channeled protons is demonstrated.
The localSL(2N,C) symmetry is shown to provide, when appropriately constrained, a viable framework for a consistent unification of the known elementary forces, including gravity. Such a covariant constraint implies that an actual gauge field multiplet in theSL(2N,C) theory is ultimately determined by the associated tetrad fields which not only specify the geometric features of spacetime but also govern which local internal symmetries are permissible within it. As a consequence, upon the covariant removal of all “redundant” gauge field components, the entire theory only exhibits the effective\(SL(2,C)\times SU(N)\)symmetry, comprisingSL(2,C) gauge gravity on one hand andSU(N) grand unified theory on the other. Given that all states involved in theSL(2N,C) theories are additionally classified according to their spin values, many potentialSU(N) GUTs, including the conventionalSU(5) theory, appear to be irrelevant for standard spin 1/2 quarks and leptons. Meanwhile, applying theSL(2N,C) symmetry to the model of composite quarks and leptons with constituent chiral preons in its fundamental representations reveals, under certain natural conditions, that among all accompanying\(SU(N)_{L}\times SU(N)_{R}\)chiral symmetries of preons and their composites only the\(SU(8)_{L}\times SU(8)_{R}\)meets the anomaly matching condition ensuring masslessness of these composites at large distances. This, in turn, identifiesSL(16,C) with the effective\(SL(2,C)\times SU(8)\)symmetry, accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most likely candidate for hyperunification of the existing elementary forces.
We study zero and finite temperature static Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stars in the combined Rastall-Rainbow (RR) theory of gravity by considering different BEC equation of states (EoSs). We obtain the global properties of BEC stars by solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations of RR gravity with values of Rastall parameter\(\kappa \)and Rainbow function\(\Sigma \)chosen accordingly. We observe that the parameter\(\kappa \)has negligible effect on the maximum mass of the stars considered, whereas\(\Sigma \)alters it significantly, and increasing the value of\(\kappa \)beyond a certain limit results in unstable solutions for any value of\(\Sigma \). We report that the inclusion of temperature in our analysis expands the parameter space by including more values of\(\kappa \). However, temperature has negligible effect on the maximum mass of the stellar profiles in all the three theories. We have also studied the compactness and stability of the obtained stellar equilibria. We report that BEC stars satisfy various energy conditions within the range of\(\kappa \)and\(\Sigma \)taken in our paper.  Further, we find that the maximum masses and radii of the stars within RR theory can have good agreement with the observational data on pulsars for all the EoSs considered and in particular, the Colpi-Wasserman-Shapiro EoS, which was ruled out in General Relativity (GR).  We also find that, in contrast to the results of GR, BEC stars consistent with observations can be realised in the RR theory with smaller bosonic self-interaction strength.
In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal Kähler potential. Following previous studies that revealed that this model can overcome the\(\eta \)-problem found in F-term models, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties, the energy scales of both inflation and string formation influence the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by these cosmic strings.
We construct a new stellar compact object model in the regime of anisotropic pressure using the framework of gravitational decoupling via minimal geometric deformation, with the particularity that the seed solution used is the known Kohler–Chao–Tikekar cosmological solution. As an extra condition to close the Einstein’s field equations resulting for this construction, we use a generalised complexity factor for self-gravitating spheres to the well-known Wyman IIa solution. The resulting model fulfils the fundamental physical acceptability stellar conditions for a compactness factor of a pulsar SMC X-1. The stability of the model is also investigated.
Anisotropic hydrodynamics (aHydro) has proven successful in modeling the evolution of quark-gluon matter created in heavy-ion collisions. The hydrodynamic description of quark-gluon plasma has also been widely used to study sound phenomena, such as shock waves. It has recently been shown that initial fluctuations in energy density and supersonic partons can generate fairly strong shock waves. However, significant anisotropic properties of the system due to the rapid longitudinal expansion of matter have not been taken into account in such studies. Moreover, the process of isotropization and its characteristic time-scales were not considered along with the question of the shock waves formation. Previous studies on shock discontinuous solutions in anisotropic hydrodynamics assumed constant anisotropy, leading to flow refraction towards the anisotropy axis and flow acceleration, characteristics of rarefaction waves, indicating limitations in this approach. This paper investigates discontinuous solutions for normal shock waves without flow refraction, introducing two compression parameters for longitudinal and transverse pressures. The resulting analytical solutions, as well as numerical computations, provide an isotropization mechanism of the system.
In this research paper, we focus on analyzing the electromagnetic fields within the framework of a traversable wormhole that incorporates a cosmic string. We then extend our investigation to a traversable wormhole with a global monopole charge, addressing the same problem in this new context. To facilitate our study, we compute the electromagnetic field tensor and derive Maxwell’s vacuum field equations, which govern the behavior of the electric and magnetic fields. Using an analytical approach, we obtain solutions for the electromagnetic fields and compare them with the results from conventional Minkowski flat space. Our study demonstrates significant deviations in the electromagnetic fields, and thus, changes the behavior of electromagnetic waves in the presence of a cosmic string and a global monopole charges within this wormhole background.
We present a novel simulation of a strongly interacting dark sector also known as the Hidden Valley scenarios using angular ordered showers and the cluster hadronisation model in Herwig 7. We discuss the basics of this implementation and the scale hierarchies underpinning the simulation. With the help of a few benchmarks, we show the effect of variation of dark sector parameters on thrust and angularities within the dark sector, and study correlation functions, which can be helpful for understanding the angular structure of these events. Finally we comment on the uncertainties introduced due to lack of knowledge of hadronisation parameters within the dark sectors.
Teleparallel description of gravity theories where the gravity is mediated through the tetrad field and consequent torsion provide an alternative route to explain the late time cosmic speed up issue. Generalisation  of the teleparallel gravity theory with different functional forms of the torsion scalarTleads tof(T) gravity. The role of scalar field played in addressing issues in cosmology and astrophysics has developed an interest in the inclusion of a scalar field along with an interaction potential in the action. Such a generalised gravity theory is dubbed as\(f(T,\phi )\)theory. We have explored such a gravity theory to reconstruct the interaction potential of the scalar field required for an extended matter bounce scenario. The cosmological implications of the reconstructed scalar field potential are studied considering two viable and well known functional forms of\(f(T,\phi )\). The energy conditions of these model are discussed to assess the viability of the cosmological models.
We introduce a novel Einstein–Rosen BTZ wormhole metric as a solution to the Einstein field equations with a negative cosmological constant and explore in detail its various phenomenological aspects. We show that the wormhole metric is characterized by a horizon at the throat, resembling a black hole horizon. This implies that our wormhole metric describes a one-way traversable wormhole at the throat, with Hawking radiation observed by an observer located at some distance from the wormhole. It is also found the same Hawking temperature using the BTZ-like coordinates and Kruskal-like coordinates. This temperature is invariant not only on the type of coordinates but also the nature of the spin of quantum fields. Importantly, we find that at the wormhole throat, the spacetime is not a pure vacuum solution, but rather contains an exotic string matter source with negative tension, which may stabilize the wormhole geometry. To this end, we found that the size of the wormhole throat is proportional to the number of quantum bits suggesting a possible implications on ER=EPR. Further we studied the particle dynamics and, finally, we tested the ANEC with a test scalar and vector fields. For the double null-component computed in BTZ coordinates, we found an apparent divergence at the wormhole throat, which is then shown to be regularized by means of Kruskal-like coordinates. The ANEC for such a scalar/vector field is violated at the wormhole throat.
The aim of this paper is to explore the thermodynamic topology of topological charged dilatonic black holes. To achieve this, our study will begin by examining the characteristics of topological charged black holes in dilaton gravity. Specifically, we will concentrate on the impact of the topological constant on the event horizon of these black holes. Subsequently, we will analyze these black holes, considering their thermodynamic and conserved quantities, in order to assess the validity of the first law of thermodynamics. We explore the thermodynamic topology of these black holes by treating them as thermodynamic defects. For our study, we examine two types of thermodynamic ensembles: the fixedqensemble and the fixed\(\phi \)ensemble. To study the impact of the topological constant (k) on thermodynamic topology, we consider all possible types of curvature hypersurfaces that can form in these black holes. By calculating the topological charges at the defects within their thermodynamic spaces, we analyze both the local and global topology of these black holes. We also investigate how the parameters of dilaton gravity affect the thermodynamic topology of black holes and highlight the differences compared to charged black holes in the General Relativity.
A shear-free, collapsing compact object, described by an embedding class I solution and emitting radiation, is presented here. Because of the properties of embedding class I, this four-dimensional interior spacetime can be embedded in pseudo-flat five-dimensional space. Starting with an initially static and shear-free gravitating body through the Karmarkar condition, we have explored the time evolution of the system using the time-dependent Einstein field equations. The interior solution is smoothly matched with the Vaidya outgoing solution across a time-like hypersurface which yields the temporal behaviour of the model. Further, a thorough physical analysis of the thermodynamic variables has been presented spatially and temporally. As the time progresses into the future, the surface compactness factor approaches the Buchdahl limit until it crosses this to proceed with the collapse. Before\(2m_\Sigma /r_\Sigma \rightarrow 8/9\), the equation of state adjusts itself like a self-immune system to hold the system by increasing\(\Gamma _{rc}\)(i.e. increasing stiffness). All the physical quantities, e.g., density, pressure anisotropy, radiation, luminosity, temperature, are non-singular throughout the interior of the star at a finite time slice. As the time progresses, these quantities point towards a future singularity. Throughout the evolution, the surface density and surface pressure always remain lower than their corresponding central values. Similarly, the causal temperature also always remains higher than the non-causal counterpart throughout the interior as well as during the evolution.
AbstractThe paper summarizes the main provisions of Alexander Spirin’s concept on the possible role of RNA, molecular machines, and molecular colonies in the emergence of life, including (1) the role of the capability of polyribonucleotides of spontaneous rearrangements and recombinations in the generation of RNA molecules and development of their structure, as well as in the early replication of RNA; (2) the principle of operation of molecular machines powered by the energy of Brownian motion and the need for their emergence to solve the problem of unwinding double-stranded molecules formed as a result of the complementary copying of RNA; (3) the role of molecular colonies formed during the replication of RNA in porous media as a mode of compartmentalization and as a prerequisite for the evolution in the precellular RNA world.
Abstract—The paper examines two habitable zones with different physical conditions on exoplanets: planets with liquid water on the surface and conditions close to Earth’s (“Goldilocks Zone”), and cold worlds with icy surfaces and subsurface oceans (“Snow Maiden Zone”). The mechanisms of exchange of matter and energy between subglacial oceans and the surrounding space are discussed. It is noted that the biospheres of icy worlds with internal oceans are better protected from unfavorable external cosmic conditions. Subglacial biospheres are weakly dependent on the radiation intensity and flare activity of their parent stars, and the number of planets in the Universe with the physical conditions of the icy Snow Maiden Zone significantly exceeds the number of planets in the very limited Goldilocks Zone. It can be assumed that it is the biospheres of icy oceanic worlds that are much more widespread in the Universe compared to terrestrial-type biospheres.
Abstract—According to data obtained by theUlyssesspacecraft in 2017, high-latitude current sheets have been discovered in the polar heliosphere. They have been observed during solar activity minima in 1994 and 2007 at a distance of 2–3 AU above the south pole of the Sun. The discovered current sheets formed a conical surface rotating as a whole around the Sun’s rotation axis with the Carrington period. In this study, a semianalytical MHD model of conical current sheets is developed. The internal structure of heliospheric region bounded by these sheets—a magnetic funnel with reduced solar wind speed and the plasma beta—has been studied. Solutions corresponding to different intersections of the funnel by theUlyssesspacecraft have been obtained under different conditions near the Sun. The conditions under which the dimensions of the funnel agree with observations are clarified. For the first time, situations are treated in which the plasma and magnetic field parameters inside the funnel vary quasi-periodically in space. The study of the magnetic funnel structure challenges new issues for solar physics, whose solutions will enable a better understanding of the physical conditions on the early Earth and the features of the primary biosphere formation.
Abstract—Analysis of meteorites and terrestrial rocks using modern bacterial paleontology methods leads to the conclusion that Life did not originate on Earth, but originated in the form of a protogenome during the formation of the Solar System. Micron and submicron organisms have existed since the origin of the Solar System to the Phanerozoic and into the Phanerozoic on Earth. The study of this organic world can seriously change the understanding of the general development of the living world and the patterns of its evolution, as well as our understanding of the volume of minerals associated with the Precambrian.
AbstractComputer modeling has shown that, during the collisional evolution of a solid-state component in gas–dust protoplanetary disks, porous dust clusters of widely ranging sizes are formed. Clusters of this kind have a well-developed internal structure that is topologically similar to the structure of porous catalysts, adsorbents, and carriers used in the organic synthesis technology. On the other hand, observational data currently obtained by such instruments as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) show that complex preorganic compounds rather than only water and volatiles are present in protoplanetary disks. This suggests the possibility that, in protoplanetary disks, there are mechanisms of capturing complex chemical compounds by porous dust clusters and transporting these compounds to warmer regions during migration. When getting to warmer regions of protoplanetary disks, dust clusters undergo a change in the pore space, which may increase the surface holding the captured compounds and, hence, intensify their reactivity.
We consider gedanken experiments to destroy Kerr black holes, by means of absorbing matter with sufficient energy and angular momentum. It is shown that extremal and near-extremal Kerr black holes cannot be destroyed in a process that includes a second order contribution to its final mass, and matter sources satisfy the null energy condition. Such contribution is calculated using hypersurface integration on the event horizon, and it traces similarities with terms related to matter-black hole interactions and a rotational self-energy lower bound suggested in previous works.
AbstractThe study of microorganism tolerance to extreme influences is an integral part of astrobiology. Despite the large number of works in this field, the limits of maintaining viability and activity remain uncertain, and they are probably much wider than the currently known boundaries, especially taking into account the adaptive capabilities of microorganisms. In the vast majority of astrobiological experiments, a very limited set of organisms and the impact of a small number of factors are studied. It seems natural that research gradually develops from modeling simple systems (pure cultures and single-factor impacts) to more complex ones, closer to hypothetical extraterrestrial ecosystems. Nevertheless, studies of the most complex systems (microbial communities under the complex action of extraterrestrial conditions in laboratory and space experiments) are still extremely few in number. At the same time, some features of multifactor impacts and the response of complex microbial systems to such impacts are often given little attention. This paper attempts to summarize some data on the tolerance of microorganisms to extreme factors of extraterrestrial space, as well as to outline a number of insufficiently studied promising fields of astrobiological research.
Abstract—The Drake formula or equation represents the best known way of introducing the question of the distribution of life and intelligence in the Universe into the framework of quantitative science. A generalization of the Drake equation is presented in the form of a partial differential equation that includes the effects of the transfer of life elements from one exoplanetary system to another. Possible implications of this equation for assessing the prospects for detecting life beyond Earth are discussed.
This research delves into the potential existence of traversable wormholes (WHs) within the framework of modified, curvature based gravity. The modification includes linear perturbations of the matter Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor with specific coupling strengths\(\alpha \)and\(\beta \)and can thus be viewed as a special case of linearf(R,T)-gravity with a variable matter coupling or as the simplest additively separable\(f(R,{\mathcal {L}}_m,T)\)-model. A thorough examination of static WH solutions is undertaken using a constant redshift function; therefore, our work can be regarded as the first-order approximation of WH theories in\(f(R,{\mathcal {L}}_m,T)\). The analysis involves deriving WH shape functions based on non-commutative geometry, with a particular focus on Gaussian and Lorentzian matter distributions\(\rho \). Constraints on the coupling parameters are developed so that the shape function satisfies both the flaring-out and asymptotic flatness conditions. Moreover, for positive coupling parameters, violating the null energy condition (NEC) at the WH throat\(r_0\)demands the presence of exotic matter. For negative couplings, however, we find that exotic matter can be avoided by establishing the upper bound\(\beta +\alpha /2<-\frac{1}{\rho r_0^2}-8\pi \). Additionally, the effects of gravitational lensing are explored, revealing the repulsive force of our modified gravity for large negative couplings. Lastly, the stability of the derived WH solutions is verified using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) formalism.
We formulate a new class of modified gravity models, that is, generalized four-dimensional Chern–Pontryagin models, whose action is characterized by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalarRand the Chern–Pontryagin topological term\( ^*RR\), i.e.,\(f(R, ^*RR)\). Within this framework, we derive the gravitational field equations and solve them for the particular models,\(f(R, ^*RR)=R+\beta ( ^*RR)^2\)and\(f(R, ^*RR)=R+\alpha R^2+\beta ( ^*RR)^2\), considering two ansatzes: the slowly rotating Schwarzschild metric and first-order perturbations of Gödel-type metrics. For the former, we find a first-order correction to the frame-dragging effect boosted by the parameterL, which characterizes the departures from general relativity results. For the latter, Gödel-type metrics hold unperturbed, for specific sort of perturbed metric functions. We conclude this paper by displaying that generalized four-dimensional Chern–Pontryagin models admit a scalar-tensor representation, whose explicit form presents two scalar fields:\(\Phi \), a dynamical degree of freedom, while the second,\(\vartheta \), a non-dynamical degree of freedom. In particular, the scalar field\(\vartheta \)emerges coupled with the Chern–Pontryagin topological term\( ^*RR\), i.e.,\(\vartheta ^*RR\), which is nothing more than Chern–Simons term.
AbstractThis paper gives a review of the latest observational data on early stellar nucleosynthesis in the Universe compiled on the basis of an invited report at the “Astronomical Problems of the Origin and Development of Life. The Young Sun and the Earth” meeting-discussion dedicated to the memory of Academician M.Ya. Marov, March 19, 2024. The article presents modern observational results and theoretical ideas about the origin of chemical elements such as carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, which are important for the synthesis of organic matter.
Abstract—The concept of the origin of life outside the Earth is currently one of the dominant directions of theoretical, experimental and observational scientific research. The problem of the origin of life is interdisciplinary and includes the most pressing issues of astronomy, biology, paleontology, organic chemistry and other sciences. This issue of the journal is devoted to the astronomical aspects of the origin and development of life.
Abstract—The Russian space project with the automatic lunar station (ALS)Luna-28is designed to deliver samples of lunar polar regolith to Earth. It is known that the regolith in the vicinity of the lunar poles may contain several percent by weight of water ice and other volatile compounds of cosmic origin. A significant portion of the lunar water could have been delivered to the Moon by comets. It is known that cometary water contains organic compounds, some of which have a complex prebiological structure. Similar comets collided with the Earth in the distant past and also delivered organic compounds of cosmic origin to our planet. According to the panspermia hypothesis, such compounds in the Earth’s primordial ocean could have initiated the process of the emergence of initial forms of primitive life. On the Moon, similar cometary organic matter may be preserved in pristine form in polar permafrost. Studying samples of the polar material delivered in theLuna-28ALS return capsule in terrestrial laboratories will allow experimental verification of the presence or absence of extraterrestrial life spores in it.
AbstractThe optical properties of the atmosphere limit the capabilities of ground-based astronomy. Taking telescopes beyond the atmosphere has allowed not only to significantly expand the spectral range of observations, but also to achieve great success in measurements in the visible range. In part, this has stimulated the creation of adaptive optical systems for ground-based telescopes. Of particular interest in the study of planets and exoplanets are observations in the IR and submm ranges. The capabilities of ground-based observations in these ranges are expanding, but will always remain limited. Extra-atmospheric astronomy has absolute priority in this. The article provides an overview of extra-atmospheric observatories in the UV, visible and IR ranges. Particular attention is paid to the new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
Abstract—A review of the results on the migration of celestial bodies in the Solar System and in some exoplanetary systems is presented. Some problems of planet accumulation and migration of planetesimals, small bodies and dust in the forming and present Solar System are considered. It has been noted that the outer layers of the Earth and Venus could have accumulated similar planetesimals from different areas of the feeding zone of the terrestrial planets. In addition to the theory of coaccretion and the mega-impact and multi-impact models, the formation of the embryos of the Earth and the Moon from a common rarefied condensation with subsequent growth of the main mass of the embryo of the Moon near the Earth is also discussed. Along with the Nice model and the “grand tack” model, a model is considered in which the embryos of Uranus and Neptune increased the semimajor axes of their orbits from values of no more than 10 AU to present values only due to gravitational interactions with planetesimals (without the motions of Jupiter and Saturn entering into resonance). The influence of changes in the semimajor axis of Jupiter’s orbit on the formation of the asteroid belt is discussed, as well as the influence of planetesimals from the feeding zone of the giant planets on the formation of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. The migration of bodies to the terrestrial planets from different distances from the Sun is considered. It is noted that bodies from the feeding zone of the giant planets and from the outer asteroid belt could deliver to the Earth a quantity of water comparable to the mass of water in the Earth’s oceans. The migration of bodies ejected from the Earth is considered. It is noted that about 20% of the ejected bodies that left the Earth’s sphere of influence eventually fell back to the Earth. The probabilities of collisions of dust particles with the Earth are usually an order of magnitude greater than the probabilities of collisions of their parent bodies with the Earth. The migration of planetesimals is considered in exoplanetary systems Proxima Centauri and TRAPPIST-1. The amount of water delivered to the inner planet Proxima Centauri b, may have been more than the amount delivered to the Earth. The outer layers of neighboring planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system may contain similar material if there were many planetesimals near their orbits during the late stages of planetary accumulation.
Abstract—The article is devoted to the significantly underestimated contribution of radiation from the young Sun to the formation of physical conditions on the early Earth. A new view on the faint young Sun paradox is presented: the main role in solving the paradox is given to the impact of the increased activity of the young Sun on the Earth’s atmosphere. The role of planetary organic films is considered as a climate-forming factor involved in resolving the faint young Sun paradox. The spectrum of radiation of the young Sun and the paradox of the discrepancy between the chlorophyll absorption spectrum and the spectrum of solar radiation are discussed, and also indicated a possible connection between the faint young Sun paradox and the origin and evolution of photosynthesis on Earth.
In current studies for testing Bell inequalities at colliders, the reconstruction of spin correlations from scattering cross-sections relies on the bilinear form of the spin correlations, but not all local hidden variable models (LHVMs) have such a property. To demonstrate that a general LHVM cannot be rule out via scattering cross-section data, we propose a specific LHVM, which can exactly duplicate the same scattering cross-section for particle production and decay as the standard quantum theory, making it indistinguishable at colliders in principle. Despite of this, we find that reconstructing spin correlations through scattering cross-sections can still exclude a broad class of LHVMs, e.g., those models employing classical spin correlations as a surrogate for quantum spin correlations.
In this paper, we use the solution phase space approach based on the covariant phase space formalism to compute the conserved charges of the BTZ black hole, namely mass, angular momentum, and entropy. Furthermore, we discuss the first law of the BTZ black hole and the Smarr relation. For completeness, outer horizon and inner horizon cases have been all included. Additionally, the results of the three-dimensional Kerr-dS spacetime have also been obtained. Our results are consistent with previous investigations. Considering the simplicity of the circumstances, we have presented the most detailed possible information, with the aim of facilitating rsearch in related fields.
The branching ratios of the flavor changing top quark decays in the SM are too small to be detected experimentally. Therefore, any observable signal for these processes at the LHC would serve as compelling evidence for new physics. In the flavor-dependent\(U(1)_X\)model, a newly introduced Higgs singlet interacts directly with the quark sector and mixes with the SM-like Higgs, influencing the\(t\rightarrow ch\)and\(t\rightarrow uh\)process. Additionally, the flavor dependence of the\(U(1)_X\)charge affect the\(t\rightarrow cZ\)process. In this work, we investigate these process within the framework of the flavor-dependent\(U(1)_X\)model. Numerical results indicates that with suitable choices of new physics parameters, the branching ratios of these processes in the flavor-dependent\(U(1)_X\)model can be significantly enhanced. Specifically, the branching ratios of\(t\rightarrow ch\)and\(t\rightarrow uh\)can reach the order of\(10^{-4}\)in some chosen parameter spaces, which is close to the current experimental upper limit. This suggests that these processes have significant opportunities to be observed experimentally, and the parameter space of the model will face constraints from the experimental upper bounds.
We study the hot medium effects in high-multiplicity proton–proton (pp) collisions at\(\sqrt{s_{NN}}=13\)TeV via the charmonium probes. The hot medium is described with the hydrodynamic model, while charmonium evolutions in the medium are studied with a time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The hot medium dissociation on charmonium is considered with the temperature-dependent complex potential parametrized with the results from lattice QCD calculations. The ratio\(\sigma _{\psi (2S)}/\sigma _{J/\psi }\)of\(J/\psi \)and\(\psi (2S)\)production cross sections are calculated and compared with the LHCb experimental data in pp collisions. Our calculations explain the charmonium relative suppression in different transverse momentum and multiplicity bins. The suppression of this ratio is mainly affected by the effects of the deconfined medium. It is less affected by the initial effects before the generation of the heavy quark pair. We suggest this to be a clear signal of the small QGP droplets generated in high multiplicity pp collisions.
Matching conditions are universal ingredients that describe how fragmentation functions change when heavy-flavour thresholds are crossed during the factorisation scale evolution. They are the last missing piece for a consistent description of observables with identified final-state hadrons at next-to-next-to leading order accuracy in quantum chromodynamics. We present an analytical form of the matching condition for light-flavour to hadron fragmentation function at next-to-next-to leading order. The derivation is performed by extending the formalism employed in the extraction of the next-to leading order matching conditions to the subsequent order, making use of\(e^+e^-\)annihilation cross sections. We obtain the first non-trivial heavy-quark effect in the light-quark fragmentation functions and provide results in Mellin space.
Recently, J. Harada proposed a theory relating gravity to the Cotton tensor, dubbed as “Cotton gravity” (CG). This is an extension of General Relativity such that every solution of the latter turns out to be a solution of the former (but the converse is not true) and, furthermore, it is possible to derive the cosmological constant as an integration constant within it. In this work we investigate CG by coupling it to both non-linear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields. We study static and spherically symmetric solutions implementing a bouncing behaviour in the radial function so as to avoid the development of singularities, inspired by the Simpson–Visser black bounce and the Bardeen model, both interpreted as magnetic monopoles. We identify the NLED Lagrangian density and the scalar field potential generating such solutions, and investigate the corresponding gravitational configurations in terms of horizons, behaviour of the metric functions, and regularity of the Kretchsman curvature scalar. Our analysis extends the class of non-singular geometries found in the literature and paves the ground for further analysis of black holes in CG.
We consider the non-commutative (NC) Kerr black hole where the mass of the central object is smeared over a region of linear size\(\sqrt{b}\),bis the strength of the NC character of spacetime. For the spacetime under consideration, we calculate the amplification factor for electromagnetic and gravitational fields and study various properties of a thin accretion disk. The expression for the amplification factor is obtained with the help of the asymptotic matching technique. The amplification factor is then plotted against frequency for various values of the spinaand the NC parameterb. Though the amplification factor increases withabut decreases withb, the cut-off frequency up to which we have amplification increases withaandb. We then study the effect of the spin and the NC nature of spacetime on the energy flux, temperature distribution, emission spectrum, energy conversion efficiency, and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit of a thin accretion disk around the black hole with the help of the steady-state Novikov–Thorne model. Our study reveals that these quantities increase with the spin and the NC parameter. We also find that the disk around the NC Kerr black is hotter and more luminous than that around the Kerr black hole and the NC Schwarzschild black hole. We can conclusively infer from our investigation that the NC nature of spacetime has a significant impact on the superradiance phenomenon as well as on various properties of thin accretion disks.
The focus of this work is centered on determining whether traversable wormholes admitting Einasto density profile exist within the framework off(R,T) gravity. Using the Morris–Thorne spacetime, we express the wormhole configuration and formulate the anisotropic gravitational equations for a particular linear modified model. Afterwards, by considering two different (constant and variable) redshift functions, we derive the shape function for wormholes and examine its potential stability. The developed functions conform to the necessary conditions and form a connection between two spacetime regions that are asymptotically flat. We also examine the viability of resulting wormhole solutions by verifying their violation with the null energy conditions. We also investigate the active gravitational mass and the complexity factor for our solutions. The later quantity is found to be negative near the wormhole throat and becomes zero when moving away from this point. Further, various methods of stability analysis are utilized to assess the developed models. Our results suggest that the constructed wormhole geometries meet the necessary conditions, thereby existing within the considered modified gravity.
The paper studies the possible interplay between matter and geometry in scalar tensor theories of gravitation where the energy–momentum tensor is directly coupled with the Einstein tensor. After obtaining the scalar tensor representation of the\(f(R, G_{\mu \nu }T^{\mu \nu })\)gravity, the analysis continue with an approach based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes in open systems. To this regard, various thermodynamic properties are directly obtained in this manner, like the matter creation (annihilation) rate and the corresponding creation (annihilation) pressure. In the case of the Roberson–Walker metric several analytic and numerical solutions are found in the asymptotic regime. In the last part of the manuscript a specific parametrization for the Hubble rate is constrained using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms in the case of cosmic chronometers (CC) and BAO observations, obtaining an approximate numerical solution which can describe the cosmological model. For this model, we have obtained by fine-tuning some numerical solutions which exhibit creation mechanisms in different specific regimes.
In this work we study the thermodynamics formulation for unimodular gravity under the election of two different models for the energy diffusion function. Such function encodes the current for the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor and is usually termed asQ(t). In analogy to the cosmological scenario where the cosmic expansion is influenced byQ(t), the thermodynamics implications in this scheme are also determined by the choice of the functionQ(t), as we discuss in the work. Specifically, we consider the barotropic and the continuous spontaneous localization models as energy diffusion functions, commonly used in the literature as viable candidates to face the well-known\(H_{0}\)tension. The consistency conditions demanded for the entropy of the system in terms of the cosmological parameters of the model: positive production (\(dS/dt>0\)) and convexity condition (\(d^{2}S/dt^{2} <0\)), are investigated. We show that these conditions strongly constraint the viability of both models. Additionally, we comment about our results and compare with those obtained in recent works where the restriction of the parameters for these two diffusion models was implemented with the use of cosmological data.
Jupiter’s oxygen content is inextricably tied to its formation history and the evolution of the early Solar System. Recent one-dimensional thermochemical modelling of CO showed that the planet’s bulk water content could be subsolar, in stark contrast to the water enrichment determined near the equator using the Juno spacecraft. Here we use a hydrodynamic model to study Jupiter’s atmospheric dynamics at and below the water cloud level with simplified thermochemistry to show the effect of hydrodynamics on the abundance of disequilibrium species CO, PH3and GeH4in the troposphere. If PH3and GeH4provide only an upper limit for the oxygen abundance (≤5 times solar), our results suggest an oxygen enrichment range of 2.5–5 times solar using updated CO thermochemistry. Using the conventional CO chemical timescale, we further reveal a correlation between moist convection and the CO abundance at the water cloud level. If such a correlation is found observationally, it would favour the formation of Jupiter near the snow line, which harbours a supersolar oxygen abundance.
The Monumentexperiment measures ordinary muon capture (OMC) on isotopes relevant for neutrinoless double-beta (\(0\nu \beta \beta \)) decay and nuclear astrophysics. OMC is a particularly attractive tool for improving the theoretical description of\(0\nu \beta \beta \)decay. It involves similar momentum transfers and allows testing the virtual transitions involved in\(0\nu \beta \beta \)decay against experimental data. During the 2021 campaign, Monumentstudied OMC on\(^{76}\)Se and\(^{136}\)Ba, the isotopes relevant for next-generation\(0\nu \beta \beta \)decay searches, like Legendand nEXO. The experimental setup has been designed to accurately extract the total and partial muon capture rates, which requires precise reconstruction of energies and time-dependent intensities of the OMC-related\(\gamma \)rays. The setup also includes a veto counter system to allow selecting a clean sample of OMC events. This work provides a detailed description of the Monumentsetup operated during the 2021 campaign, its two DAQ systems, calibration and analysis approaches, and summarises the achieved detector performance. Future improvements are also discussed.
We investigate electrical charge transport in hot magnetized plasma using first-principles quantum field theoretical methods. By employing Kubo’s linear response theory, we express the electrical conductivity tensor in terms of the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation. Utilizing leading-order results for the damping rates from a recent study within a gauge theory, we derive the transverse and longitudinal conductivities for a strongly magnetized plasma. The analytical expressions reveal drastically different mechanisms that explain the high anisotropy of charge transport in a magnetized plasma. Specifically, the transverse conductivity is suppressed, while the longitudinal conductivity is enhanced by a strong magnetic field. As in the case of zero magnetic field, longitudinal conduction is determined by the probability of charge carriers to remain in their quantum states without damping. In contrast, transverse conduction critically relies on quantum transitions between Landau levels, effectively lifting charge trapping in localized Landau orbits. We examine the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the transverse and longitudinal electrical conductivities over a wide range of parameters and investigate the effects of a nonzero chemical potential. Additionally, we extend our analysis to strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma and study the impact of the coupling constant on the anisotropy of electrical charge transport.
In this paper, our aim is to extend our earlier work [Ahmed et al. in Eur. Phys. J. C 76:280, 2016], investigating an axisymmetric plasma flow with angular momentum onto a spherical black hole. To accomplish that goal, we focus on the case in which the ideal magnetohydrodynamic approximation is valid, utilizing certain conservation laws which arise from particular symmetries of the system. After formulating a Hamiltonian of the physical system, we solve the Hamilton equations and look for critical solutions of (both in and out) flows. Reflecting the difference from the Schwarzschild spacetime, the positions of sonic points (fast magnetosonic point, slow magnetosonic point, Alfvén point) are altered. We explore several kinds of flows including critical, non-critical, global, magnetically arrested and shock induced. Lastly, we analyze the shock states near a specific quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole and determine that quantum effects do not favor shock states by pushing the shock location outward.
In this paper, we study black hole solutions in double field theory. In the first part, we introduce a solution-generating method and classify black hole solutions into three categories in standard double field theory. To solve the problem of double time, we utilize space/time split double field theory in the second part to derive black hole solutions. By introducing a cosmological constant and imposing the strong constraint, our findings indicate that when considering the entire doubled spacetime, the curvature signifies a generalized AdS vacuum. However, in the subspace of the entire spacetime, black holes and curvature singularities emerge.
According to the quantum deformation approach to quantum gravity, the thermodynamical entropy of a quantum-deformed (q-deformed) black hole with horizon areaAestablished by Jalalzadeh is expressed as\(S = \pi \sin \left( \frac{A}{8G\mathcal {N}} \right) /\sin \left( \frac{\pi }{2\mathcal {N}}\right) \), where\(\mathcal {N}=L_q^2/L_{p}^2\)is the q-deformation parameter,\(L_{p}\)denotes the Planck length, and\(L_q\)denotes the quantum-deformed cosmic apparent horizon distance. In this paper, assuming that the q-deformed entropy is associated with the apparent horizon of the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) universe, we derive the modified Friedmann equation from the unified first law of thermodynamics,\( dE = TdS + WdV \). And this one obtained is in line with the modified Friedmann equation derived from the law of emergence proposed by Padmanabhan. It clearly shows the connection between the law of emergence and thermodynamics. We further investigate the constraints of entropy maximization in the framework of the q-deformed horizon entropy, and the results demonstrate the consistency of the law of emergence with the maximization of the q-deformed horizon entropy.
We report the performance of a magnetically silent optically pumped cesium magnetometer with a statistical sensitivity of 3.5 pT/\(\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}\)at 1 Hz and a stability of 90 fT over 150 s of measurement. Optical pumping with coherent, linearly-polarized, resonant light leads to a relatively long-lived polarized ground state of the cesium vapour contained in a measurement cell. The state precesses at its Larmor frequency in the magnetic field to be measured. Nonlinear magneto-optical rotation then leads to the rotation of the plane of polarization of a linearly polarized probe laser beam. The rotation angle is modulated at twice the Larmor frequency. A measurement of this frequency constitutes an absolute measurement of the magnetic field magnitude. Featuring purely optical operation, non-magnetic construction, low noise floor, and high stability, this sensor will be used for the upcoming TUCAN electric dipole moment experiment and other highly sensitive magnetic applications. Novel aspects of the system include commercial construction and the ability to operate up to 24 sensors on a single probe laser diode.
The null energy condition (NEC) is a fundamental principle in general relativity, and its violation could leave discernible signatures in gravitational waves (GWs). A violation of the NEC during the primordial era would imprint a blue-tilted spectrum on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nanohertz frequencies, potentially accounting for the recently detected signal by pulsar timing arrays. Remarkably, models of NEC violation during inflation also predict a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum in the millihertz frequency range, which could be detectable by upcoming space-based GW detectors such as Taiji. The observation of this distinctive spectrum would provide compelling evidence for new physics beyond the standard cosmological paradigm. In this study, we explore Taiji’s ability to detect an SGWB arising from NEC violation during inflation, considering various foregrounds and noise sources, including an extragalactic foreground from binary black hole mergers throughout the Universe, a galactic foreground from white dwarf binaries, and the intrinsic noise of the Taiji detector. Employing comprehensive Bayesian parameter estimation techniques to analyze simulated Taiji data, we demonstrate a remarkable improvement in precision of three orders of magnitude compared to the NANOGrav 15-year data set for measuring the tensor power spectrum amplitude,\(P_{T,2}\), during the second inflationary stage. This substantial enhancement in measurement capabilities underscores Taiji’s potential as a powerful probe for investigating the NEC violation in the early Universe.
We revisit planar vortex solutions within a model derived from the dimensional reduction of scalar electromagnetism, with a quartic potential incorporating the Carroll–Field–Jackiw term. We explore analytically and numerically the influence of a Lorentz symmetry-breaking constant field on these configurations and our analysis shows how this constant field can produce a new asymptotic behaviour characterised by damped oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields on the edge of the vortices.
In a simplified model including an exotic vector-likeX-quark (VLQ-X) with electric charge 5/3, we investigate the process\(e^{+}p \rightarrow \bar{\nu }_{e}X+\bar{\nu }_{e}X\bar{t}\)induced by the couplings between the VLQ-Xand the first- and third-generation quarks at the futureepcolliders. We further explore the prospects of discovering the VLQ-Xvia the\(X\rightarrow tW\)decay model at the electron–hadron Future Circular Collider (FCC-eh) with its proposed 60 GeV electron beam and 50 TeV proton beam. We focus our analysis on the final states, including two same-sign lepton (electrons or muons) or\(\mu \mu \)pairs, at least oneb-tagged jet, and large missing transverse momentum. By performing a detailed signal-to-background analysis and detector simulations, the 95% confidence level exclusion limits and\(5\sigma \)discovery reaches are presented in terms of parameter space regions.
We investigate the radiative efficiency and jet power in the spacetime of a rotating black hole within the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG), which includes an additional LQG parameter. The results show that as the LQG parameter increases, the radiative efficiency decreases for slowly rotating black holes while it increases for rapidly rotating black holes. Furthermore, the jet power is found to increase for different black hole spins. With the observed data from the well-known sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, GRS1124-683, GRO J1655-40, and GRS1915+105, we make some constraints on the black hole spin parameter and the LQG parameter. The presence of the LQG parameter broadens the allowed range of the black hole spin parameter for sources A0620-00, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564 and GRO J1655-40. However, for the source GRS 1915+105, there is no overlap between the allowed parameter regions, which implies that the rotating LQG black hole cannot simultaneously account for the observed jet power and the radiative efficiency as in other black hole spacetimes
Recent measurements of the Lamb shift of muonic helium-4 ions were used to infer the alpha particle charge radius. The value found is compatible with the radius extracted from the analysis of the electron-helium scattering. Thus, the new spectroscopic data put additional empirical bounds on some free parameters of certain physics theories beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we analyze the new data in the context of large extra-dimensional theories. Specifically, we calculate the influence of the radion, the scalar degree of freedom of the higher-dimensional gravity, on the energy difference between the 2S and 2P levels of this exotic atom. The radion field is related to fluctuations of the volume of the supplementary space. It should be treated as a phenomenologically independent quantity in relation to the tensorial degrees of freedom of the metric within the braneworld scenario. Based on the spectroscopic data of muonic helium, we find constraints for the effective energy scale of the radion as a function of the alpha particle radius. Then, we discuss the implications of these new constraints on the proton radius puzzle. We also establish a new empirical bound for the radion by examining its influence on the isotopic shift in the 2P-2S transition of muonic hydrogen and muonic deuteron. In connection with this discussion, we study the impact of the radion on the tension observed in measurements of the difference between the squared radii of the helion and alpha particle as extracted from muonic and electronic helium isotopes.
A study of the dynamical and thermodynamical stability of a charged thin-shell wormhole built by gluing two Reissner–Nordström geometries is presented. The charge on the shell is linearly related to the matter content. For the dynamical stability, a concise inequality is obtained, valid for any barotropic equation of state that relates the pressure with the energy density at the throat. A thermodynamical description of the system is introduced, which leads to the temperature and the electric potentials. Adopting a linear equation of state for the pressure and a definite form for the entropy function, the set of equilibrium configurations that are both dynamically and thermodynamically stable is found.
Significant enhancements of J/\(\psi \)production have been observed by various experiments at RHIC and LHC for very low transverse momenta in peripheral heavy-ion collisions, which has ignited a surge of investigations into photon-induced processes in hadronic heavy-ion collisions (HHICs). Within this wave of research enthusiasm, the search for more photon induced products in HHICs becomes paramount. In this paper, we perform the calculation of the\(\rho \)and\(\phi \)production resulting from photon-nucleus interactions in HHICs, which are crucial probes for studying the properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in HHICs. Our study reveals that, in comparison to hadronic production, the photon-induced production of\(\rho \)and\(\phi \)does not reach the same level of significance as that observed in J/\(\psi \)production. Nevertheless, it remains substantial, especially in peripheral collisions, holding great promise for experimental verification in the imminent future.
During the cosmic evolution process, as the temperature of a cosmological boson gas falls below a certain threshold, a Bose–Einstein condensation process can occur at various points throughout the cosmic history of the Universe. In this model, dark matter, conceptualized as a non-relativistic, Newtonian gravitational condensate is governed by the Gross–Pitaevskii–Poisson system. In our present study, we investigate the Bose–Einstein condensation process of bosonic DM by treating it as an approximate first-order phase transition within a modified cosmological framework, known as Tsallis cosmology. We examine the evolution of relevant physical quantities characterizing the evolution dynamics of the Universe, including energy density, temperature, redshift, scale factor, Hubble parameter, and dimensionless deceleration parameter before, during, and following the Bose–Einstein condensation phase transition takes place. Additionally, we especially investigate the specific era of the evolution of the Universe characterized by a mixture ofnormaland condensate phases of dark matter. We analyze the behavior of temporal evolution of an important time-dependent parameter, called the condensate dark matter fraction throughout the condensation process and find the time duration of condensation of dark matter in the Tsallis cosmological model. We see that the presence of Bose–Einstein condensate dark matter in the framework of Tsallis-modified cosmology significantly alters the cosmological evolution of the Universe as compared to the standard model of cosmology. We also find for a typical value of Tsallis non-extensive parameter\(\beta =0.35\), the model could explain an accelerated Universe without invoking any additional energy component and solve the age problem of our Universe.
Since the weak cosmic censorship conjecture was proposed, research on this conjecture has been ongoing. This paper explores the conjecture in black holes that are closer to those existing in the real universe (i.e., rotating black holes enveloped by dark matter). In this paper, we obtained a first-order corrected analytical solution for the black hole event horizon through an approximate solution. The validity of the first-order corrected analytical solution will be provided in the appendix. We conduct our study by introducing a test particle and a scalar field into the black hole. Our conclusions show that, in extremal case, both a test particle and a scalar field can disrupt the event horizon of the Kerr-like black hole; in near-extremal case, both a test particle and a scalar field can disrupt the event horizon of the Kerr-like black hole. When cold dark matter is not considered, the conclusion is consistent with previous research.
While searching at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for the production and decay of the CP-odd scalar (\(A^0\)) in the 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) with Natural Flavour Conservation (NFC) via the channels\(gg\rightarrow A^0\)(through one-loop triangle diagrams) and\(A^0\rightarrow h^0 Z^*\)(with\(m_{h^0} =125\)GeV or\(m_{h^0} < 125\)GeV, withZoff-shell), respectively, a factorisation of the two processes is normally performed, with the\(A^0\)state being on-shell. While this approach is gauge-invariant, it is not capturing the presence of either of the following two channels:\(gg\rightarrow Z^*\rightarrow h^0Z^*\)(through one-loop triangle diagrams) or\(gg\rightarrow h^0Z^*\)(through one-loop box diagrams). As the resolution of the\(A^0\)mass cannot be infinitely precise, we affirm that all such contributions should be computed simultaneously, whichever the\(h^0\)(\(Z^{*}\)) decay(splitting) products, thereby including all possible interferences amongst themselves. The cross section of the ensuing complete process is significantly different from that obtained in the factorisation case, being of the order up to ten percent in either direction at the integrated level and larger (including changes in the shape of kinematical observables) at the differential level. We thus suggest that the complete calculation ought to be performed while searching for\(A^0\)in this channel. We illustrate this need for the case of a 2HDM of Type-I in the inverted hierarchy scenario with\(m_{h^0}<125\)GeV.
We consider a scenario with axions/axion-like particles Chern–Simons gravity coupling, such that gravitational waves can be produced directly from axion wave parametric resonance in the early universe after inflation. This axion gravity term is less constrained compared to the well-searched axion photon coupling and can provide a direct and efficient production channel for gravitational waves. Such stochastic gravitational waves can be detected by either space/ground-based gravitational wave detectors or pulsar timing arrays for a broad range of axion masses and decay constants.
This paper investigates the Joule-Thomson expansion for a five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet Anti-de Sitter black hole. Firstly, by taking Van der Waals gas as an example, we induce the definition of the Joule-Thomson coefficient and the inversion phenomena. One can give theT–Pgraph and the inversion curves. Then, we obtain the thermodynamic properties of the Gauss-Bonnet black hole and use the same way to get theT–Pfigure, which shows differences from Van der Waals gas and other black holes. To our surprise, we can’t observe its inversion phenomena. Due to this reason, we further studied the vanished inversion region and found that the electric charge plays an important role in this phenomenon. We analogy black hole charged and neutral, which get some interesting consequences. Finally, we make Legendre transition to Smarr relation and investigate whether the electric potential has the same result as the electric charge’s landscape. These results will uncover the inner interaction between the enthalpy and the electric charge during the Joule-Thomson process.
Quantum clock synchronization (QCS) can measure out the high-precision clock difference among distant users, which breaks through the standard quantum limit by employing the properties of quantum entanglement. Currently, the wavelength division multiplexed QCS network has been demonstrated with a spontaneous parametric down-conversion entangled photon source. In this paper, we propose a more efficient QCS network scheme with the wavelength multicasting entangled photon source, which can decrease at least 25% of wavelength channel consumption under the identical network scale. Afterwards, a four node QCS network is demonstrated, where the wavelength multicasting entangled photon source is utilized with dual-pumped four-wave mixing silicon chip. The experimental results show that the measured time deviation is 3.4 ps with an average time of 640 s via the multiple fiber links of more than 10 km.
Water activity recorded in asteroids offers a perspective on their habitability. Aqueous alteration, namely the interaction of liquid water with minerals, occurred in the parent body of the C-type asteroid Ryugu. However, Ryugu is not a wet body, and the processes that led to the loss of liquid water along with its chemical environment remain unclear. We report the presence of sodium carbonates, chlorides and sulfates in Ryugu samples, which indicate that alkaline, salt-rich water once flowed through its parent body. Highly concentrated brine probably formed through evaporation or freezing of the liquid water in the final stages of aqueous alteration. Similar processes may have occurred in carbonaceous asteroids in the Solar System, although terrestrial weathering of meteorites might obscure evidence of salt precipitation. Sodium salts could be crucial for comparing the evolved water in carbonaceous bodies and alkaline subsurface oceans in the dwarf planet Ceres and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
\(\varLambda \)-Cold Dark Matter (\(\varLambda \)CDM) has been successful at explaining the large-scale structures in the universe but faces severe issues on smaller scales when compared to observations. Introducing self-interactions between dark matter particles claims to provide a solution to the small-scale issues in the\(\varLambda \)CDM simulations while being consistent with the observations at large scales. The existence of the energy region in which these self-interactions between dark matter particles come close to saturating the S-wave unitarity bound can result in the formation of dark matter bound states called darkonium. In this scenario, all the low energy scattering properties are determined by a single parameter, the inverse scattering length\(\gamma \). In this work, we set bounds on\(\gamma \)by studying the impact of darkonium on the observations at direct detection experiments using data from CRESST-III and XENON1T. The exclusion limits on\(\gamma \)are then subsequently converted to exclusion limits on the self-interaction cross-section and compared with the constraints from astrophysics and N-body simulations.
In this study, we investigate the image of a rotating compact object (CO) illuminated by a geometrically thin, optically thin disk on the equatorial plane. As the radius of the CO’s surface fluctuates, the CO may partially or entirely obscure the photon region. We observe that the perceived photon ring may exhibit discontinuities, deviating from a closed structure, and may even disappear entirely. We find that the disruption and disappearance of the photon ring are dependent on the observational angle-a novel phenomenon not previously observed in black hole imaging studies. Our study reveals that while the factors influencing this unique photon ring phenomenon are diverse and the outcomes complex, we can provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of the physical essence and variation trends of this phenomenon. We do this by introducing and analyzing the properties and interrelationships of three characteristic functions,\(\tilde{\eta }\),\(\eta _o\), and\(\eta _s\)related to the photon impact parameters. Additionally, our analysis of the intensity cuts and inner shadows of the images uncovers patterns that differ significantly from the shadow curve.
We obtained the metric of the Schwarzschild-like black hole with loop quantum gravity (LQG) corrections in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time, under the assumption that the cosmological constant is decoupled in LQG. We investigated its thermodynamics, including the equation of state, criticality, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy. The\(P-v\)graph was plotted, and the critical behavior was calculated. It was found that, due to the LQG effect, the quantum-corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole exhibits a critical point and a critical ratio of 7/18, which differs from the Reissner–Nordstr\(\ddot{\textrm{o}}\)m-AdS black hole’s ratio of 3/8 (the same as that of the Van der Waals system) slightly. However, there are still some similarities compared to the Van der Waals system, such as the same critical exponents and a similar\(P-v\)graph. Moreover, it is concluded that the energy-momentum tensor related to the black hole’s mass could violate the conventional first law of thermodynamics. This modified first law may violate the conservation of Gibbs free energy during the small black hole-large black hole phase transitions, potentially indicating the occurrence of the zeroth-order phase transition. The Joule–Thomson expansion was also studied. Interestingly, compared to the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, the LQG effect leads to inversion points. The inversion curve divides the\(\left( P,T\right) \)coordinate system into two regions: a heating region and a cooling region, as shown in detail by the inversion curves and isenthalpic curves. The results indicated that there is a minimum inversion mass, below which any black hole will not possess an inversion point.
We perform a detailed phenomenological study of high-energy neutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS) focused on LHC far-forward experiments such as FASER\(\nu \)and SND@LHC. To this aim, we parametrise the neutrino fluxes reaching these LHC far-forward experiments in terms of ‘neutrino PDFs’ encoding their energy and rapidity dependence by means of theLHAPDFframework. We integrate these neutrino PDFs in the recently developedPOWHEG-BOX-RESimplementation of neutrino-induced DIS to produce predictions accurate at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the QCD coupling matched to parton showers (PS) withPythia8. We present NLO+PS predictions for final-state distributions within the acceptance for FASER\(\nu \)and SND@LHC as well as for two experiments of the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF), FASER\(\nu \)2 and FLArE. We quantify the impact of NLO QCD corrections, of the parton showering and hadronisation settings inPythia8, of the QED shower, and of the incoming neutrino flavour for the description of these observables, and compare our predictions with theGENIEneutrino event generator. Our work demonstrates the relevance of modern higher-order event generators to achieve the key scientific targets of the LHC neutrino experiments.
In this paper, we investigate the spacetime containing both small-scale structures (wiggles) and spatial dislocation, forming a wiggly cosmic dislocation. We study the combined effects of these features on the dynamics of massive and massless particles. Our results show that while wiggles alone lead to bound states and dislocation introduces angular momentum corrections, their coupling produces more complex effects, influencing both particle motion and wave propagation. Notably, this coupling significantly modifies radial solutions and eigenvalues, with the direction of motion or propagation becoming a critical factor in determining the outcomes. Numerical solutions reveal detailed aspects of particle dynamics as functions of dislocation and string parameters, including plots of trajectories, probability densities, and energy levels. These findings deepen our understanding of how a wiggly cosmic dislocation shapes particle dynamics, suggesting new directions for theoretical exploration in cosmological models.
We show for the first time that rotating wormholes are capable of emitting a Poynting flux in the process of accreting magnetized matter. To this end, we analyze the Damour–Solodukhin metric describing a Kerr-type wormhole and calculate the electromagnetic flux assuming a specific geometry for the magnetic field contained by the wormhole ergosphere. We find that for highly rotating wormholes a mechanism similar to that of Blandford and Znajek is possible, and the emitted electromagnetic flux is of the same order as for a Kerr black hole.
We analyze the extraction of the rotational energy of a Kerr black hole (BH) endowed with a test charge and surrounded by an external test magnetic field and ionized low-density matter. For a magnetic field parallel to the BH spin, electrons move outward(inward) and protons inward(outward) in a region around the BH poles(equator). For zero charge, the polar region comprises spherical polar angles\(-60^\circ \lesssim \theta \lesssim 60^\circ \)and the equatorial region\(60^\circ \lesssim \theta \lesssim 120^\circ \). The polar region shrinks for positive charge, and the equatorial region enlarges. For an isotropic particle density, we argue the BH could experience acyclicbehavior: starting from a zero charge, it accretes more polar protons than equatorial electrons, gaining net positive charge, energy and angular momentum. Then, the shrinking(enlarging) of the polar(equatorial) region makes it accrete more equatorial electrons than polar protons, gaining net negative charge, energy, and angular momentum. In this phase, the BH rotational energy is extracted. The extraction process continues until the new enlargement of the polar region reverses the situation, and the cycle repeats. We show that this electrodynamical process produces a relatively limited increase of the BH irreducible mass compared to gravitational mechanisms like the Penrose process, hence being a more efficient and promising mechanism for extracting the BH rotational energy.
The effect of Hawking radiation on tripartite measurement uncertainty in a Schwarzschild black hole background is analyzed in this study. Two scenarios are examined. In the first, quantum memory particles approach a Schwarzschild black hole and are positioned near the event horizon, while the particle being measured remains in the asymptotically flat region. In the second scenario, the measured particle moves toward the black hole, and the quantum memories stay in the asymptotically flat region. This study considers two initial quantum states, namely GHZ and W states. Our findings reveal that in both cases, measurement uncertainty increases steadily with rising Hawking temperature. When comparing the GHZ and W states, the GHZ state initially exhibits lower measurement uncertainty at low Hawking temperatures than the W state, indicating greater resilience to Hawking radiation. Additionally, when the quantum memories remain in the asymptotically flat region while the measured particle falls toward the black hole, the uncertainties for GHZ and W states do not align at high temperatures. The GHZ state consistently demonstrates lower measurement uncertainty, showcasing its superior robustness against Hawking radiation.
Quantum gravity has been baffling the theoretical physicist for decades now, both for its mathematical obscurity and phenomenological testing. Nevertheless, the new era of precision cosmology presents a promising avenue to test the effects of quantum gravity. In this study, we consider a bottom-up approach. Without resorting to any candidate quantum gravity, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) directly into the cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe sourced by a phantom scalar field with potential to study the evolution of the universe in a very early epoch. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our qualitative analysis shows that the introduction of GUP significantly alters the existence of fixed points for the potential considered in this paper. In addition, we confirm the existence of an inflationary phase and analyze the behavior of relevant cosmological parameters with respect to the strength of the GUP distortion.
A connection between regular black holes and horizonless ultracompact objects was proposed in Carballo-Rubio et al. (JHEP 08:046, 2023,arXiv:2211.05817[gr-qc]). In this paper, we construct a model of a horizonless compact object, specifically an anisotropic gravastar with continuous pressure, that corresponds to regular black hole spacetime in the appropriate limit. The construction begins by modeling an equation of state that satisfies the anisotropic gravastar conditions and transitions to the de Sitter (\(p=-\epsilon \)) upon horizon formation. The spacetime structure is similar to theQuantum Horizonless Compact Object(QHCO) described in Chen and Yokokura (Phys Rev D 109:104058, 2024,arXiv:2403.09388[gr-qc]). Within this model, we also generate images of the corresponding objects surrounded by a thin accretion disk. The resulting images reveal that assuming that the emitting matter exists only outside the object, the inner light ring structure closely resembles that of the horizonless configuration of a regular black hole and the QHCO, yet it exhibits a distinct light ring structure compared to the thin-shell gravastar model. However, the opposite occurs when emitting matter is taken into account inside the object.
The focus of this paper is to investigate the behavior of a codimension-one thick brane in the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity structure\(f(Q, {\mathcal {T}})\), whereQis the nonmetricity scalar and\({\mathcal {T}}\)is the trace of the energy–momentum tensor. Additionally, we examine whether braneworld scenarios are stable under small tensor perturbations and identify the associated massive and resonant modes. Our results indicate that the parameters controlling the modifications to the gravitational model-specifically those affecting nonmetricity and the energy–momentum tensor-significantly influence both the location and existence of these modes.
This work is devoted to exploring the formation and stability of thin-shell wormholes developed through the two similar copies of black holes bounded by the pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo. It is found that the horizon radius of a black hole decreases in the appearance of a pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo. The primary goal of the work is to investigate the stable composition of such wormholes using the analysis of linearized radial perturbation. It is worth mentioning that the existence of a pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo reduces the violation of energy bounds for the developed thin-shell wormholes. We investigate the impact of variable equations of state, such as barotropic, variable Chaplygin, and phantom-like equations of state, on the stability of the wormholes. The inquiry highlights that the appearance of a pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo portrays remarkable importance in preserving the stable compositions of thin-shell wormholes. The wormholes show maximal stable conduct for the selection of pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo as compared to already published research charged as well as regular thin-shell wormholes. The results reveal light on the interplay between wormholes and pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo, which increases our understanding of both conjectures and their potential implications for further space travel.
It is proved that charged thin shells (charged Dyson shells) can be supported in unstablestaticequilibrium states around spherically symmetric central compact objects. The regime of existence of the composed central-compact-object-static-charged-shell configurations is characterized by the inequalities\(\sqrt{m(m+2M)}<|q|<M+\sqrt{M^2+m^2}\), where\(\{m,q\}\)are respectively the proper mass and the electric charge of the supported shell andMis the mass of the central compact object (a black hole or an horizonless compact star). We reveal the physically interesting fact that the supported charged shells become marginally-stable in the\(|q|/\sqrt{m(m+2M)}\rightarrow 1^+\)limit, in which case the lifetime (instability timescale) of the composed system can be made arbitrarily large. Our analysis goes beyond the test shell approximation by properly taking into account the exact gravitational and electromagnetic self-interaction energies of the spherically symmetric shell in the curved spacetime. In particular, the existence of the composed compact-object-charged-shell static configurations in the Einstein–Maxwell theory is attributed to the non-linear electromagnetic self-energy of the supported shell.
We apply Wald’s formalism to a Lagrangian within generalised Proca gravity that admits a Schwarzschild black hole with a non-trivial vector field. The resulting entropy differs from that of the same black hole in General Relativity by a logarithmic correction modulated by the only independent charge of the vector field. We find conditions on this charge to guarantee that the entropy is a non-decreasing function of the black hole area, as is the case in GR. If this requirement is extended to black hole mergers, we find that for Planck scale black holes, a non-decreasing entropy is possible only if the area of the final black hole is several times larger than the initial total area of the merger. Finally, we discuss some implications of the vector Galileon entropy from the point of view of entropic gravity.
We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order,\(M_\textrm{PBH}\sim \mathcal{O}(M_{\odot })\), by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be\(\Delta N_{\textrm{Total}}\sim \mathcal{O}(60)\)and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between\(0.88\leqslant c_{s}\leqslant 1\), allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within\(10^{-3}\leqslant A \leqslant 10^{-2}\), indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small,\(M_{\textrm{PBH}}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot }\), and the large,\(M_{\textrm{PBH}}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot }\), mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.
Extrapolating the Standard Model Higgs potential at high energies, we study the barrier between the electroweak and Planck scale minima. The barrier arises by taking the central values of the relevant experimental inputs, that is the strong coupling constant and the top quark and Higgs masses. We then extend the Standard Model by including a non-minimal coupling to gravity, and explore the phenomenology of the Higgs inflation model. We point out that even configurations that would be metastable in the Standard Model, become viable for inflation if the non-minimal coupling is large enough to flatten the Higgs potential at field values below the barrier; we find that the required value of the non-minimal coupling is smaller than the one needed for the conventional Higgs inflation scenario (which relies on a stable Standard Model Higgs potential, without any barrier); in addition, values of the top mass which are larger than those required in the conventional scenario are allowed.
We present an extension to thePythiaMonte Carlo event generator that enables simulations of collisions between a generic hadron beam on a nuclear target with energy variation in event-by-event basis. This builds uponPythia’s module for heavy ions,Angantyr, as well as previous work on simulating hadron-proton collisions. As such, the extensions in this work are largely technical, except for a rudimentary model for hadronic fluctuations. With hadron-ion simulations, we implement an explicit vector-meson dominance (VMD) model that can be used to simulate interactions of hadronic component of real photons in photo-nuclear collisions. Such processes can be studied in ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions and in the future also with the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider. Our work also has applications to hadronic showers, e.g. air showers initiated by high-energy cosmic rays. We first validate the VMD model by comparing to HERA photoproduction data on proton target. Then we apply this to generate events for ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and present the results corresponding to the event-selection criteria matching to a recent ATLAS analysis. We find that single-particle multiplicity and rapidity distributions are well in line with the measured ones. We also construct the Fourier coefficients from two-particle correlations for the simulated events and study whether the resulting azimuthal anisotropies are consistent with the ATLAS results.
Classical electromagnetic radiation from moving point charges is foundational, but the thermal dynamics responsible for classical acceleration temperature are poorly understood. We investigate the thermal properties of classical electromagnetic radiation in the context of the correspondence between accelerated electrons and moving mirrors, focusing on three trajectories with asymptotically infinite (Davies–Fulling), asymptotically zero (Walker–Davies), and eternally uniform acceleration. The latter two are argued not to be thermal, while the former is found to emit thermal photons with a temperature that depends on the electron’s speed. Thermal radiation occurs in the absence of jerk.
The configuration of a perfect fluid distribution in an electric field under the influence of higher curvature geometric effects introduced through the Gauss–Bonnet invariants is studied in the 4 dimensional Glavan–Lin gravity formulation. It is found that whereas a constant spatially directed gravitational potential gives isothermal behaviour in the standard theory, this is not the case when extra curvature is present in general. A physically viable stellar model is constructed by assuming the Finch–Skea potential. The geometry and electrodynamics are well behaved being regular throughout the distribution including the centre. The model passes stability tests such as the Chandrasekar adiabatic stability criterion and causality. Additionally all energy conditions are satisfied within the star. We compare the performance of the model with its Einstein counterpart and observe that the higher curvature exerts a notable influence on all the physical properties of the star.
Highly forbidden\(\beta \)decays provide a sensitive test to nuclear models in a regime  in which the decay goes through high spin-multipole states, similar to the neutrinoless double-\(\beta \)decay process. There are only 3 nuclei (50V,113Cd,115In) which undergo a\(4^\textrm{th}\)forbidden non-unique\(\beta \)decay. In this work, we compare the experimental113Cd spectrum to theoretical spectral shapes in the framework of the spectrum-shape method. We measured with high precision, with the lowest energy threshold and the best energy resolution ever, the\(\beta \)spectrum of113Cd embedded in a 0.43 kg\(\hbox {CdWO}_4\)crystal, operated over 26 days as a bolometer at low temperature in the Canfranc underground laboratory (Spain). We performed a Bayesian fit of the experimental data to three nuclear models (IBFM-2, MQPM and NSM) allowing the reconstruction of the spectral shape as well as the half-life. The fit has two free parameters, one of which is the effective weak axial-vector coupling constant,\(g_A^{\text {eff}}\), which resulted in\(g_A^{\text {eff}}\)between 1.0 and 1.2, compatible with a possible quenching. Based on the fit, we measured the half-life of the113Cd\(\beta \)decay including systematic uncertainties as\(7.73^{+0.60}_{-0.57} \times 10^{15}\)yr, in agreement with the previous experiments. These results represent a significant step towards a better understanding of low-energy nuclear processes.
An asteroid’s interior dictates how its space environment changes its shape and surface, which provides a record of the collisional and dynamical evolution of the Solar System. Knowledge of asteroid interiors also enables the formulation of mitigation strategies against hazardous asteroids. Despite this importance, asteroid interiors remain poorly understood. Asteroids between 0.2 km and 10 km in diameter are thought to have rubble-pile interiors, transitioning to fractured interiors at 10 km scales, then to coherent and differentiated interiors at ≳100 km scales. The asteroid 433 Eros, the only 10-km-scale asteroid explored by a rendezvous mission, is an exemplar of asteroids at intermediate scales. Recent exploration of smaller rubble piles has provided insight into physical properties that are shared with Eros-sized objects. Here we quantify the seismic and physical properties of Eros’ interior through measurements and modelling of crater degradation and erasure from the impact that formed the 7.5-km-diameter Shoemaker crater on Eros. Our results indicate that Eros’ deep interior has a seismic wave scattering length of 0.5 ± 0.1 km and effective quality factorEQ<\({63}_{-13}^{+18}\)at frequencies >0.06 Hz. Contrary to the established view of Eros as a fractured shard, our findings suggest that Eros’ interior properties are consistent with those of a rubble-pile asteroid.
We propose that the thermodynamics and the kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole enclosed by a cavity can be studied in terms of the free energy landscape formalism. The generalized free energy for the black hole enclosed by a cavity in the canonical ensemble is derived by using the York’s approach, where the temperature on the cavity and the charges inside the cavity are kept as the fixed parameters. By quantifying the corresponding free energy landscape, we obtain the phase diagrams for the black hole in cavity, which reveal a Hawking–Page type transition for the uncharged black hole and a Van der Waals type transition for the charged black hole. We further assume that the dynamics of black hole state switching is mutually determined by the gradient force and the stochastic force arising from the free energy landscape and the thermal noises respectively. We then derive a recurrence relation for then-momentum of the first passage time distribution function, which enables the calculation of the kinetic times characterized by the mean first passage time and its relative fluctuation. Our analysis illustrates that the kinetics of black hole state switching is determined by the ensemble temperature and the barrier height on the free energy landscape.
Black hole (BH) mergers are natural sources of gravitational waves (GWs) and are possibly associated with electromagnetic events. Such events from a charged rotating BH with an accretion on to it could be more energetic and ultra-short-lived if the magnetic force dominates the accretion process because the attraction of ionized fluid with a strong magnetic field around the rotating BH further amplifies the acceleration of the charged particle via a gyromagnetic effect. Thus a stronger magnetic field and gravitational pull will provide an inward force to any fluid displaced in the radial direction and move it toward the axis of rotation with an increasing velocity. After many twists during rotation and the existence of restoring agents, Such events could produce a narrow intense jet starts in the form of Poynting flux along the axis of rotation resembling the Blandford–Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We investigated a charged rotating BH and obtained characteristic results (e.g., the remnant mass, magnetic field strength, luminosity, opening angle, viewing angle, and variation of viewing angle on the SGRB luminosity detection) that have a nice coincidence with rare events having GW associated with EM counterparts. This study gives a new insight into events with a strongly magnetized disk dominating the accretion process of energy extraction.
Recently, the LHCb Collaboration  provided updated measurements for the lepton flavour ratios\(R_K\)and\(R_{K^*}\). The currently observed values align with the predictions of the standard model. In light of these recent updates, our investigation delves into the repercussions of new physics characterized by universal couplings to electrons and muons. We specifically focus on their impact on various observables within the\(B\rightarrow K_2^*(1430)(\rightarrow K\pi )\mu ^+ \mu ^-\)decay. These observables include the differential branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry (\(A_{FB}\)), longitudinal polarization asymmetry (\(F_L\)), and a set of optimized observables (\(P_i\)). Our findings indicate that the branching ratio of\(B\rightarrow K_2^*(\rightarrow K\pi )\mu ^+ \mu ^-\)decay can be suppressed up to\(25\%\)for various new physics solutions. Furthermore, all permissible new physics scenarios demonstrate finite enhancement in the muon forward-backward asymmetry\((A_{FB})\)as well as an increase in the value of the optimized angular observable\(P_2\). Moreover, in the presence of new physics zero crossing points for\(A_{FB}\)and\(P_2\)shift towards higher\(q^2\). The current data have a mild deviation from SM predictions in\(P_5'\)observable in the low-\(q^2\)bin. We also explored massive\(Z'\)models, which can generate universal 1D new physics scenarios, characterized by\(C_9^{NP}<0\),\(C_9^{NP}=-C_{10}^{NP}\), and\(C_9^{NP}=-C_9'\). Using additional constraints coming from\(B_s-\overline{B_s}\)mixing and neutrino trident process, we find that the conclusions of the model-independent analysis remain valid.
We consider a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime having a space of positive curvature and study the cosmic evolution of dynamical vacuum energy. We utilize the dynamical system technique to study the existence of fixed points and their corresponding stability in model. The corresponding cosmological solutions describe late-time accelerating universe having decelerating era composed of radiation and matter-dominated phase. The numerical integration of autonomous system reveals that the cosmological solutions of dynamical vacuum energy model may describe the cosmic history of universe. As a consequence of the dynamical vacuum energy in closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model, the trajectories between fixed points in the phase space would also correspond to the bouncing and turnaround universe evolution.
The relationship between galaxies and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is an area of active research. One way to investigate this relationship is to compare parsec-scale jets formed by SMBHs to the projected shape of their kiloparsec-scale host galaxies. Here we analyse very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) images of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and optical images of their host galaxies by comparing the inner-jet position angle in VLBI-detected radio sources with the optical shapes of galaxies as measured by several large optical surveys. In total, 6,273 galaxy–AGN pairs were found. We carefully account for the systematics of the cross-matched sources and find that Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI LS) data are significantly less affected by them. Using DESI LS data, with which 5,853 galaxy–AGN pairs were cross-matched, we find a weak but significant alignment signal (withP≲ 0.01) between the parsec-scale AGN jet and the kiloparsec-scale projected minor axis of the optical host galaxy in sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts. Our results show that the observed source properties are connected over three orders of magnitude in scale. This finding points towards an intimate connection between a SMBH, its host galaxy and its subsequent evolution.
The James Webb Space Telescope can potentially explore the geological diversity of the surfaces of rocky exoplanets, especially due to its access to mid-infrared wavelengths. Here we investigate the level of geological detail that it could be possible to observe with the low-resolution spectroscopy and photometric modes of the mid-infrared instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. We used new emissivity measurements of 15 basaltic samples between 2 μm and 25 μm to produce synthetic spectra and photometric fluxes. We found that the mid-infrared instrument can, in principle, distinguish several specific mineralogical and bulk chemical signals among relatively similar rocks. In particular, hydrous minerals, such as amphibole and serpentine, which would signal the existence of past or present water, can have observable characteristics in both low-resolution spectroscopy observations (with the precision of 5 eclipses) and the integrated fluxes over mid-infrared instrument filter bandwidths (20–100 eclipses). Photometric fluxes are also sensitive to bulk compositions (for example, wt% Al2O3), which reflect magmatic processes. Our work demonstrates the potential for the James Webb Space Telescope and future observatories to access a fuller picture of exoplanet surface geology.
In this paper, we study the relationship between the phase transition and Lyapunov exponents for 4D Hayward anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole. We consider the motion of massless and massive particles around an unstable circular orbit of the Hayward AdS black hole in the equatorial plane and calculate the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. The phase transition is found to be well described by the multivaled Lyapunov exponents. It is also found that different phases of Hayward AdS black hole coincide with different branches of the Lyapunov exponents. We also study the discontinuous change in the Lyapunov exponents and find that it can serve as an order parameter near the critical point. The critical exponent of change in Lyapunov exponent near the critical point is found to be 1/2.
The Voyager 2 flyby of Uranus in 1986 revealed an unusually oblique and off-centred magnetic field. This single in situ measurement has been the basis of our interpretation of Uranus’s magnetosphere as the canonical extreme magnetosphere of the solar system; with inexplicably intense electron radiation belts and a severely plasma-depleted magnetosphere. However, the role of external forcing by the solar wind has rarely been considered in explaining these observations. Here we revisit the Voyager 2 dataset to show that Voyager 2 observed Uranus’s magnetosphere in an anomalous, compressed state that we estimate to be present less than 5% of the time. If the spacecraft had arrived only a few days earlier, the upstream solar wind dynamic pressure would have been ~20 times lower, resulting in a dramatically different magnetospheric configuration. We postulate that such a compression of the magnetosphere could increase energetic electron fluxes within the radiation belts and empty the magnetosphere of its plasma temporarily. Therefore, the interpretation of Uranus’s magnetosphere as being extreme may simply be a product of a flyby that occurred under extreme upstream solar wind conditions.
Machine learning, particularly neural networks, has rapidly permeated most activities and work where data has a story to tell. Recently, deep learning has started to be used for solving differential equations with input from physics, also known as Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs). Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) applications in numerical relativity remain mostly unexplored. To remedy this situation, we present the first study of applying PINNs to solve in the time domain the Zerilli and the Regge-Wheeler equations for Schwarzschild black hole perturbations. The fundamental difference of our work with other PINN studies in black hole perturbations is that, instead of working in the frequency domain, we solve the equations in the time domain, an approach commonly used in numerical relativity to study initial value problems. To evaluate the accuracy of PINNs results, we compare the extracted quasi-normal modes with those obtained with finite difference methods. For comparable grid setups, the PINN results are similar to those from finite difference methods and differ from those obtained in the frequency domain by a few percent. As with other applications of PINNs for solving partial differential equations, the efficiency of neural networks over other methods emerges when applied to large dimensionality or high complexity problems. Our results support the viability of PINNs in numerical relativity, but more work is needed to assess their performance in problems such as the collision of compact objects.
We examine the black-hole limits of the family of static and spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein field equations for polytropic matter, that was presented in a previous paper. This exploration is done in the asymptotic sub-regions of the allowed regions of the parameter planes of that family of solutions, for a few values of the polytropic indexn, with the limitation that\(n>1\). These allowed regions were determined and discussed in some detail in another previous paper. The characteristics of these limits are examined and analyzed. We find that there are different types of black-hole limits, with specific characteristics involving the local temperature of the matter. We also find that the limits produce a very unexpected but specific type of spacetime geometry in the interior of the black holes, which we analyze in detail. Regarding the spatial part of the interior geometry, we show that in the black-hole limits there is a general collapse of all spatial distances to zero. Regarding the temporal part, there results an infinite overall red shift in the limits, with respect to the flat space at radial infinity, over the whole interior region. The analysis of the interior geometry leads to a very surprising connection with quantum-mechanical studies in the background metric of a naked Schwarzschild black hole. The nature of the solutions in the black-hole limits leads to the definition of a new type of singularity in General Relativity. We argue that the black-hole limits cannot actually be taken all the way to their ultimate conclusion, due to the fact that this would lead to the violation of some essential physical and mathematical conditions. These include questions of consistency of the solutions, questions involving infinite energies, and questions involving violations of the quantum behavior of matter. However, one can still approach these limiting situations to a very significant degree, from the physical standpoint, so that the limits can still be considered, at least for some purposes, as useful and simpler approximate representations of physically realizable configurations with rather extreme properties.
Hyperboloidal slices are spacelike slices that reach future null infinity. Their asymptotic behaviour is different from Cauchy slices, which are traditionally used in numerical relativity simulations. This work uses free evolution of the formally-singular conformally compactified Einstein equations in spherical symmetry. One way to construct gauge conditions suitable for this approach relies on building the gauge source functions from a time-independent background spacetime metric. This background reference metric is set using the height function approach to provide the correct asymptotics of hyperboloidal slices of Minkowski spacetime. The present objective is to study the effect of different choices of height function on hyperboloidal evolutions via the reference metrics used in the gauge conditions. A total of 10 reference metrics for Minkowski are explored, identifying some of their desired features. They include 3 hyperboloidal layer constructions, evolved with the non-linear Einstein equations for the first time. Focus is put on long-term numerical stability of the evolutions, including small initial gauge perturbations. The results will be relevant for future (puncture-type) hyperboloidal evolutions, 3D simulations and the development of coinciding Cauchy and hyperboloidal data, among other applications.
This paper is the initial part of a comprehensive study of spacetimes that admit the canonical forms of Killing tensor in General Relativity. The general scope of the study is to derive either new exact solutions of Einstein’s equations that exhibit hidden symmetries or to identify the hidden symmetries in already known spacetimes that may emerge during the resolution process. In this preliminary paper, we first introduce the canonical forms of Killing tensor, based on a geometrical approach to classify the canonical forms of symmetric 2-rank tensors, as postulated by R. V. Churchill. Subsequently, the derived integrability conditions of the canonical forms serve as additional equations transforming the under-determined system of equations, comprising of Einstein’s Field Equations and the Bianchi Identities (in vacuum with\(\Lambda \)), into an over-determined one. Using a null rotation around the null tetrad frame we manage to simplify the system of equations to the point where the geometric characterization (Petrov Classification) of the extracted solutions can be performed and their null congruences can be characterized geometrically. Therein, we obtain multiple special algebraic solutions according to the Petrov classification (D, III, N, O) where some of them appeared to be new. The latter becomes possible since our analysis is embodied with the usage of the Newman-Penrose formalism of null tetrads.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most widespread compounds in the universe, accounting for up to ~25% of all interstellar carbon. Since most unsubstituted PAHs do not possess permanent electric dipole moments, they are invisible to radio astronomy. Constraining their abundances relies on the detection of polar chemical proxies, such as aromatic nitriles. Here we report the detection of 2-cyanopyrene and 4-cyanopyrene, isomers of the recently detected 1-cyanopyrene. We find that these isomers are present in an abundance ratio of ~2:1:2, which mirrors the number of equivalent sites available for CN addition. We conclude that there is evidence that the cyanopyrene isomers formed by direct CN addition to pyrene under kinetic control in hydrogen-rich gas at 10 K and discuss constraints on the H/CN ratio for PAHs in the Taurus molecular cloud (TMC-1). Our detections of the cyanopyrene isomers suggest that small PAHs like pyrene must be either formed in or transported to the cold interstellar medium, challenging assumptions about the origin and fate of PAHs in space.
In the present paper, the dual symmetries of dense quark matter phase diagram found in some massless three- and two-color NJL models in the mean field approximation have been shown to exist at a more fundamental level as dual transformations of fields and chemical potentials leaving the Lagrangian invariant. As a result, the corresponding dual symmetries of the full phase diagram can be shown without any approximation. And it has been shown not only in the NJL models, but also in framework of two- and three-color massless QCD itself. This is quite interesting, since one might say that it is not very common to show something completely non-perturbatively in QCD.
It’s widely recognized that the free energy landscape captures the essentials of thermodynamic phase transitions. In this work, we extend the findings of [1] by incorporating the nonextensive nature of black hole entropy. Specifically, the connection between black hole phase transitions and the winding number of Riemann surfaces derived through complex analysis is extended to the Rényi entropy framework. This new geometrical and nonextensive formalism is employed to predict the phase portraits of charged-flat black holes within both the canonical and grand canonical ensembles. Furthermore, we elucidate novel relations between the number of sheets comprising the Riemann surface of the Hawking–Page and Van der Waals transitions and the dimensionality of black hole spacetimes. Notably, these new numbers are consistent with those found for charged-AdS black holes in Gibbs–Boltzmann statistics, providing another significant example of the potential connection between the cosmological constant and the nonextensive Rényi parameter.
Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a surprisingly abundant population of faint, dusty active galactic nuclei atz≈ 4–7. Together with the presence of supermassive black holes atz> 6, this raises questions about the formation and growth histories of early black holes. Current theories for the formation of seed black holes from the death of the first stars (that is, light seeds) and/or the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds (that is, heavy seeds) still lack observational confirmation. Here we present LID-568, a low-mass (7.2 × 106M⊙) black hole hosting powerful outflows that is observed in an extreme phase of rapid growth at redshiftz≈ 4. This object is similar to other JWST-discovered faint active galactic nuclei populations, but is bright in X-ray emission and accreting at more than 4,000% of the limit at which radiation pressure exceeds the force of gravitational attraction of the black hole (that is, super-Eddington accretion). Analysis of JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph integral field unit data reveals spatially extended Hα emission with velocities of ~−600–−500 km s−1relative to the central black hole, indicative of robust nuclear-driven outflows. LID-568 represents an elusive low-mass black hole experiencing super-Eddington accretion as invoked by models of early black hole formation. This discovery showcases a previously undiscovered key parameter space and offers crucial insights into rapid black hole growth mechanisms in the early universe.
We investigated the Strong Cosmic Censorship (SCC) conjecture in Einstein–Power–Maxwell–de Sitter (EPMdS) black holes by analyzing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a massless neutral scalar field perturbation. Using the pseudospectral method, we calculated the QNM frequencies across various cosmological constants and nonlinear electromagnetic parameters. Our results show that for black holes far from extremality, the lowest QNM frequency\(-\text {Im} (\omega )/\kappa _-\)remains below 1/2. However, as the black holes approach extremality, the lowest mode’s\(-\text {Im} (\omega )/\kappa _-\)consistently exceeds 1/2, leading to a violation of SCC. Moreover, with a fixed cosmological constant, as the nonlinearity parameter\(\alpha \)increases, the interval of SCC violation under the charge extremality ratio narrows. Considering that\(k = 1/2 + 1/\alpha \)is inversely proportional to\(\alpha \), our results indicate that increasing the orderkof the non-linear electromagnetic field can effectively mitigate SCC violations.
The Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) appears from fundamental symmetries in quantum field theories, but its physical origin is still to be understood. High-precision experimental searches for small PEP violations permit testing key assumptions of the Standard Model with high sensitivity. We report on a dedicated measurement with Gator, a low-background, high-purity germanium detector operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, aimed at testing PEP-violating atomic transitions in lead. The experimental technique, relying on forming a new symmetry state by introducing electrons into the pre-existing electron system through a direct current, satisfies the conditions of the Messiah-Greenberg superselection rule. No PEP violation has been observed, and an upper limit on the PEP violation probability of\(\beta ^2/2 < 4.8 \cdot 10^{-29}\)(90% CL) is set. This improves the previous constraint from a comparable measurement by more than one order of magnitude.
We study dark matter scattering off\( ^4\)He and other light nuclei using chiral effective field theory. We consider scalar DM interactions and include both one- and two-nucleon scattering processes. The DM interactions and nuclear wave functions are obtained from chiral effective field theory and we work up to fourth order in the chiral expansion for the latter to investigate the chiral convergence. The results for the scattering rates can be used to determine the sensitivity of planned experiments to detect relatively light dark matter particles using\( ^4\)He. We find that next-to-leading-order scalar currents are smaller than expected from power counting for scattering off\( ^4\)He confirming earlier work. However, the results for two-nucleon corrections exhibit a linear regulator dependence indicating potential problems in the applied power counting. We observe a linear correlation between the, in principle not observable, D-wave probability of various light nuclei and the scalar two-nucleon matrix elements, again pointing towards potentially missing contributions.
Antinuclei in our Galaxy may stem either from annihilation or decay of dark matter, or from collisions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, which constitute the background of indirect dark matter searches. Understanding the formation mechanism of (anti)nuclei is crucial for setting limits on their production in space. Coalescence models, which describe the formation of light nuclei from final-state interaction of nucleons, have been widely employed in high-energy collisions. In this work, we introduce ToMCCA (ToyMonteCarloCoalescenceAfterburner), which allows for detailed studies of the nuclear formation processes without the overload of general-purpose event generators. ToMCCA contains parameterizations of the multiplicity dependence of the transverse momentum distributions of protons and of the baryon-emitting source size, extracted from ALICE measurements in pp collisions at\(\sqrt{s} = 5 - 13\)TeV, as well as of the event multiplicity distributions, taken from the EPOS event generator. ToMCCA provides predictions of the deuteron transverse momentum distributions, with agreement of\(\sim 5\%\)with the experimental data. The results of ToMCCA show that the coalescence mechanism in pp collisions depends only on the event multiplicity, not on the collision system or its energy. This allows the model to be utilized for predictions at lower center-of-mass collision energies, which are the most relevant for the production of antinuclei from processes related to dark matter. This model can also be extended to heavier nuclei as long as the target nucleus wavefunction and its Wigner function are known.
We discuss the problem of singularity crossing in isotropic and anisotropic universes. We study at which conditions singularities can disappear in quantum cosmology and how quantum particles behave in the vicinity of singularities. Some attempts to develop general approach to the connection between the field reparametrization and the elimination of singularities is presented as well.
In order to explain the mass hierarchy and mixing pattern in the leptonic sector, we explore an extension of the Standard Model whose scalar sector includes one active and two inert doublets as well as some scalar singlets. The model includes a\(S_3\)family symmetry supplemented by extra cyclic symmetries. As a consequence of our construction, a Dark Matter (DM) candidate is predicted and its properties are consistent with the observed cosmic abundances and the constraints imposed by direct and indirect detection experiments. The model allows Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV) processes like\(\mu \rightarrow e\gamma \)and\(\mu \rightarrow 3e\), but the predicted branching ratios align with experimental limits. Additionally, our analysis elucidates the generation of the active neutrino masses through a one-loop radiative seesaw mechanism matching the observed neutrino oscillation data. The model agrees with experimental data on Higgs Diphoton decay rates and on oblique parameters.
Recently, a factorization theorem was proposed for partonic flavor evolution as defined by the net flavor of the Winner-Take-All axis of a jet. We validate the factorization theorem through explicit calculation at two-loop order, and in the process extract all anomalous dimensions and renormalization factors for any ultraviolet-to-infrared flavor transition at this order. These results can then be used to extract the renormalized hard function for flavored jet production at next-to-next-to-leading order for any process of interest.
Our primary goal is to compare the analytic properties of hydrodynamic series with the stability and causality conditions applied to hydrodynamic modes. Analyticity, in this context, serves as a necessary condition for hydrodynamic series to behave as a univalent function. Stability and causality adhere to physical constraints, ensuring that hydrodynamic modes neither exhibit exponential growth nor travel faster than the speed of light. Through an examination of various hydrodynamic models, such as the Müller–Israel–Stewart (MIS) and the first-order hydro models like the BDNK (Bemfica–Disconzi–Noronha–Kovtun) model, we observe no new restrictions stemming from the univalence limits in the shear channels. However, local univalence is maintained in the sound channel of these models despite the global divergence of the hydrodynamic series. Notably, differences in the sound equations between the MIS and BDNK models lead to distinct limits. The MIS model’s sound mode remains univalent at high momenta within a specific transport range. Conversely, in the BDNK model, the univalence of the sound mode extends to intermediate momenta across all stable and causal regions. Generally, the convergence radius is independent of univalence, and the given dispersion relation predominantly influences their correlation. For second-order frequency dispersions, the relationship is precise; i.e., within the convergence radius, the hydro series demonstrates univalence. However, with higher-order dispersions, the hydro series is locally univalent within certain transport regions, which may fall within or outside the stable and causal zones.
We briefly analyzed the equation of state and critical points of the quantum-corrected-AdS black hole and used the Melnikov method to study its thermal chaotic behavior in the extended phase space of flat, closed, and open universes. The results show that the black hole’s thermodynamic behavior is similar to that of the Van der Waals system. Although the critical ratios at the critical points in the three types of universes differ, they are all independent of the quantum correction parameter. Only an open universe can attain the critical ratio of\(\frac{3}{8}\)corresponding to the Van der Waals system, while in the other two universes, the critical ratio is always greater than this value. For chaos, time perturbations will lead to chaotic behavior when their amplitude exceeds a critical value that depends on the quantum correction parameter and the radius of the dust sphere in the FRW model. Based on this, we found that the chaotic behavior of the black hole varies across different universes depending on the quantum correction parameter, but this parameter always makes chaos more likely. Using the value of the quantum correction parameter determined by Meissner, chaos is always more difficult to occur in an open universe compared to the other two types of universes. Which universe is most prone to chaos depends on the radius of the dust sphere. Finally, chaotic behavior is always present under spatial perturbations.
In recent times, the study of the Casimir effect in quantum field theory has garnered increasing attention because of its potential to be an ideal source of exotic matter needed for stabilizing traversable wormholes. It has been confirmed through experimental evidence that this phenomenon involves fluctuations in the vacuum field, leading to a negative energy density. Motivated by the above, we have investigated Casimir wormholes with corrections from the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) within the framework of matter-coupled teleparallel gravity. Our analysis includes three well-known GUP models: the Kempf, Mangano, and Mann (KMM) model, the Detournay, Gabriel, and Spindel (DGS) model, and a third model called Model II. For a broader analysis, we have considered two well-known model functions for the teleparallel theory: a linear\(f(T,\mathcal {T})=\alpha T+\beta \mathcal {T}\)and a quadratic model\(f(T,\mathcal {T})=\eta T^2+\chi \mathcal {T}\). The shape function solutions corresponding to both models are examined in the absence of tidal forces in spacetime. We also demonstrate the crucial role played by the parameters of the\(f(T,\mathcal {T})\)models in the violation of the energy conditions. With the increasing interest in detecting gravitational waves from astrophysical objects, we have thoroughly discussed the perturbation of the wormhole solutions in the scalar, electromagnetic, axial gravitational, and Dirac field backgrounds. We employ the 3rd order WKB expansion to find the complex frequencies associated with the quasinormal modes of energy dissipation. Additionally, we also calculate the active mass and total gravitational energy for the wormhole geometry. The amount of exotic matter involved in sustaining these wormholes is also found in this paper. Furthermore, the physical stability of such Casimir wormholes is examined using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation.
Building on previous work, we extend an algebraic realisation of three fermion generations within the complex Clifford algebra\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\)by incorporating a\(U(1)_{em}\)gauge symmetry. The algebra\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\)corresponds to the algebra of complex linear maps from the (complexification of the) Cayley–Dickson algebra of sedenions,\(\mathbb {S}\), to itself. Previous work represented three generations of fermions with\(SU(3)_C\)colour symmetry permuted by an\(S_3\)symmetry of order-three, but failed to include aU(1) generator that assigns the correct electric charge to all states. Furthermore, the three generations suffered from a degree of linear dependence between states. By generalising the embedding of the discrete group\(S_3\), corresponding to automorphisms of\(\mathbb {S}\), into\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\), we include an\(S_3\)-invariantU(1) that correctly assigns electric charge. First-generation states are represented in terms of two even\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\)semi-spinors, obtained from two minimal left ideals, related to each other via the order-two\(S_3\)symmetry. The remaining two generations are obtained by applying the\(S_3\)symmetry of order-three to the first generation. In this model, the gauge symmetries,\(SU(3)_C\times U(1)_{em}\), are\(S_3\)-invariant and preserve the semi-spinors. As a result of the generalised embedding of the\(S_3\)automorphisms of\(\mathbb {S}\)into\(\mathbb {C}\ell (8)\), the three generations are now linearly independent.
State-of-the-art simulations of high-energy nuclear collisions rely on hybrid setups, involving in particular a pre-equilibrium stage to let the system evolve from a far-from-equilibrium initial condition towards a near-equilibrated state after which fluid dynamics can be applied meaningfully. A known issue is the mismatch between the equation of state in the fluid-dynamical evolution and the effective one in the previous stage, which leads to discontinuities at the interface between the two models. Here we introduce a new matching prescription at this interface, based on the entropy, and we compare it with the standard one relying on local energy conservation. We study the behavior of various quantities at the switching time between the models and investigate a number of final-state hadronic observables. For the latter, we show that they are not modified significantly by the choice of matching prescription, provided an appropriate normalization is chosen for the initial state. In turn, our approach reduces sizeably the ratio of bulk over thermodynamic pressure at the beginning of the fluid-dynamical stage.
In this paper, we explore the quantum properties of three-flavor neutrino propagating in a Schwarzschild metric. It is found that the different strength of gravitational effects are obtained by adjusting the magnitude of\(\mathrm GM\)arising in the oscillation phase. Using the weak field approximations, we show that the gravitational effects can make the entanglement oscillates over a large rage when\(\textrm{GM}=5.1\times 10^8 \, \textrm{Km}\)and\(\textrm{GM}=7\times 10^7 \, \textrm{Km}\), respectively, Moreover, for\(\textrm{GM}=4.8\times 10^8 \, \textrm{Km}\)and\(\textrm{GM}=9.3\times 10^7 \, \textrm{Km}\), the suppression of the entanglement can be observed due to the gravitational effects. Meanwhile, in this case, the gravitational effects also make the distribution of entanglement tighter through investing the entanglement complete monogamy relation. Furthermore, we examine the gravitational effects on the violation of the Svetlichny inequality to study the nonlocality of the system. It is shown that when\(\textrm{GM}=6\times 10^8 \, \textrm{Km}\)and\(\textrm{GM}=7\times 10^7 \, \textrm{Km}\), the gravitational effects make the Svetlichny parameters always greater than 4, implying that the genuine tripartite nonlocality of the system is always present. However, the gravitational effects also restrain the violation of the Svetlichny to make the regions of the absence of nonlocality increase. The gravitational effects on the monogamy property of nonlocality lies in the change of the effective bound of the maximum bipartite nonlocality of the neutrinos system. Therefore, our investigations may be helpful to understanding of quantumness of the neutrinos system in curved space-time.
The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered a surprising population of bright galaxies in the very early Universe (≲500 Myr after the Big Bang) that is hard to explain with conventional galaxy-formation models and whose physical properties are not fully understood. Insight into their internal physics is best captured through nebular lines, but at these early epochs, the brightest of these spectral features are redshifted into the mid-infrared and remain elusive. Using the mid-infrared instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope, here we present a detection of Hα and doubly ionized oxygen ([Oiii] 4959,5007 Å) from the bright, ultra-high-redshift galaxy candidate GHZ2/GLASS-z12. Based on these emission lines, we infer a spectroscopic redshift ofz= 12.33 ± 0.04, placing this galaxy just ~400 Myr after the Big Bang. These observations provide key insights into the conditions of this primaeval, luminous galaxy, which shows hard ionizing conditions rarely seen in the local Universe and probably driven by a compact and young burst (≲30 Myr) of star formation. The galaxy’s oxygen-to-hydrogen abundance is close to a tenth of the solar value, indicating a rapid metal enrichment. This study establishes the unique conditions of this notably bright and distant galaxy and the huge potential of mid-infrared observations to characterize these primordial systems.
Inspired by the great progress in the observations of charmonium-like states in recent years, we perform a systematic analysis about the ground states and the first radially excited states of\(qc\bar{q}\bar{c}\)(q=u/dands) tetraquark systems. Their mass spectra, root mean square (r.m.s.) radii and radial density distributions are predicted within the framework of relativized quark model. By comparing with experimental data, some potential candidates for hidden-charm tetraquark states are suggested. For\(qc\bar{q}\bar{c}\)(q=u/d) system, if\(Z_{c}(3900)\)is supposed to be a compact tetraquark state with\(J^{PC}=1^{+-}\),Z(4430) can be interpreted as the first radially excited states of\(Z_{c}(3900)\). Another broad structure\(Z_{c}(4200)\)can also be explained as a partner of\(Z_{c}(3900)\), and it arise from a higher state with\(J^{PC}=1^{+-}\). In addition, theoretical predictions indicate that the possible assignments forX(3930),X(4050) andX(4250) are low lying\(0^{++}\)tetraquark states. As for the\(sc\bar{s}\bar{c}\)system,X(4140) andX(4274) structures can be interpreted as this type of tetraquark states with\(J^{PC}=1^{++}\), andX(4350) can be described as a\(sc\bar{s}\bar{c}\)tetraquark with\(J^{PC}=0^{++}\). With regard to\(qc\bar{s}\bar{c}\)(q=u/d) system, we find two potential candidates for this type of tetraquark, which are\(Z_{cs}(4000)\)and\(Z_{cs}(4220)\)structures. The measured masses of these two structures are in agreement with theoretical predictions for the\(1^{+}\)state.
This paper describes measurements of the transverse momentum spectra ofWandZbosons produced in proton–proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of\(\sqrt{s}=5.02\)TeV and\(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Measurements are performed in the electron and muon channels,\(W\rightarrow \ell \nu \)and\(Z\rightarrow \ell \ell \)(\(\ell =e\)or\(\mu \)), and forWevents further separated by charge. The data were collected in 2017 and 2018, in dedicated runs with reduced instantaneous luminosity, and correspond to 255 and 338\(\hbox {pb}^{-1}\)at\(\sqrt{s}=5.02\)TeV and 13 TeV, respectively. These conditions optimise the reconstruction of theW-boson transverse momentum. The distributions observed in the electron and muon channels are unfolded, combined, and compared to QCD calculations based on parton shower Monte Carlo event generators and analytical resummation. The description of the transverse momentum distributions by Monte Carlo event generators is imperfect and shows significant differences largely common to\(W^-\),\(W^+\)andZproduction. The agreement is better at\(\sqrt{s}=5.02\)TeV, especially for predictions that were tuned toZproduction data at\(\sqrt{s}=7\)TeV. Higher-order, resummed predictions based onDYTurbogenerally match the data best across the spectra. Distribution ratios are also presented and test the understanding of differences between the production processes.
Nearly one-third of objects occupying the most circular, coplanar Kuiper belt orbits (the cold classical belt) are binary, and several percent of them are ‘ultra-wide’ binaries (UWBs): ~100-km-sized companions spaced by tens of thousands of kilometres. UWBs are dynamically fragile, and their existence is thought to constrain the early Solar System processes and conditions. However, we demonstrate that UWBs can instead attain their wide architectures well after the earliest epochs of the Solar System, when the orbital migration of Neptune implants the modern non-cold, or ‘dynamic’, Kuiper belt population. During this implantation, cold classical belt binaries are likely to have close encounters with many planetesimals scattered across the region, which can efficiently dissociate any existing UWBs and widen a small fraction of tighter binaries into UWB-like arrangements. Thus, today’s UWBs may not be primordial and cannot be used to constrain the early Solar System as directly as previously surmised.
We give a family of exact solutions of\(N=1\)supergravity field equations in\(D=4\)dimensions that describe the collision of plane-fronted gravitino waves.
The CYGNO experiment aims to build a large (\(\mathcal {O}(10)\)m\(^3\)) directional detector for rare event searches, such as nuclear recoils (NRs) induced by dark matter (DM), such as weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs). The detector concept comprises a time projection chamber (TPC), filled with a He:CF\(_4\)60/40 scintillating gas mixture at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, equipped with an amplification stage made of a stack of three gas electron multipliers (GEMs) which are coupled to an optical readout. The latter consists in scientific CMOS (sCMOS) cameras and photomultipliers tubes (PMTs). The maximisation of the light yield of the amplification stage plays a major role in the determination of the energy threshold of the experiment. In this paper, we simulate the effect of the addition of a strong electric field below the last GEM plane on the GEM field structure and we experimentally test it by means of a 10\(\times \)10 cm\(^2\)readout area prototype. The experimental measurements analyse stacks of different GEMs and helium concentrations in the gas mixture combined with this extra electric field, studying their performances in terms of light yield, energy resolution and intrinsic diffusion. It is found that the use of this additional electric field permits large light yield increases without degrading intrinsic characteristics of the amplification stage with respect to the regular use of GEMs.
In this paper, we study the discovery potential of a Vector-LikeBquark (VLB) via the process\(pp \rightarrow B(\rightarrow bZ)j\rightarrow b(Z \rightarrow \nu _l\bar{\nu _l})j\)at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with\(\sqrt{s}=14\)TeV. In the framework of a simplified model, we perform a scan over its parameter space and test its viability following a Monte Carlo analysis developed to include all production and decay dynamics. We use cut-and-count combined with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) methods to classify the signal and background events in order to improve the efficiency of signal identification and background rejection. We find that this approach can reduce background events significantly while the signal retention rate is much higher than that of traditional methods, thereby improving the VLB discovery potential. We then calculate the exclusion and discovery capabilities for VLBs and find that the advantages of the cut-and-count plus XGBoost method especially lie in the high-mass region, i.e.,\(m_B > 1500 \text { GeV}\). We finally obtain the following LHC results in terms of the coupling and chiral structure of a singlet heavy VLB interactions: (i) for\(g^{*}=0.2\)and\(R_L=0\)with 3000 fb\(^{-1}\), theBquark mass can be be excluded (discovered) up to 3000 GeV (2500 GeV); (ii) for\(g^{*}=0.2\)and\(R_L=0.5\)with 3000 fb\(^{-1}\), the exclusion (discovery) region can reach up to 4750 GeV (4250 GeV).
Motivated by the impact of the phantom field (or anti-Maxwell field) on the structure of three-dimensional black holes in the presence of the cosmological constant, we present the first extraction of solutions for the phantom BTZ (A)dS black hole. In this study, we analyze the effect of the phantom field on the horizon structure. Furthermore, we compare the BTZ black holes in the presence of both the phantom and Maxwell fields. Additionally, we calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the phantom BTZ black holes, demonstrating their compliance with the first law of thermodynamics. Subsequently, we assess the effects of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on the local stability in the canonical ensemble by considering these fields with respect to the heat capacity. We then investigate the global stability area of the BTZ black holes with phantom and Maxwell fields within the grand canonical ensemble using Gibbs free energy. In this analysis, we evaluate the influence of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on this area.
Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE\(\nu \)NS) poses an irreducible background in the search for dark matter-nucleus elastic scatterings, which is commonly known as the neutrino floor. As direct dark matter search experiments keep improving their sensitivity into so far unexplored regions, they face the challenge of approaching this neutrino floor. A precise description of the CE\(\nu \)NS signal is therefore crucial for the description of backgrounds for future DM searches. In this work we discuss the scenario of detecting neutrinos in low-threshold, high-exposure cryogenic solid state experiments optimized for the search of low-mass dark matter. The energy range considered is completely dominated by solar neutrinos. In absence of any dark matter events, we treat solar neutrinos as the main signal of interest. We show that sensitivity to the flux of neutrinos from different production mechanisms can be achieved. In particular we investigate the sensitivity to the flux of pp and\(^{7}\)Be neutrinos, as well as CNO neutrinos. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity to dark matter signals in the presence of a solar neutrino background for different experimental scenarios, which are defined by three parameters: the target material, the energy threshold and the exposure. We show that experiments with thresholds of\(\mathcal {O}\)(eV) and exposures of\(\mathcal {O}\)(tonne-years), using\(\hbox {CaWO}_{4}\)or\(\hbox {Al}_{2}\hbox {O}_{3}\)targets, have discovery potential for dark matter interaction cross sections in the neutrino floor.
We study the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon,\(g_\mu - 2 \equiv 2 a_\mu \), in the context of supersymmetric models beyond the CMSSM, where the unification of either the gaugino masses\(M_{1,2,3}\)or sfermion and Higgs masses is relaxed, taking into account the measured mass of the Higgs boson,\(m_H\), the cosmological dark matter density and the direct detection rate. We find that the model with non-unified gaugino masses can make a contribution\(\Delta a_\mu \sim 20 \times 10^{-10}\)to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, for example if\(M_{1,2} \sim 600\; \textrm{GeV}\)and\(M_3\sim 8 \; \textrm{TeV}\). The model with non-universal sfermion and Higgs masses can provide even larger\(\Delta a_\mu \sim 24 \times 10^{-10}\)if the sfermion masses for the first and the second generations are\( \sim 400 \; \textrm{GeV}\)and that of the third is\( \sim 8 \; \textrm{TeV}\). We discuss the prospects for collider searches for supersymmetric particles in specific benchmark scenarios illustrating these possibilities, focusing in particular on the prospects for detecting the lighter smuon and the lightest neutralino.
In this paper, we investigate the time dependent black holes in the frame of Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet theory having two scalar fields and investigate the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW). In the reconstructed models, there often appear ghosts, which could be eliminated by imposing some constraints. We investigate the behavior of high-frequency gravitational waves by examining the effects of varying Gauss–Bonnet coupling during their propagation. The speed of propagation changes due to the coupling during the black hole formation process. The propagation speed of gravitational waves differs when they enter the black hole compared to when they exit.
Testing possible variations in fundamental constants of nature is a crucial endeavor in observational cosmology. This paper investigates potential cosmological variations in the fine structure constant (\(\alpha \)) through a non-parametric approach, using galaxy cluster observations as the primary cosmological probe. We employ two methodologies based on galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements derived from X-ray and Sunyaev–Zeldovich observations, along with luminosity distances from type Ia supernovae. We also explore how different values of the Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) impact the variation of\(\alpha \)across cosmic history. When using the Planck satellite’s\(H_0\)observations, a constant\(\alpha \)is ruled out at approximately the 3\(\sigma \)confidence level for\(z \lesssim 0.5\). Conversely, employing local estimates of\(H_0\)restores agreement with a constant\(\alpha \).
We study the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon,\(g_\mu - 2 \equiv 2 a_\mu \), in the context of supersymmetric models beyond the CMSSM, where the unification of either the gaugino masses\(M_{1,2,3}\)or sfermion and Higgs masses is relaxed, taking into account the measured mass of the Higgs boson,\(m_H\), the cosmological dark matter density and the direct detection rate. We find that the model with non-unified gaugino masses can make a contribution\(\Delta a_\mu \sim 20 \times 10^{-10}\)to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, for example if\(M_{1,2} \sim 600\; \textrm{GeV}\)and\(M_3\sim 8 \; \textrm{TeV}\). The model with non-universal sfermion and Higgs masses can provide even larger\(\Delta a_\mu \sim 24 \times 10^{-10}\)if the sfermion masses for the first and the second generations are\( \sim 400 \; \textrm{GeV}\)and that of the third is\( \sim 8 \; \textrm{TeV}\). We discuss the prospects for collider searches for supersymmetric particles in specific benchmark scenarios illustrating these possibilities, focusing in particular on the prospects for detecting the lighter smuon and the lightest neutralino.
Astrophysical fluids subjected to the strong gravity of black holes can form rotating toroidal-like structures known as thick accretion discs. In order to facilitate the study of such structures, we introduce approximate empirical formulae for a relatively simple analytical description of their poloidal cross-sections that are usually described only numerically. Our comparisons of the approximate and exact descriptions of the cross-sections of the structures rotating around Schwarzschild and Kerr central black holes, together with the determination of the associated total masses of these structure, indicate a high degree of accuracy for these introduced formulae.
Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are a powerful tool for testing gravity theories, probing gravitational and electromagnetic field properties, and obtaining constraints on the black hole and field parameters. This work considers charged particle dynamics near uniformly magnetized black holes in braneworlds. First, we obtain the solution of the Maxwell equation for magnetic fields and calculate the radial and angular magnetic field components. We derive and analyze the effective potential of charged particles for circular orbits and investigate the energy and angular momentum for the circular orbits. We also analyze the combined effects of magnetic interaction and braneworlds on the charged particles’ innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). We calculate the angular momentum of charged particles in Keplerian orbits in the presence of an external magnetic field and braneworlds. Also, we investigate frequencies of the particle oscillations along vertical and angular directions. We applied our studies on particle oscillations to the QPO studies in the relativistic precession model. Finally, we obtain constraints on magnetic interaction and braneworld parameters together with the black hole mass and QPO orbits using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation in the four-dimensional parameter space for the QPOs observed in the microquasars XTE J1550-564, GRO J1655-40 & GRS 1915-105, and at the center of galaxies M82 and Milky Way.
The operational framework for the superposition of spacetime is fundamentally important in developing a comprehensive description of quantum gravity (Foo et al. in Phys Rev Lett 129:181301, 2022). As a “bottom-up” unifying theory of quantum gravity, it allows us to investigate how mass superposition of spacetime influences the performance of quantum information processing. In this paper, we study how the quantum-gravitational effects produced by the mass superposition of a black hole influence the quantum coherence of fermionic fields. It is shown that the spacetime effects associated with a classical black hole lead to inevitable decoherence. Notably, compared to classical black hole spacetime scenarios, fermionic fields near a black hole with superposed masses can retain more quantum coherence. This suggests that the quantum properties of spacetime may serve as resources to mitigate coherent degradation caused by gravitational effects. The bottom-up perspective on spacetime superposition proposed in this work serves as an indication of quantum-gravitational effects and holds significant theoretical implications.
The late-time behaviour of the solutions of the Fackerell–Ipser equation (which is a wave equation for the spin-zero component of the electromagnetic field strength tensor) on the closure of the domain of outer communication of sub-extremal Kerr spacetime is studied numerically. Within the Kerr family, the case of Schwarzschild background is also considered. Horizon-penetrating compactified hyperboloidal coordinates are used, which allow the behaviour of the solutions to be observed at the event horizon and at future null infinity as well. For the initial data, pure multipole configurations that have compact support and are either stationary or non-stationary are taken. It is found that with such initial data the solutions of the Fackerell–Ipser equation converge at late times either to a known static solution (up to a constant factor) or to zero. As the limit is approached, the solutions exhibit a quasinormal ringdown and finally a power-law decay. The exponents characterizing the power-law decay of the spherical harmonic components of the field variable are extracted from the numerical data for various values of the parameters of the initial data, and based on the results a proposal for a Price’s law relevant to the Fackerell–Ipser equation is made. Certain conserved energy and angular momentum currents are used to verify the numerical implementation of the underlying mathematical model. In the construction of these currents a discrete symmetry of the Fackerell–Ipser equation, which is the product of an equatorial reflection and a complex conjugation, is also taken into account.
We explore the entanglement dynamics of two detectors undergoing uniform acceleration and circular motion within a massive scalar field, while also investigating the influence of the anti-Unruh effect on entanglement harvesting. Contrary to the conventional understanding of the weak anti-Unruh effect, where entanglement typically increases, we observe that the maximum entanglement between detectors does not exhibit a strict monotonic dependence on detector acceleration. Particularly at low accelerations, fluctuations in the entanglement maxima show a strong correlation with fluctuations in detector transition rates. We also find that the maximum entanglement of detectors tends to increase with smaller field mass. Novelly, our findings indicate the absence of a strong anti-Unruh effect in (3+1)-dimensional massive scalar fields. Instead, thermal effects arising from acceleration contribute to a decrease in the detector entanglement maximum.
In this study, we present an exact solution to the Einstein field equations, featuring a static, spherically symmetric, anisotropic compact stellar fluid sphere with non-zero complexity. The model is constructed using a specific metric potential for the\(g_{tt}\)component, along with a defined complexity profile. The model parameters are fixed by ensuring the continuity of the interior and exterior metrics across the surface of the star and by setting the radial pressure to zero across the boundary. The stability of the model has been analyzed by verification of different standard conditions. Validation of our model is supported by recent observational data from well-known pulsars.
Semileptonic three-body\(D \rightarrow M\ell ^+\nu _\ell \)decays, non-leptonic\(M \rightarrow VP\)decays, and semileptonic four-body\(D \rightarrow M(M \rightarrow VP)\ell ^+\nu _\ell \)decays are analyzed using the SU(3) flavor symmetry/breaking approach, where\(\ell =e/\mu \),\(M=A/T\), andA/T/V/Pdenote the axial-vector/tensor/vector/pseudoscalar mesons, respectively. In terms of SU(3) flavor symmetry/breaking, the decay amplitudes of the\(D \rightarrow M \ell ^+ \nu _\ell \)decays and the vertex coefficients of the\(M \rightarrow VP\)decays are related. The relevant non-perturbative parameters of the\(D \rightarrow A\ell ^+\nu _\ell \),\(A \rightarrow VP\), and\(T \rightarrow VP\)decays are constrained by the present experimental data, and the non-perturbative parameters of\(D \rightarrow T\ell ^+\nu _\ell \)decays are taken from the results in the light-front quark model since no experimental data are available at present. The branching ratios of the\(D \rightarrow M \ell ^+ \nu _\ell \),\(M \rightarrow VP\), and\(D\rightarrow M(M\rightarrow VP)\ell ^+\nu _\ell \)decays are then predicted. We find that some processes receive both tensor and axial-vector resonant contributions, while other processes receive only axial-vector resonant contributions. In cases where both kinds of resonant contributions exist, the axial-vector contributions are dominant. Some branching ratios with axial-vector resonance states are large, and they may be measured experimentally in the near future. In addition, the sensitivities of the branching ratios of\(D \rightarrow A \ell ^+ \nu _\ell \)and\(A \rightarrow VP\)decays to the parameters are also investigated, and some decay branching ratios are found to be sensitive to the non-perturbative parameters.
The recent anomaly observed in NO\(\nu \)A and T2K experiments in standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation could potentially signal physics extending beyond the standard model (SM). For the NSI parameters that can accommodate this anomaly, we explore the violation of Leggett–Garg type inequalities (LGtI) within the context of three-flavor neutrino oscillations. Our analysis focuses on LGtI violations in scenarios involving complex NSI with\(\epsilon _{e\mu }\)or\(\epsilon _{e\tau }\)coupling in long baseline accelerator experiments for normal and inverted mass ordering. LGtI violation is significantly enhanced in normal ordering (NO) for\(\epsilon _{e\tau }\)scenario for T2K, NO\(\nu \)A, and DUNE experiment set-up. We find that for inverted ordering (IO), in the DUNE experimental set-up above 8.5 GeV, the LGtI violation can be an indication of\(\epsilon _{e\tau }\)new physics scenario.
We study the production of hyperon resonances in the\(p\bar{p}\rightarrow \bar{\Lambda }\Sigma \eta \)reaction within an effective Lagrangian approach. The model includes the production of\(\Sigma (1750)\)and\(\Lambda (1670)\)in the intermediate state excited by theKand\(K^*\)meson exchanges between the initial proton and antiproton. Due to the large coupling of\(\Sigma (1750)\Sigma \eta \)vertex,\(\Sigma (1750)\)is found a significant contribution near the threshold in this reaction. We provide total and differential cross section predictions for the reaction and discuss the possible influence of\(\Sigma (1750)\Sigma \eta \)vertex coupling and model parameters, which will be useful in future experimental studies. This reaction can provide a platform for studying the features of\(\Sigma (1750)\)resonance, especially the coupling to\(\Sigma \eta \)channel.
Understanding the behavior of the matter power spectrum on non-linear scales beyond the\(\Lambda \)CDM model is crucial for accurately predicting the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe in non-standard cosmologies. In this work, we present an analysis of the non-linear matter power spectrum within the framework of interacting dark energy-dark matter cosmologies (IDE). We employ N-body simulations and theoretical models to investigate the impact of IDE on these non-linear scales. Beginning with N-body simulations characterized by a fixed parameter space delineated by prior observational research, we adeptly fit the simulated spectra with a simple parametric function, achieving accuracy within 5%. Subsequently, we refine a modified halo model tailored to the IDE cosmology, exhibiting exceptional precision in fitting the simulations down to scales of approximately 1 h/Mpc. To assess the model’s robustness, we conduct a forecast analysis for the Euclid survey, employing our refined model. We find that the coupling parameter\(\xi \)will be constrained to\(\sigma (\xi ) = 0.0110\). This marks a significant improvement by an order of magnitude compared to any other current observational tests documented in the literature. These primary findings pave the way for a novel preliminary approach, enabling the utilization of IDE models for observational constraints concerning LSS data on non-linear scales.
In traditional QCD sum rules, the simple hadron spectral density model of the “delta-function-type ground state + theta-function-type continuous spectrum” determines that there is no perfect parameter selection. In recent years, inverse problem methods, particularly the inverse matrix method, have shown better handling of QCD sum rules. This work continues to develop the inverse matrix method. Considering that the narrow-width approximation may still be a good approximation, we separate the ground state from the spectral density. We then follow the general steps of the inverse matrix method to extract physical quantities such as decay constants that we may be more interested in.
This paper reports a summary of searches for a fermionic dark matter candidate in the context of theoretical models characterised by a mediator particle  exchange in thes-channel. The data sample considered consists ofppcollisions delivered by the Large Hadron Collider during its Run 2 at a centre-of-mass energy of\(\sqrt{s} = 13\,\textrm{TeV}\)and recorded by the ATLAS detector, corresponding to up to 140 fb\(^{-1}\). The interpretations of the results are based on simplified models where the new mediator particles can be spin-0, with scalar or pseudo-scalar couplings to fermions, or spin-1, with vector or axial-vector couplings to fermions. Exclusion limits are obtained from various searches characterised by final states with resonant production of Standard Model particles, or production of Standard Model particles in association with large missing transverse momentum.
In this study, we explore the transformation of\(D_p\)-branes to\(D_{p-1}\)-branes under T-duality when theD-brane is embedded in a spacetime with a boundary. Our goal is to derive the higher-derivative corrections to the Dirac–Born–Infeld (DBI) Lagrangian for both the bulk and boundary terms. For the bulk terms, we calculate the\(\alpha '\)corrections for the massless open string fields, up to the 8th order in the dimensionless Maxwell field strength. We demonstrate that the bulk Lagrangian can satisfy the T-duality constraint without residual total derivative terms in the base space. This determines the most general independent couplings of the massless open string fields in the bulk Lagrangian, encompassing 145 coupling constants, up to three parameters. Two of these parameters are physical and are determined by disk-level S-matrix elements, while the third is unphysical and can be eliminated by field redefinitions and integration by parts. The final result for the bulk Lagrangian consists of 49 couplings. For the boundary terms, the application of T-duality symmetry to massless open and closed string fields enables us to extend the DBI Lagrangian to include the boundary unit normal vector field\(n_\mu \)and its first derivative.
The Weyl typef(Q,T) gravity is the modification off(Q) gravity andf(Q,T) theories, where non-metricity is denoted byQandTis the trace of the energy–momentum tensor. Together with a geometric explanation for dark energy, the theory can provide an exact interpretation of the transformation of the late-time Universe and the observable data. In this study, we present an accelerated cosmic model of the Universe inf(Q,T) gravity. We consider the model off(Q,T) gravity as,\(f(Q,T) = -Q+\phi (Q,T)\). We examine the energy condition for the model off(Q,T) gravity and find out that our model satisfies the null and strong energy conditions at the same time, it violates the weak and dominant energy conditions. After that, we perform the phase-space study of our cosmological model with and without interaction independently. In case of the absence of interaction, we get six critical points out of which three critical points are stable critical points while the rest three critical points are saddle. When we perform the stability analysis in the presence of interaction, we get three critical points out of which one critical point is stable while the rest two are saddle points. The phase-plot analysis also shows the cosmological models inf(Q,T) gravity.
The discovery of the top quark, the most massive elementary particle yet known, has given us a distinct window into investigating the physics of the Standard Model and beyond. With a plethora of top quarks to be produced in the high luminosity era of the LHC, the exploration of its rare decays holds great promise in revealing potential new physics phenomena. We consider higher-dimensional operators contributing to flavour-changing-neutral-current top decays in the SMEFT and its extension by a light singlet species of spin 0, 1/2, or 1, and exhibit that the HL-LHC (and other future colliders) may observe many exotic top decays in a variety of channels. Light singlets which primarily talk to the SM through such a top interaction may also lead to distinctive long-lived particle signals. Searching for such long-lived particles in top-quark decays has the additional advantage that the SM decay of the other top quark in the same event provides a natural trigger.
The holographic dark energy (HDE) model resides in quantum gravity in connection with the entropy, which requires an appropriate IR-cutoff to support the accelerating universe. Of these, the BHDE is corresponding to the quantum-corrected Barrow entropy\(S_{B}\propto A^{1+\Delta /2}\)for which the Granda–Oliveros (GO) IR-cutoff\(L_{IR}=(\alpha H^2 + \beta \dot{H})^{-\frac{1}{2}}\)avoids the causality problem of the typically used future event-horizon. As the cosmological evolution of the model has recently been studied, we include the relic-neutrinos to constraint the well-motivated model’s parameters (\(\alpha , \beta , \Delta \)) along with the total mass of neutrinos\(\sum m_{\nu }\)and the effective number of their species\(N_{eff}\)using a variety of the latest observational data. Utilizing the basic observations from 2018 Planck CMB-data, BAO-data, Pantheon sample of type Ia supernovae (SNIa),H(z) measurements of cosmic chronometers (CC) and various combinations of them, we find\(\sum m_{\nu } < 0.119\)eV (95 % CL) for CMB + ALL combination, aligning with\(\sum m_{\nu } < 0.12\)eV, (95% CL) of 2018 Planck release plus BAO data. The value of\(N_{eff}=2.98^{+0.25}_{-0.25}\)(68% CL) is also determined which is consistent with BAO+Planck’s\(N_{eff}=2.99^{+0.17}_{-0.17}\)(68% CL). The AIC analysis shows that the model (especially its\(\alpha =1\)case) is (mildly) favored over the concordance\(\Lambda \)CDM for that complete combination. Furthermore, the Barrow–Granda–Oliveros parameters are found in using the above datasets, as they get\(\alpha =0.98^{+0.06}_{-0.06}\),\(\beta =0.597^{+0.07}_{-0.08}\)and\(\Delta =0.0054^{+0.0076}_{-0.0076}\)for CMB + ALL combination, where are in agreement with previous studies. The use of these best-fitting values in plotting the deceleration parameterq(z) shows that the universe undergoes a deceleration-acceleration transition at\(z_{tr}=0.63\), by entering the current phase of dark-energy domination with\(q_0=-\,0.573\).
We study possible hints towards confinement in a\(\hbox {Z}_2\)-invariant Yukawa system with massless fermions and a real scalar field in the strongly-coupled regime. Using the tools developed for studying non-perturbative physics via Jacobi elliptical functions, for a given but not unique choice of the vacuum state, we find the exact Green’s function for the scalar sector so that, after integrating out the scalar degrees of freedom, we are able to recover the low-energy limit of the theory that is a fully non-local Nambu–Jona–Lasinio (NJL) model. We provide an analytical result for the renormalization group (RG) running of the self-interaction coupling in the scalar sector in the strongly-coupled regime. In the fermion sector, we provide some clues towards confinement, after deriving the gap equation with the non-local NJL model, a property which is well-known to not emerge in the local limit of this model. We conclude that, for the scalar-Yukawa theory in the non-perturbative domain with our choice of the vacuum state, the fundamental fermions of the theory form bound states and cannot be observed as asymptotic states.
Condensation processes, which are responsible for the main chemical differences between gas and solids in the Galaxy, are the major mechanisms that control the cycle of dust from evolved stars to planetary systems. However, they are still poorly understood, mainly because the thermodynamics and kinetic models of nucleation or grain growth lack experimental data. To bridge this gap, we used a large-volume three-phase alternating-current plasma torch to obtain a full high-temperature condensation sequence at an elevated carbon-to-oxygen ratio from a fluxed chondritic gas composition. We show that the crystallized suites of carbides, silicides, nitrides, sulfides, oxides and silicates and the bulk composition of the condensates are properly modelled by a kinetically inhibited condensation scenario controlled by gas flow. This validates the thermodynamic predictions of the condensation sequence at a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio. On this basis and using appropriate optical properties, we also demonstrate the influence of pressure on dust chemistry as well as the low probability of forming and detecting iron silicides in asymptotic giant branch C-rich circumstellar environments as well as in our chondritic meteorites. By demonstrating the potential of predicting dust mineralogy in these environments, this approach holds high promise for quantitatively characterizing dust composition and formation in diverse astrophysical settings.
Accretion processes near black hole candidates are associated with the high-energy emission of radiation from relativistic particles and outflows. It is widely believed that the magnetic field plays a crucial role in explaining these high-energy processes near these astrophysical sources. In this work, we analyze thin accretion disks in the Bocharova–Bronnikov–Melnikov–Bekenstein (BBMB) spacetime framework using the Novikov–Thorne model. Our study examines the thermal and optical characteristics of these disks, including their emission rate and luminosity in the specified spacetime. Later, we extend the Novikov–Thorne model to ionized thin accretion disk. We propose that the black hole is embedded in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. We investigate the dynamics of charged particles near a weakly magnetized black hole. Our findings show that, in the presence of a magnetic field, the radius of the marginally stable circular orbit (MSCO) for a charged particle is close to the black hole’s horizon. The orbital velocity of the charged particle, as measured by a local observer, has been computed in the presence of the external magnetic field. We also present an analytical expression for the four-acceleration of the charged particle orbiting around black holes. Finally, we determine the intensity of the radiation emitted by the accelerating relativistic charged particle orbiting the magnetized black hole.
We develop an effective and methodical algorithm for the construction of general covariant four-point\(H\ell \ell Z\)vertices, accommodating leptons\(\ell =e, \mu \), and designed to handle a bosonHof any integer spin, not merely confined to spins up to 2. While our numerical analysis assumes theH-boson mass to be\(m_H=125\,\textrm{GeV}\), the analytical framework we propose is versatile, enabling the examination of various mass as well as spin scenarios. These meticulously devised general covariant four-point\(H\ell \ell Z\)vertices are pivotal in vetoing all the imposters of the Standard Model Higgs boson holding the spin-0 and even-parity quantum numbers, especially in one of its primary decay channels, the three-body decay process\(H\rightarrow \ell ^-\ell ^+ Z\), observable at the Large Hadron Collider. Our innovative strategy encompasses the analysis of all the effectively allowed scenarios, extending beyond the limitations of previous investigations on the Higgs spin and parity determinations in the decay\(H \rightarrow \ell ^-\ell ^+ Z\). Based on the significantly expanded scheme, we demonstrate that the Higgs boson imposter of any spin and parity can be definitively vetoed by leveraging angular and invariant mass distributions focusing on threshold effects. Even though achieving such conclusive results in practical and exhaustive analyses may necessitate high event rates, especially in the spin-0 contact-interaction case.
The decay of theDmeson into multibody final states is a complex process that provides valuable insights into the fundamental interactions within the Standard Model of particle physics. This study focuses on the decay cascade\(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}_{J} \ell ^{+}\nu \rightarrow K^{\pm }\pi ^{\mp } \ell ^{+}\nu \)where the\(K^*_J\)resonance encompasses the\(K^*(892),K^{*}(1410),K^{*}_0(1430)\)states. We employ the helicity amplitude technique to derive the angular distributions for the decay chain, enabling the extraction of one-dimensional and two-dimensional distributions. Utilizing form factors for the\(D\rightarrow K^*\)transition derived from the quark model, we calculate the differential and integrated partial decay widths, explicitly considering the electron and muon masses. Decay branching fractions are calculated, the ratios of the branching fractions are found to be\(\frac{\mathcal {B}r(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}(892)(\rightarrow K ^{-}\pi ^{+}) \, \mu ^{+}\nu _{\mu })}{\mathcal {B}r(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}(892)(\rightarrow K ^{-}\pi ^{+}) \, e^{+}\nu _{e})} = 0.975\),\(\frac{\mathcal {B}r(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}(1410)(\rightarrow K ^{-}\pi ^{+}) \, \mu ^{+}\nu _{\mu })}{\mathcal {B}r(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}(1410)(\rightarrow K ^{-}\pi ^{+}) \, e^{+}\nu _{e})} = 0.714\)and\(\frac{\mathcal {B}r(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}_{0}(1430)(\rightarrow K ^{+}\pi ^{-}) \, \mu ^{+}\nu _{\mu })}{\mathcal {B}r(D^{+}\rightarrow K^{*}_{0}(1430)(\rightarrow K ^{+}\pi ^{-}) \, e^{+}\nu _{e})} = 0.774\). Results in this work will serve a calibration for the study of\(c \rightarrow s \)inDmeson decays in future and provide useful information towards the understanding of the properties of the\(K^{*}\)meson, as well as\(K \pi \)system.
In this paper, we explore cosmological bouncing solutions to investigate the cosmic evolution in the framework of energy-momentum squared gravity. We consider flat Friedmann–Robertson–Walker spacetime with a perfect matter distribution. We assume two different functional forms of\(f(\mathcal {R},T^2)\)gravity model to examine the impact of this modified framework in the evolution of the universe. Furthermore, we consider a specific scale factor to investigate different cosmological parameters, analyzing the evolutionary behavior of the universe in this gravity. We also perform stability analysis using the perturbation technique. Our findings indicate that the null energy condition violates at the bounce point and equation of state parameter exhibits characteristics of a quintessence era or phantom regimes. These aspects highlight the complex interplay between energy conditions and stability in bouncing cosmological model. We conclude that the\(f(\mathcal {R},T^2)\)theory successfully provides viable alternatives to the standard cosmological scenarios, offering insights into the early universe and the nature of gravity.
In a dimensionless multi-scalar extension of the Standard Model, Gildener and Weinberg assumed that along a flat direction, there is only one classically massless scalar, known as thescalon, which acquires mass through radiative corrections à la Coleman–Weinberg, while all other scalars remain heavy. In this paper, by introducing a toy model with four scalar degrees of freedom we demonstrate the existence oftwoscalons along a specific flat direction that we construct. We present the effective potential for the model and provide the masses of the heavy scalars and two radiatively light pseudo-Goldstone bosons.
In this work, we construct charged AdS black holes with a global monopole charge in diverse dimensions and study the thermodynamics. We find a critical monopole charge below which the solution exhibits Van-der Waals like behaviors. In the context of holography, this could be interpreted using the boundary degrees of freedoms. As an example, we study the phase diagram in the four dimensions analytically. We further analyze the microstructures of the solution using Ruppeiner geometry. We find that repulsive interactions dominates for black holes in a wide range of temperatures. However, around the critical point, attractive interactions is dominant and the Ruppeiner scalar curvature shows universal behaviors: it has a critical exponent 2 and coefficient\(-1/8\)in diverse dimensions. Universality of the results is interpreted from the scaling behavior of free energy near the critical point for Van-der Waals like fluids.
Dating the ages and weighting the stellar populations in galaxies are essential steps when studying galaxy formation through cosmic times. Evolutionary population synthesis models with different input physics are used for this purpose. Moreover, the contribution from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stellar phase, which peaks for intermediate-age 0.6–2 Gyr systems, has been debated for decades. Here we report the detection of strong cool-star signatures in the rest-frame near-infrared spectra of three young (~1 Gyr), massive (~1010M⊙) quiescent galaxies at large look-back time,z= 1–2, using JWST/NIRSpec. The coexistence of oxygen- and carbon-type absorption features, spectral edges and features from rare species, such as vanadium and possibly zirconium, reveal a strong contribution from TP-AGB stars. Population synthesis models with a significant TP-AGB contribution reproduce the observations better than those with a weak TP-AGB, which are commonly used. These findings call for revisions of published stellar population fitting results, as they point to populations with lower masses and younger ages and have further implications for cosmic dust production and chemical enrichment. New generations of improved models are needed, informed by these and future observations.
We derive the equation governing the axial-perturbations in the space-time of a non-rotating uncharged primordial black hole (PBH), produced in early Universe, whose metric has been taken as the generalized McVittie metric. The generalized McVittie metric is a cosmological black hole metric, proposed by Faraoni and Jacques in 2007 (Phys. Rev. D 76:063510, 2007). This describes the space-time of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in FLRW-Universe, while allowing its mass-change. Our derivation has basic similarities with the procedure of derivation of Chandrasekhar, for deriving the Regge-Wheeler equation for Schwarzschild metric (Chandrasekhar The Mathematical Theory of Black holes, Oxford University Press, New York, 1983); but it has some distinct differences with that due to the complexity and time-dependency of the generalized McVittie metric. We show that after applying some approximations which are very well valid in the early radiation-dominated Universe, the overall equation governing the axial perturbations can be separated into radial and angular parts, among which the radial part is the intended one, as the angular part is identical to the case of Schwarzschild metric as expected. We identify the potential from the Schrödinger-like format of the equation and draw some physical interpretation from it.
Using an extended theory of General Relativity that incorporates normalized relativistic velocities, where the boundary terms in the varied Einstein–Hilbert action are considered. Within this context, I investigate the dynamic evolution of a collapsing spherical system characterized by a metric with spatial curvature and variable time-scale, aiming to describe the process of Gravastar formation. To illustrate the system’s dynamics, I analyze a power-law collapsing scenario and derive the equation of state for both cases, with and without geometrical perturbations. In particular, I derive the equation of state, incorporating back-reaction effects related with the boundary terms of the varied Einstein–Hilbert action.
The Fourier harmonics,\(v_2\)and\(v_3\)of negative pions are measured at center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of\(\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}\)= 17.3 GeV around midrapidity by the CERES/NA45 experiment at the CERN SPS in 0–30% central PbAu collisions with a mean centrality of 5.5%. The analysis is performed in two centrality bins as a function of the transverse momentum\(\mathrm {p_{\textrm{T}}}\)from 0.05 GeV/cto more than 2 GeV/c. This is the first measurement of the\(v^{1/3}_{3}/v^{1/2}_{2}\)ratio as a function of transverse momentum at SPS energies, that reveals, independently of the hydrodynamic models, hydrodynamic behavior of the formed system. For\(\mathrm {p_{\textrm{T}}}\)above 0.5 GeV/c, the ratio is nearly flat in accordance with the hydrodynamic prediction and as previously observed by the ATLAS and ALICE experiments at the much higher LHC energies. The results are also compared with the SMASH-vHLLE hybrid model predictions, as well as with the SMASH model applied alone.
In this paper, we have presented a power law cosmological model and its dynamical system analysis in\(f(T,\phi )\)gravity, whereTis the torsion scalar and\(\phi \)is the canonical scalar field. The two well-motivated forms of the non-minimal coupling function\(F(\phi )\), the exponential form and the power law form, with exponential scalar field potential, are investigated. The dynamical system analysis is performed by establishing the dimensionless dynamical variables, and the critical points were obtained. The evolution of standard density parameters is analysed for each case. The behaviour of the equation of state (EoS) and deceleration parameter agree with the result of recent cosmological observations. The model parameters are constrained using the existence and the stability conditions of the critical points describing different epochs of the evolution of the Universe.
One of the strongest tools to verify the predictions of general relativity (GR) has been the gravitational lensing around various compact objects. Using a dual charged stringy black hole produced from dilaton-Maxwell gravity, we investigate the impact of the plasma parameter on gravitational lensing and black hole shadow in this study. Detailed investigations are performed to mark the impact of the homogeneous and non-homogeneous plasma environment on the electric and magnetic charge parameters of stringy black hole. In order to compare the results, we have also considered the vacuum scenario of the dual charged stringy black hole. Our results show that the effect of homogeneous plasma environment is much stronger in comparison to vacuum for the case of electrically charged stringy black hole. However, in the case of magnetically charged stringy black hole, the deflection angle gets decreased in presence of the homogeneous plasma medium. It has been observed that the radius of the shadow increases in a non-homogeneous plasma environment for electrically charged stringy black hole, whereas it decreases for magnetically charged stringy black hole in presence of the same plasma environment. This study aims to investigate how different plasma environments influence these fascinating astrophysical phenomena.
We study a particular Einstein–Maxwell–Dilaton black hole configuration with cosmological constant, expressed in terms of the curvature radius, from the point of view of quasi-homogeneous thermodynamics. In particular, we show that the curvature radius and the coupling constant of the matter fields can be treated as thermodynamic variables in the framework of extended thermodynamics, leading in both cases to a van der Waals-like behavior. We also investigate in detail the stability and critical properties of the black holes and obtain results, which are compatible with the mean field approach.
We develop a formalism of poly-vector deformations for Type IIB backgrounds with a block diagonal metric and non-vanishing self-dual 5-form RR field strength. Making use of the embedding of the Type IIB theory into the\(\textrm{E}_{6(6)}\)exceptional field theory we derive explicit transformation rules for four-vector deformations. We prove that the algebraic condition following from the Type IIB realization of exceptional Drinfeld algebras is sufficient for the transformation to generate a solution.
We investigate the properties of compact objects in thef(Q,T) theory, where\(\mathcal {Q}\)is the non-metricity scalar and\({ \mathcal {T}}\)is the trace of the energy–momentum tensor. We derive an interior analytical solution for anisotropic perfect-fluid spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium using the linear form of\(f(\mathcal {Q}, { \mathcal {T}})=\mathcal {Q}+\psi { \mathcal {T}}\), where\(\psi \)represents a dimensional parameter. Based on the observational constraints related to the mass and radius of the pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021,\(\psi \)is set to a maximum negative value of\(\psi _1=\psi / \kappa ^2=-0.04\), where\(\kappa ^2\)is the gravitational coupling constant. The solution results in a stable compact object, which does not violate the speed of sound condition\(c_s^2\le \frac{c^2}{3}\). The effective equation of state is similar to the quark matter equation of state, and involves the presence of an effective bag constant. When\(\psi \)is negative, the star has a slightly larger size as compared to GR stars with the same mass. The difference in the predicted star size between the theory with a negative\(\psi \)and GR for the same mass is attributed to an additional force appearing in the hydrodynamic equilibrium equation. The maximum compactness allowed by the strong energy condition for\(f(\mathcal {Q}, { \mathcal {T}})\)theory and for GR is\(C = 0.514\)and 0.419, respectively, with the\(f(\mathcal {Q}, { \mathcal {T}})\)prediction about\(10\%\)higher than the GR one. Assuming a surface density at saturation nuclear density of\(\rho _{\text {nuc}} = 4\times 10^{14}~\hbox {g}/\hbox {cm}^3\), the maximum mass of the star is\(4.66 M_\odot \), with a radius of 14.9 km.
We study the prospect of heavy singlet neutrinos as a dark matter (DM) candidate within a neutrinophilicU(1) model, where the Standard Model (SM) is extended with aU(1) gauge symmetry, and neutrino mass and oscillation parameters are explained through an inverse see-saw mechanism. The lightest of the heavy neutrinos plays the role of the DM, while the newly introduced scalars and the extra gauge boson\(Z'\)act as mediators between the dark sector and the SM sector. We show the range of model parameters where this DM candidate can be accommodated in the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) or Feebly Interacting Massive Particle (FIMP) scenario. The observed DM relic density (DMRD) is achieved via the new gauge boson and singlet scalar portals in the WIMP scenario, whereas within the FIMP scenario, these two particles assume a distinct yet pivotal role in generating the observed DMRD.
The geometric trinity of gravity comprises three distinct formulations of general relativity: (i) the standard formulation describing gravity in terms of spacetime curvature, (ii) the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity describing gravity in terms of spacetime torsion, and (iii) the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (STEGR) describing gravity in terms of spacetime non-metricity. In this article, we complete a geometric trinity of non-relativistic gravity, by (a) taking the non-relativistic limit of STEGR to determine its non-relativistic analogue, and (b) demonstrating that this non-metric theory is equivalent to Newton–Cartan theory and its teleparallel equivalent, i.e., the curvature and the torsion based non-relativistic theories that are both geometrised versions of classical Newtonian gravity.
AbstractBased on the results of several articles devoted to the study of the average power spectra (<PDS>) of γ-ray bursts (GRBs), a list of <PDS> features has been compiled that need to be explained. Using the possibility, proven in a number of publications, of decomposing the time profile of each γ-ray burst into the sum of several two-sided pulses, GRB modeling is performed in the time domain and the study of the average power spectra of models is carried out in the frequency domain. Brief reviews of the results of a number of theoretical works are made. A Monte Carlo simulation of time series consisting of a set of two-sided pulses with a Poisson distribution of the position of the pulses on the time scale, with different pulse shapes and distributions of amplitude and pulse duration, was carried out. All the basic properties of the average power spectrum in the form of a quasi-Lorentzian theoretically derived in various published studies have been confirmed. <PDS> of superposition of two-sided pulses randomly distributed over time are not described by a single power law. In general, the <PDS> shape consists of three quasi-power sections separated by two breaks. The position of the two breaks in the <PDS> is determined by the parameters of asymmetry and the effective pulse duration. The pulse-duration distribution and their shape affect the shape of the <PDS>, and the pulse amplitude distribution has practically no such effect. The amount of intermittency (at large values of γ ≥ 1) affects the shape of the <PDS>. Based on previous theoretical work and the Monte Carlo simulations carried out in this study, it can be argued that all the features of the average power spectra of GRBs are explained using a simple light curve model in the form of a superposition of uncorrelated random two-sided pulses. The main features of the <PDS> of GRBs are determined only by such pulse characteristics as the asymmetry parameter, the duration distribution, and the shape of the pulses.
AbstractWe consider the planar circular restricted four-body problem. A small body of negligible mass moves in the Newtonian gravitational field of three attracting massive bodies (primaries). The primaries are located at the triangular libration points of a plane circular restricted three-body problem, i.e. they move in circular orbits and form an equilateral triangle. All four bodies move in a plane. It is assumed the stability of these triangular libration points are stable, that is the Routh’s necessary stability condition is fulfilled. The equations of motion of the planar restricted circular four-body problem admit particular solutions describing the so-called central configurations, in which all four bodies form a quadrilateral of constant form and size. If the Routh’s necessary stability condition is satisfied, then eight central configurations are possible, of which three can be stable in the linear approximation. By using the method of normal form and KAM theory, we performed nonlinear analysis of the stability of these central configurations. A numerical analysis of the coefficients of the Hamiltonian normal form of the equations of perturbed motion was performed and rigorous conclusions about stability were obtained. In the limiting case, when one of the three attracting bodies is small, analytical expressions for the coefficients of the Hamiltonian normal form were obtained by using method of the small parameter. It is shown that the results of analytical and numerical stability studies are in good agreement.
We consider a counter-rotating torus orbiting a central Kerr black hole (BH) with dimensionless spina, and its accretion flow into theBH, in an agglomerate of an outer counter-rotating torus and an inner co-rotating torus. This work focus is the analysis of the inter-disks inversion surfaces. Inversion surfaces are spacetime surfaces, defined by the condition\(u^{\phi }=0\)on the flow torodial velocity, located out of theBHergoregion, and totally embedding theBH. They emerge as a necessary condition, related to the spacetime frame-dragging, for the counter-rotating flows into the central KerrBH. In our analysis we study the inversion surfaces of the Kerr spacetimes for the counter-rotating flow from the outer torus, impacting on the inner co-rotating disk. Being totally or partially embedded in (internal to) the inversion surfaces, the inner co-rotating torus (or jet) could be totally or in part “shielded”, respectively, from the impact with flow with\(a u^{\phi }<0\). We prove that, in general, in the spacetimes with\(a<0.551\)the co-rotating toroids are always external to the accretion flows inversion surfaces. For\(0.551<a<0.886\), co-rotating toroids could be partially internal (with the disk inner region, including the inner edge) in the flow inversion surface. ForBHswith\(a>0.886\), a co-rotating torus could be entirely embedded in the inversion surface and, for larger spins, it is internal to the inversion surfaces. Tori orbiting in theBHouter ergoregion are a particular case. Further constraints on theBHsspins are discussed in the article.
The effects of cosmological expansion on quantum bosonic states are investigated, using quantum information theory. In particular, a generic Bogoliubov transformation of bosonic field modes is considered and the state change on a single mode is regarded as the effect of a quantum channel. Properties and capacities of this channel are thus explored in the framework off(Q) non-metric gravity. The reason is that non-metric gravity can be considered under the standard of gauge theories with all the advantages of such a formulation. As immediate result, we obtain that the information on a single-mode state appears better preserved, whenever the number of particles produced by the cosmological expansion is small. Specifically, we investigate a power lawf(Q) model, leaving unaltered the effective gravitational coupling, and minimise the corresponding particle production. We thus show how to optimise the preservation of classical and quantum information, stored in bosonic mode states in the remote past. Finally, we compare our findings with those obtained in General Relativity.

Slipping motions of magnetic field lines are a distinct signature of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection, a fundamental process driving solar and stellar flares. While being a key prediction of numerical experiments, the rapid super-Alfvénic field line slippage driven by the ‘slip-running’ reconnection has remained elusive in previous observations. New frontiers into exploring transient flare phenomena were introduced by recently designed high cadence observing programs of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). By exploiting high temporal resolution imagery (~2 s) of IRIS, here we reveal slipping motions of flare kernels at speeds reaching thousands of kilometres per second. The fast kernel motions are direct evidence of slip-running reconnection in quasi-separatrix layers, regions where magnetic field strongly changes its connectivity. Our results provide observational proof of theoretical predictions unaddressed for nearly two decades and extend the range of magnetic field configurations where reconnection-related phenomena can occur.
AbstractThe paper proposes a method for constructing trajectories for launching a spacecraft into a circular polar orbit of an artificial Moon satellite (AMS) based on the use of the properties of invariant manifolds of solutions to the circular restricted three-body problem. This approach, in comparison with the classical Hohmann transfer, makes it possible to significantly reduce the braking impulse by increasing the flight time. The process of constructing flight orbits includes two stages. At the first stage, solutions to the circular restricted three-body problem are analyzed, as a result of which the least costly options for entering the AMS orbit are selected. At the second stage, orbits corresponding to the found options and passing at a given distance from the Earth are constructed in the ephemeris model of the Solar System. The developed method was applied to analyze the possibilities of flights to polar orbits of the AMS with an altitude of 150 km in 2030. Options for entering the orbit of the AMS are described corresponding to the braking impulse values of 619.5 and 623.3 m/s with a flight duration of 111 days and 93 days, respectively.
AbstractThe paper formulates a methodology for reducing the general problem of optimal spacecraft control to a problem of reinforcement machine learning. The methodology includes a method for assessing the quality of a control algorithm based on probability theory inequalities. An author’s software toolbox is presented for reducing optimal control problems to reinforcement learning. Two examples of application of the methodology are considered. The proposed technique may also be of interest for general mechanical systems control design.
AbstractIn this paper, expressions for high-precision simulation of multi-GNSS observations received in low Earth orbit are given. Based on this observation model, the real spacecraft orbit was refined. Based on real data from the GRACE space project, the results were compared with simulated measurements from foreign software. The average deviation in determining the spacecraft location was 18 mm, which confirms the correctness of the described observation model.
AbstractWhen solving the problems of dynamics in space of EP’s plasma jets, it is necessary to take into account the influence of the Earth’s magnetic field on the formation of a plasma stream (EP-electric propulsion). It is shown that under the influence of a geomagnetic field, plasma jets acquire specific three—dimensional shapes at some distance from the source, biconvex plasma petals—“corsunoids.” The strength of such influence is determined by a parameter of electromagnetic interaction—the Ampere parameter equal to a scale of the ratio of a transverse electromagnetic force to a pressure gradient.
AbstractOn October 9, 2022, orbiting X-ray and γ-ray telescopes registered the most powerful explosion ever observed in the Universe—the GRB221009A γ-ray burst at a distance of 2.4 billion light years. The response of the Earth’s ionosphere to this unique event was detected in the received signals of very-low-frequency (VLF) radio paths passing through both the daytime and nighttime ionosphere. A disturbance in the night sector was observed as a sudden decrease in amplitude up to 7 dB and a sharp jump in the signal phase up to 20°‒30°. Less pronounced amplitude jumps up to 1.5 dB were found in the daytime sector. At the time of the flare, magnetometers showed only the appearance of a weak burst of the geomagnetic field ∼0.5 nT at the time of the flare. In the daytime, an isolated geomagnetic pulse with an amplitude of up to 1 nT was observed. The appearance of a geomagnetic response to a γ-ray flare is surprising, because its radiation creates additional ionization in the stratosphere, significantly below the conducting E-layer of the ionosphere. The recorded event showed that extragalactic γ-ray bursts cause a noticeable perturbation in the Earth’s ionosphere, and the network of VLF radio paths covering the lower ionosphere can be considered as a giant γ-ray detector.
We present a fully automated implementation of next-to-leading order electroweak (NLO EW) corrections in the logarithmic approximation in OpenLoops. For energies above the electroweak scale NLO EW corrections are logarithmically enhanced and in tails of kinematic distributions of crucial LHC processes yield correction factors of several tens of percent. The implementation of the logarithmic Sudakov EW approximation in the amplitude generator OpenLoops is fully general, largely model independent, it supports the computation of EW corrections to resonant processes, and it is suitable for extensions to the two-loop NNLO EW level. The implementation is based on an efficient representation of the logarithmic approximation in terms of an effective vertex approach. Investigating a set of representative LHC processes we find excellent agreement between the logarithmic approximation and full one-loop results in observables where the assumptions of the EW Sudakov approximation are fulfilled.
The connection between the equivalence principle and Noether’s theorem was discussed in Capozziello and Ferrara (Int J Geom Methods Mod Phys 21:2440014, 2024). However, it is known that the Noether symmetry condition is independent of the equations of motions as follows from Hamilton’s principle. In this paper, we critically examine the analysis presented in the aforementioned work, highlighting its flaws, and provide a detailed demonstration that there is no connection between Noether’s theorem and the equivalence principle. Furthermore, we offer various insights on symmetry analysis to prevent the perpetuation of inaccuracies regarding Noether’s work.
AbstractThe article presents the results of an experimental study of the strength properties of samples obtained by laser melting from powder compositions of a lunar regolith simulant based on gabbro-diabase. The powder compositions have been obtained by sieving with a fraction range of 50–100 and 100–140 μm from a simulant with a grain-size distribution similar to that of natural regolith. Their properties have been studied on experimental samples with characteristic dimensions of 7.5 × 5 × 6 mm3: apparent density, hardness, and compressive strength in different melting modes. Dependences of these properties on the energy density were obtained in the range from 12 to 25 J/mm3. The measured Vickers hardness of samples fused from a composition of 50–100 μm had a range of 691–830HV, and samples from a composition of 100–140 μm had a wider range: 330–830HV. The maximum values of compressive strength for samples from both compositions reached 17–20 MPa with median values of 12 and 17 MPa for the first and second compositions, respectively. These values are quite consistent with those that could be obtained by the process of in situ resource utilization.
AbstractThe features of the infrared (IR) spectra of various isotopic forms of water (–OH, –OD, H2O, HDO, and D2O) included in the crystal structure of the main rock-forming minerals of lunar basalts—olivines (forsterite)—have been studied. The results of numerical modeling (CUSTEP/Biovia Materials Studio) and experimental studies using the FT-801 IR Fourier spectrometer with a plug-in using the method of disturbed internal reflection (Simex, Novosibirsk) are presented. Numerical calculations have shown that forsterite can contain hydroxyl groups –OH(D) in its crystal lattice under certain conditions. The possibility of retaining various isotopic forms of molecular water on the surface of forsterite has been experimentally verified and the corresponding IR spectra of the mineral with a water film have been obtained. The IR spectra of forsterite containing isotopologues of water obtained theoretically and experimentally are compared with the observations of theChandrayaan-1andSOFIAartificial lunar satellites.
Abstract3U CubeSat stabilization towards the Sun is analyzed. The satellite is equipped with solar telescope of the vacuum ultraviolet spectrum. Stabilization of the optical axis of the telescope is achieved through the use of either reaction wheels or magnetorquers. The desired level of stabilization accuracy is set at two angular minutes per second. Performance of both control systems is compared on a Sun synchronous orbit. The study formulates the necessary operational conditions for the satellite’s successful functioning and establishes the key parameters of its control systems.
AbstractThe paper presents the results of laboratory tests of selective laser melting (SLM) of powder compositions of lunar regolith simulants from the terrestrial rocks of gabbro-diabase and labradorite, which have different ranges of fractionality. It is shown that compositions with narrow ranges of fractionality of either 50–100 or 100–140 μm make it possible to produce the samples with rather good properties: relatively low porosity and rather good compliance with the requested geometric shape. Experimental dependences of the porosity of tested samples on the energy density of melting are obtained. For both cases of powder compositions from gabbro-diabase with the narrow fractions, either 50–100 or 100–140 μm, the dependences on the energy are practically the same: with increasing energy density up to 20 J/mm3and greater, the porosity approaches 30–35%. On the other hand, experimental tests shown that SLM technology for a powder composition with a broad range of fractions, from 0 to 100 μm, does not allow testing samples with acceptable properties to be produced—either with low porosity and with reasonable consistency with the specified geometry.
AbstractThe correction of the trajectory of a two-impulse launch of a spacecraft into a high circular orbit of an artificial Moon satellite is considered, taking into account errors in determining the position and speed of the satellite, as well as errors in issuing speed impulses in magnitude and direction. Trajectory corrections with one and two correction impulses are considered. Results of analysis are presented. Conclusions are drawn about the practical application of such trajectories.
In this paper, we explore the application of Kerr/CFT correspondence to the accelerating Kerr–Taub–NUT spacetime. We demonstrate that the correspondence can be maintained if the near-horizon angular coordinate is appropriately rescaled. This rescaling allows the Cardy formula to accurately reproduce the extremal Bekenstein–Hawking entropy, a departure from the typical direct recovery of extremal Bekenstein–Hawking temperature in Kerr/CFT literature. This discrepancy is attributed to the presence of multiple sources of conic singularity in the spacetime, specifically the acceleration and NUT parameters. To support the Kerr/CFT holography, we investigate the hidden conformal symmetry in the near-horizon region of the extremal black hole geometry. Our findings confirm that the angular coordinate rescaling does not introduce inconsistencies within the Kerr/CFT framework, as evidenced by the preserved hidden conformal symmetry and consistent entropy matching calculations in the near-horizon geometry of the extremal accelerating Kerr–Taub–NUT black hole.
We consider the bending of light around a compact astrophysical object with both the electric field and the magnetic field in Einstein–Born–Infeld theory. From the null geodesic of a light ray passing a massive object with electric charge and magnetic dipole, the effective metric was obtained from the light cone condition reflecting the nonlinear electromagnetic effects. We found the asymptotic form of the effective metric up to the first order in gravitational constantGand Born–Infeld parameter\(1/\beta ^2\)on the equatorial plane. Then we compute the bending angle of light from the geodesic equation. The result includes particular cases where only one type of field is present taking the appropriate limits.
We examine the accretion process in a thin disk surrounding a supermassive black hole within the framework of Einstein–Maxwell-scalar (EMS) gravity. Our investigation aims to elucidate how variations in model parameters affect different physical properties of the disk. When keeping EMS parameters\(\beta \)andqconstant, we observe a reduction in radiation flux and temperature as\(\alpha \)increases. However, the luminosity and radiative efficiency exhibit relatively minor variation. Conversely, under fixed\(\alpha \)andq, an escalation in\(\beta \)leads to heightened levels of radiation flux, temperature, luminosity, and radiative efficiency. These results underscore the diverse influences of model parameters on observable metrics, providing valuable insights for the astronomical study of distinct black holes.
We investigate the inclusive production of fully charmed tetraquarks,\(T_{4c}(0^{++})\)or\(T_{4c}(2^{++})\)radial excitations, in high-energy proton collisions. We build our study upon the collinear fragmentation of a single parton in a variable-flavor number scheme, suited to describe the tetraquark formation mechanism from moderate to large transverse-momentum regimes. To this extent, we derive a novel set of DGLAP-evolving collinear fragmentation functions, namedTQ4Q1.0determinations. They encode initial-scale inputs corresponding to both gluon and heavy-quark fragmentation channels, defined within the context of quark-potential and spin-physics inspired models, respectively. We work within the NLL/\(\hbox {NLO}^+\)hybrid factorization and make use of theJETHADnumeric interface along with thesymJETHADsymbolic calculation plugin. With these tools, we provide predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to\(T_{4c}\)plus jet emissions at center-of-mass energies ranging from 14 TeV at the LHC to the 100 TeV nominal energy of the FCC.
We compute the rate of change of mass and angular momentum of a black hole, namely tidal heating, in an eccentric orbit. The change is caused due to the tidal field of the orbiting companion. We compute the result for both the spinning and non-spinning black holes in the leading order of the mean motion, namely\(\xi \). We demonstrate that the rates get enhanced significantly for nonzero eccentricity. Since eccentricity in a binary evolves with time we also express the results in terms of an initial eccentricity and azimuthal frequency\(\xi _{\phi }\). In the process, we developed a prescription that can be used to compute all physical quantities in a series expansion of initial eccentricity,\(e_0\). These results are computed taking account of the spin of the binary components. The prescription can be used to compute very high-order corrections of initial eccentricity. We use it to find the contribution to eccentricity up to\({\mathcal {O}}(e_0^5)\)in the spinning binary. Using the computed expression of eccentricity, we derived the rate of change of mass and angular momentum of a black hole, both rotating and non-rotating, in terms of initial eccentricity and azimuthal frequency up to\({\mathcal {O}}(e_0^6)\). With the computed fluxes we also compute for the first time the leading order dephasing in both cases analytically up to\({\mathcal {O}}(e_0^6)\)and study its impact. We argue that for high signal-to-noise ratio sources, these contributions require inclusion in the waveform modeling.
Both the Barrow and Tsallis\(\delta \)entropies are one-parameter generalizations of the black-hole entropy, with the same microcanonical functional form. The ensuing deformation is quantified by a dimensionless parameter\(\Delta \), which in the case of Barrow entropy represents the anomalous dimension caused by quantum fluctuations over the horizon surface, while in Tsallis’ case, it describes the deviation of the holographic scaling from extensivity. Here, we utilize the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture with the Barrow–Tsallis entropy to investigate the implications of the related modified Friedmann equations on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves. We show that, with the experimental sensitivity of the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, such as the Big Bang Observer, it will be possible to discriminate deviations from the\(\Lambda \)CDM model up to\(\Delta \lesssim \mathcal {O}(10^{-3})\). In this limit, Barrow–Tsallis entropy reduces to a logarithmic correction to holographic scaling, which is nearly universally predicted by both entanglement entropy calculations in the UV regime and by several candidate theories of quantum gravity. Hence, our considerations and results are expected to have general validity in the quantum gravity framework.
This study explores the impact of introducing particle and future event horizon as infrared (IR) cutoff on (m,n)-type entropy corrected versions of pilgrim dark energy. We investigate (m,n)-type power-law entropy corrected pilgrim dark energy in a flat fractal platform by considering a non-interacting scenario with cold dark matter. Then, our focus shifts to (m,n)-type logarithmic entropy corrected pilgrim dark energy. We derive the evolution of some relevant cosmological parameters and cosmological planes. Finally, we constrain the model parameters using\(H(z)+\)BAO combined observational data from the DA and BAO methods. For statistical analysis, we apply the\(\chi ^2\)-minimization technique (equivalent to the maximum likelihood method) to estimate the best-fit value of the model parameters. We incorporate public Cosmo Hammer (EMCEE) Python package code to perform the MCMC method. Finally, we display the plot of cosmological parameters and cosmological plane and analyze the triangular contour plot by using the optimal values of the model parameters.
Recently, a new generalized family of infinite-dimensional\( \widetilde{W} \)algebras, each associated with a particular element of a commutative subalgebra of the\( W_{1+\infty } \)algebra, was described. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the aforementioned association, accompanied by the requisite proofs and illustrative examples. This approach allows a derivation of Ward identities for selected WLZZ matrix models and the expansion of corresponding\( W \)-operators in terms of an infinite set of variables\( p_k \).
The first measurement of the multiplicity dependence of intra-jet properties of leading charged-particle jets in proton–proton (pp) collisions is reported. The mean charged-particle multiplicity and jet fragmentation distributions are measured in minimum-bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions at center-of-mass energy\(\sqrt{s}\)= 13 TeV using the ALICE detector. Jets are reconstructed from charged particles produced in the midrapidity region (\(|\eta | < 0.9\)) using the sequential recombination anti-\(k_{\textrm{T}}\)algorithm with jet resolution parametersR= 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 for the transverse momentum (\(p_\textrm{T}\)) interval 5–110 GeV/c. The high-multiplicity events are selected by the forward V0 scintillator detectors. The mean charged-particle multiplicity inside the leading jet cone rises monotonically with increasing jet\(p_\textrm{T}\)in qualitative agreement with previous measurements at lower energies. The distributions of jet fragmentation function variables\(z^{\textrm{ch}}\)and\(\xi ^{\textrm{ch}}\)are measured for different jet-\(p_\textrm{T}\)intervals. Jet-\(p_\textrm{T}\)independent fragmentation of leading jets is observed for wider jets except at high- and low-\(z^{\textrm{ch}}\)values. The observed “hump-backed plateau” structure in the\(\xi ^{\textrm{ch}}\)distribution indicates suppression of low-\(p_\textrm{T}\)particles. In high-multiplicity events, an enhancement of the fragmentation probability of low-\(z^{\textrm{ch}}\)particles accompanied by a suppression of high-\(z^{\textrm{ch}}\)particles is observed compared to minimum-bias events. This behavior becomes more prominent for low-\(p_\textrm{T}\)jets with larger jet radius. The results are compared with predictions of QCD-inspired event generators, PYTHIA 8 with Monash 2013 tune and EPOS LHC. It is found that PYTHIA 8 qualitatively reproduces the jet modification in high-multiplicity events except at high jet\(p_\textrm{T}\). These measurements provide important constraints to models of jet fragmentation.
The concepts of radiative and adiabatic equilibria, introduced by Karl Schwarzschild in his seminal paperUeber das Gleichgewicht der Sonnenatmosphärepublished in January 1906, are the founding blocks of the theory of radiative transfer, stellar structure, and solar physics. Careful reading of the paper and its later English translation reveals small formal inaccuracies and ambiguities but with no consequences whatsoever for the final outcomes and conclusions. This paper offers their adjustments with respective derivations using contemporary formalism and sets Schwarzschild’s paper in context with a historical and modern perspective. Particular attention is paid to Schwarzschild’s largely forgotten limb-darkening formula for adiabatic equilibrium. The paper also reproduces Schwarzschild’s radiative equilibrium protomodel of the Sun’s atmosphere in graphical form and compares it with modern models presented in some of the most cited papers in stellar and solar physics.
The Moon’s farside South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin is the largest and oldest visible impact basin in the inner Solar System. Determining the timing of this catastrophic event is key to understanding the onset of the lunar basin-forming epoch, with implications for understanding the impact bombardment history of the inner Solar System. Despite this, the formation age of the SPA basin remains poorly constrained. Here we show that the chemical composition of the lunar meteorite Northwest Africa 2995 is in good agreement with lithologies exposed within the southern region of the SPA basin. Radiometric dating of a range of mineral and rock components in Northwest Africa 2995 yielded consistent dates of ~4.32–4.33 billion years old. We interpret these dates as the age of SPA basin formation, inferring that this event occurred ~120 million years before the formation of the main cluster of lunar impact basins between ~4.2 Ga and 3.8 Ga. This weakens support for a narrow period of lunar late heavy impact bombardment and also implies that the earliest formed impact basins on the Moon (that is, >4.33–4.5 Ga old) were erased either by the SPA impact itself when its formation caused massive resurfacing of the lunar surface or through other geological processes.
In this study we demonstrate the application of the maximum entropy method (MEM) to determine the valence quark distribution of exotic hadrons. Our investigation yields three key findings. Firstly, we observe a significant shift towards smaller Bjorken scalexin the peak position of the valence quark distribution for hadrons with an increasing number of valence quarks, consistent with previous results by Kawamura and Kumano. Secondly, assuming that the\(Z_c(3900)\)initially consists of four valence quarks, we employ MEM to determine its initial valence quark distribution, estimating a radius of\(r_c=1.276\)fm at an extremely low resolution scale\(Q^2\). Furthermore, we identify a notable discrepancy between our computed charge form factor\(G_c(q)\)at leading order and the outcomes of hadron molecular state calculations. We propose that this form factor can be extracted from the QCD counting rule cross-section, which is grounded in generalized distribution amplitudes (GDA) linked to the multi-quark states.
This article examines the cosmic evolution in the framework of symmetric teleparallel theory, characterized by the function of non-metricity scalar\((\mathcal {Q})\). We use the e-folding number and reconstruction method with a suitable parametrization of the scale factor to obtain the functional form of symmetric teleparallel theory. Using this reconstructed model, we examine the behavior of different cosmographic parameters to demonstrate the bouncing scenarios of the cosmos by considering the contraction and expansion phases of cosmos before and after the bouncing point, respectively. It is found that the null energy condition is violated which shows that the singularity issue can be resolved in this extended theoretical framework. Moreover, we observe that the acceleration occurs near the bouncing point and the reconstructed model aligns with the current cosmic expansion. Finally, we check the validity of second law of thermodynamics in the bouncing framework of our model.
We consider a semi-classical approximation to the dynamics of a point particle in a noncommutative space. In this approximation, the noncommutativity of space coordinates is described by a Poisson bracket. For linear Poisson brackets, the corresponding phase space is given by the cotangent bundle of a Lie group, with the Lie group playing the role of a curved momentum space. We show that the curvature of the momentum space may lead to rather unexpected physical phenomena such as an upper bound on the velocity of a free nonrelativistic particle, bounded motion for repulsive central force, and no-fall-into-the-centre for attractive Coulomb potential. We also consider a superintegrable Hamiltonian for the Kepler problem in 3-space with\(\mathfrak {su}(2)\)noncommutativity. The leading correction to the equations of motion due to noncommutativity is shown to be described by an effective monopole potential.
We study pseudoscalar\(\pi \),Kand\(\eta \)meson properties, such as masses and couplings, in dense matter at zero temperature. We use a recently proposed phenomenological quark model, known as the PNJL0, which takes into account the confinement/deconfinement phase transition by means of the traced Polyakov loop (\(\varPhi \)) which serves as an order parameter at zero temperature. We consider two different scenarios, namely, symmetric quark matter with equal chemical potentials for all the flavors, and the beta equilibrated matter. In the latter case the hadron-quark phase transition is implemented by a two model approach. For the hadron side we use a relativistic mean-field model with density dependent couplings. We show that\(\varPhi \)induces abrupt changes in the mesons properties with gap sizes regulated by the phenomenological gluonic sector of the model.
AbstractBased on the successful landings of landing modules (LM) on the surface and the introduction of aerostat probes (AP) into the air, the feasibility of exploring Venus by an AP drifting in the cloud layer of its atmosphere using short-term descents and landings on its surface has been substantiated. Mathematical modeling was performed to confirm the feasibility of short-term AP drops with a scientific package (SP) in a thermostatted compartment for sampling soil, aerosols and gases and remote sensing (RS) in various regions remote from each other near the surface of the planet Venus for their analysis during a long drift at the height of the cloud layer. Using the example of individual SP devices for geochemical and geophysical studies of Venusian rocks, the scenario and capabilities of AP are shown, which significantly expand both the range of scientific tasks to be solved and the capabilities of the scientific equipment itself.
AbstractThe paper describes the improvements made by the authors to the previously published Numerical Model of the Motion of Artificial Lunar Satellites (ALS). The results of a study of the dynamics of cislunar objects obtained by numerical modeling are presented. It is shown that the short lifespan of low-flying objects in orbits, revealed by a number of authors, is explained solely by the influence of the complex gravitational field of the Moon, primarily the radial component of the force acting on the satellites. The features of the influence of light pressure (LP) on cislunar objects are considered. It is shown that LP expands the range of action of apsidal-nodal resonances that arise in the movement of cislunar objects.
AbstractWhen passing through the Earth’s atmosphere, cosmic bodies are subjected to significant loads due to the impact of high-speed gas flow on their surface. Under the influence of aerodynamic forces and strong heat flows, these bodies are destroyed. The mechanisms of destruction depend on their composition, structure, speed, size and strength. Artificial space bodies move in the atmosphere, generally maintaining their orientation in space, and reach the surface, maintaining integrity due to their high strength. As a result of surface destruction of the frontal part of these bodies, destruction products enter the plasma layer surrounding them when moving in the atmosphere. The design features of the Soyuz descent vehicle made it possible to study the dust component of the plasma layer from the deposits deposited on the porthole. Data on particles detected on the surface of the spacecraft are analyzed, and the results of a statistical analysis of the resulting particle size distribution are presented. It is shown that the distribution curve is well described by a power law.
AbstractA method for determining the lines of variation (LOV) in the initial confidence region under strong nonlinearity in the orbit improvement problem is developed, based on finding the maximum modulus of the normal vector to the level surfaces of the objective function using the least-squares method. The method was tested for three asteroids using their observations on a short arc of the orbit, namely, the points of two variation lines corresponding to the directions of the greatest deformation of the initial confidence region were determined. Approximation of variation lines was performed using third-degree polynomials. Using the obtained approximations, new variables were introduced in which the initial confidence region is almost ellipsoidal, i.e., nonlinearity is nearly absent. The modeling of the initial probability dispersion of trajectories is performed in the space of new variables. The resulting dispersion can be further used to identify collision orbits and estimate the probability of asteroid collisions with Earth.
In the present work, we study the initial moments of a homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological model, considering Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) as the gravitational theory. The matter content of the model is a radiation perfect fluid. In order to study the initial moments of the universe in the present model, we consider quantum cosmology. More precisely the quantum mechanical tunneling mechanism. In that mechanism, the universe appears after the wavefunction associated to that universe tunnels through a potential barrier. We started studying the classical model. We draw the phase portrait of the model and identify qualitatively all types of dynamical behaviors associated to it. Then, we write the Hamiltonian of the model and apply the Dirac quantization procedure to quantize a constrained theory. We find the appropriate Wheeler-DeWitt equation and solve it using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. Using the WKB solution, to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, we compute the tunneling probabilities for the birth of that universe (\(TP_{WKB}\)). Since the WKB wavefunction depends on the radiation energy (E) and the free parameters coming from the HL theory (\(g_c\),\(g_r\),\(g_s\),\(g_\Lambda \)), we compute the behavior of\(TP_{WKB}\)as a function ofEand all the HL’s parameters\(g_c\),\(g_r\),\(g_s\),\(g_\Lambda \). As a new result, due to the HL theory, we notice that, in the present model, the universe cannot tunnel through the barrier close to the origin. It happens because that tunneling probability is nil. Therefore, here, the universe cannot starts from a zero size and is free from the big bang singularity.
Bianchi cosmologies are “natural” anisotropic extensions of the Friedmann universes and they have long been used to investigate the cosmological implications of anisotropy. The latter introduces new ingredients to the standard scenarios, although there are physical processes and effects that maintain their basic Friedmann features when extended to Bianchi universes. Here, we assume a perturbed Bianchi model and look into the implications of the observers’ peculiar flow for their measurement and their interpretation of the deceleration parameter. Our motivation is twofold. To begin with, relative motions have long been known to deceive the observers by “contaminating” the observations, which also still suffer from sample limitations that cloud the statistical significance of the findings. Further motivation comes from claims that observers in bulk flows that expand slightly slower than their surroundings can have the illusion of cosmic acceleration in a universe that is actually decelerating. The claim was originally based on studies of a perturbed tilted Einstein–de Sitter model, but persisted when the background cosmology was replaced by any of the three Friedmann universes. This raised the possibility that the peculiar-motion effect on the deceleration parameter may be generic and largely independent of the host spacetime. Here, we investigate this possibility by extending the earlier studies to perturbed Bianchi models. We find that the Friedmann picture remains unchanged, unless the Bianchi background has unrealistically high anisotropy. The bulk-flow observers can still be misled to the illusion of accelerated expansion by their own peculiar motion.
In this paper, we compute departures in the black hole thermodynamics induced by either geometric or topological corrections to general relativity. Specifically, we analyze the spherically symmetric spacetime solutions of two modified gravity scenarios with Lagrangians\(\mathcal {L}\sim R^{1+\epsilon }\)and\(\mathcal {L}\sim R+\epsilon \, \mathcal {G}^2\), where\(\mathcal {G}\)is the Euler density in four dimensions, while\( 0<\epsilon \ll 1\)measures the perturbation around the Hilbert–Einstein action. Accordingly, we find the expressions of the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy by the Penrose formula, and the black hole temperature and horizon of the obtained solutions. We then investigate the heat capacities in terms of the free parameters of the theories under study. In doing so, we show that healing the problem of negative heat capacities can be possible under particular choices of the free constants, albeit with limitations on the masses allowed for the black hole solutions.
Using proton–proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\(140\hbox { fb}^{-1}\)collected by the CMS experiment at\(\sqrt{s}= 13\,\text {Te}\hspace{-.08em}\text {V} \), the\({{{\Lambda }} _{\text {b}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\text {J}/\uppsi }} {{{\Xi }} ^{{-}}} {{\text {K}} ^{{+}}} \)decay is observed for the first time, with a statistical significance exceeding 5 standard deviations. The relative branching fraction, with respect to the\({{{\Lambda }} _{\text {b}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{{\uppsi }} ({2\textrm{S}})} {{\Lambda }} \)decay, is measured to be\(\mathcal {B}({{{\Lambda }} _{\text {b}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{\text {J}/\uppsi }} {{{\Xi }} ^{{-}}} {{\text {K}} ^{{+}}} )/\mathcal {B}({{{\Lambda }} _{\text {b}}^{{0}}} \rightarrow {{{\uppsi }} ({2\textrm{S}})} {{\Lambda }} ) = [3.38\pm 1.02\pm 0.61\pm 0.03]\%\), where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is related to the uncertainties in\(\mathcal {B}({{{\uppsi }} ({2\textrm{S}})} \rightarrow {{\text {J}/\uppsi }} {{{\uppi }} ^{{+}}} {{{\uppi }} ^{{-}}} )\)and\(\mathcal {B}({{{\Xi }} ^{{-}}} \rightarrow {{\Lambda }} {{{\uppi }} ^{{-}}} )\).
We propose an interpretation for the adjoint representation of theSO(32) group to classify the scalars of a generic Supersymmetric Standard Model having just three generations of particles, via a flavour groupSU(5). We show that this same interpretation arises from a simple postulate of self-consistence of composites for these scalars. The model looks only for colour and electric charge, and it pays the cost of an additional chiral\(+4/3\)quark per generation.
AbstractThe degassing of basic silicate minerals (olivines, pyroxenes, plagioclases) that make up mantle rocks similar in chemical composition to lunar mare basalts has been studied. A setup specially designed for these tasks was used, previously used in the study of chondrite degassing. The results of experimental studies on stepwise heating (without accumulation) with determination of the composition of released gases using gas chromatography methods in the temperature range from 200 to 1000°C are presented. The composition of the released gases was compared with the fugacity of oxygen in olivines. Raman and IR spectra of both the original minerals and minerals after isothermal annealing at various temperatures were obtained. Based on them, the course of thermal transformation of the crystalline structure of minerals was traced and estimates of their stability were obtained. The composition of silicate minerals was compared with samples of lunar soil delivered by the Chinese space missionChang’e-5.
AbstractIn the period December 12, 2022, to February 28, 2023, we performed a series ofUBVRIobservations of 65 asteroids, including 50 primitive-type objects, which could be observed near perihelion at that time, and calculated their approximated reflectance spectra. The observations were aimed at searching for spectral signs of sublimation-driven dust activity in the asteroids and formation of a transient dust exosphere, which are caused by the presence of Н2О ice in their interior and the highest subsolar temperature. Based on the analysis of the accuracy and shape of approximated reflectance spectra of the primitive-type asteroids, a set of which was conventionally restricted by the geometric albedo value not exceeding 0.10, we found sublimation-driven dust activity in asteroids 164 Eva, 360 Carlova, and 750 Oskar by distinct short-term variations in the reflectance of these asteroids in theUband. During one of the nights, similar spectral changes and sublimation-driven dust activity related to them were detected in asteroid 629 Bernardina; the geometric albedo of this asteroid is somewhat higher (0.14 or 0.19), which may be indicative of a heterogeneous composition of its material and, apparently, a local outcropping of water ice on its surface. Moreover, in three asteroids of a high-temperature type, 757 Portlandia, 1121 Natascha, and 1687 Glarona, noticeable variations were detected in the entire spectral range; they may be connected with ejection of submicron dust particles from the surface by some other mechanisms. To substantiate and interpret the results of observations, we numerically modeled the reflectance spectra of conditional asteroids of taxonomic types C and S (with low- and high-temperature mineralogy, respectively), which are enveloped by an optically thin dust exosphere containing aggregate or homogeneous submicron particles of different composition. On the basis of this modeling, we introduce a quantitative criterion to identify a weak sublimation-driven dust activity in primitive-type asteroids in the visible range.
AbstractThe paper propose the method for solving the Euler–Lambert problem proposed by V.A. Egorov and based on the works by D.E. Okhotsimsky, devoted to the analysis of a set of flight trajectories between two given points in the central Newtonian field. When considering the Euler–Lambert problem as the inverse problem of ballistics (dynamics), we have succeeded in developing a new effective method for determining the orbit corresponding to a given flight time. It is logical to name this approach the Okhotsimsky–Egorov method. In the considered approach, the parameter of the set of flights is the initial flight-path angle. The advantages of the proposed method are the limited and understandable structure of the domain of definition of solutions, the simplicity and clarity of the algorithm, and the clear dependence of the solution on the initial velocity. It enables a qualitative analysis of flight trajectories and the construction of effective numerical methods. To solve the Euler–Lambert problem Halley’s numerical method was used. A computational complexity analysis of considered algorithm was carried out and demonstrated its high efficiency.
AbstractThe aim of this paper is to investigate the motion properties of the infinitesimal body under the effects of gravitational forces, the quantum correction, variable mass, modified Newtonian force, interaction between bodies, triaxial parameters, Coriolis and centrifugal forces in the restricted three-body configuration. Using Jeans law, Meshcherskii space-time transformations and the above perturbations, we evaluate the equations of motion and quasi-Jacobian integral. And then, we numerically illustrate the locations of equilibrium points, regions of motion, Poincare surfaces of section, basins of attraction, periodic orbits and stability of the equilibrium points.
We construct new supersymmetric Janus solutions from four-dimensional\(N=3\)gauged supergravity coupled to eight vector multiplets with\(SO(3)\times SU(3)\)gauge group. This gauged supergravity admits a supersymmetric\(N=3\)\(AdS_4\)vacuum with the full\(SO(3)\times SU(3)\)symmetry unbroken and a family of supersymmetric\(N=1,2,3\)and non-supersymmetric\(AdS_4\)vacua with different residual symmetries. These are expected to be dual to supersymmetric Chern–Simons–Matter (CSM) theories in three dimensions via the AdS/CFT correspondence. By considering a truncation to three complex scalar fields, we find a number of Janus solutions preserving\(N=1\)supersymmetry that describes conformal interfaces within\(N=3\)CSM theories with\(SO(3)\times SU(3)\)and\(SU(2)_{\text {diag}}\times U(1)\)symmetries.
In this work, we have formulated a new class of traversable wormhole metrics. Initially, we have considered a wormhole metric in which the temporal component is an exponential function ofrbut the spatial components of the metrics are fixed. Following that, we have again constructed a generalized wormhole metric in which the spatial component is an exponential function ofr, but the temporal component is fixed. Finally, we have considered the generalized wormhole metric in which both the temporal and spatial components are generalized exponential functions ofr. We have also studied some of their properties including throat radius, stability, and energy conditions, examined singularity, the metric in curvature coordinates, effective refractive index, innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and photon sphere, Regge–Wheeler potential and their quasinormal modes, gravitational entropy, and determined the curvature tensor. The radius of the throat is found to be consistent with the properties of wormholes and does not contain any types of singularities. Most interestingly, we find that their throat radius is the same for the same spatial component and the same range of values ofm. In addition to these, they also violate the Null Energy Condition (NEC) near the throat. These newly constructed metrics form a new class of traversable wormholes.
The observation of the electroweak production of aWboson and a photon in association with two jets, usingppcollision data at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre of mass energy of\(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV, is reported. The data were recorded by the ATLAS experiment from 2015 to 2018 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb\(^{-1}\). This process is sensitive to the quartic gauge boson couplings via the vector boson scattering mechanism and provides a stringent test of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. Events are selected if they contain one electron or muon, missing transverse momentum, at least one photon, and two jets. Multivariate techniques are used to distinguish the electroweak\(W\gamma jj\)process from irreducible background processes. The observed significance of the electroweak\(W\gamma jj\)process is well above six standard deviations, compared to an expected significance of 6.3 standard deviations. Fiducial and differential cross sections are measured in a fiducial phase space close to the detector acceptance, which are in reasonable agreement with leading order Standard Model predictions fromMadGraph5+Pythia8andSherpa. The results are used to constrain new physics effects in the context of an effective field theory.
In this work, we investigated an inhomogeneous spherically symmetric star consisting of dust fluid and dark energy components. We obtained similarity solutions for the energy density of the inhomogeneous dust fluid\(\rho (t,r)\), dark energy\(\rho _{DE}(t,r)\), and the mass function inside the starm(t,r). The symmetries of Einstein field equations for this model are derived using the symmetry group analysis method, where the Einstein field equations have been reduced into nonlinear ordinary differential equations (NODEs). Some interesting explicit analytical solutions are obtained for the reduced NODEs. Consequently, a new class of similarity solutions has been obtained for the energy density of the inhomogeneous dust fluid and dark energy as functions of coordinatestandr. These solutions are obtained when the star is composed of both dust fluid and dark energy components, dark energy components only, and dust fluid only. When the star is composed of dust fluid only, we discussed the possibility of black hole formation by assuming that the collapsing star is not initially trapped. Graphical representations of some solutions are given and discussed in the last section.
We analyze the orbits of a unit mass body in a background Reissner–Nordstr\(\ddot{\textrm{o}}\)m (RN) black hole in\(d\)\(=\)\((3+1)\)from the perspectives of Geometric Torsion (GT) modified gravity theory in\((4+1)\)dimensional bulk. A 4-form flux in bulk GT theory in\(d\)\(=\)\((4+1)\)has been shown to ensure a mass dipole correction to the\((3+1)\)dimensional gravity theory by Gupta, Kar and Rang recently. We argue that the dipole correction contributes topologically to the known exact geometries in General Theory of Relativity (GTR). Furthermore, the topological correction has been identified with non-Newtonian potential underlying a\(B_2 \wedge F_2\)coupling term to Einstein–Hilbert action. The winding numbers ensured by theBFcoupling to\(d=(3+1)\)action in the framework presumably provide a clue towards a tunneling instanton in theory.
We investigate the meson-baryon interaction in coupled channels with the quantum numbers of the pentaquarks\(P_{bss}\)and\(P_{bsss}\). The interaction is derived from an extension of the local hidden gauge approach to the heavy quark sector, which has demonstrated accurate results compared to experiments involving\(\Omega _{b}\),\(\Xi _{b}\)states, and pentaquarks\(P_{c}\)and\(P_{cs}\). In our study, we identify several molecular states with small decay widths within the chosen set of coupled channels. The spin-parity (\(J^P\)) of these states is as follows:\(J^P={\frac{1}{2}}^-\)for pseudoscalar-baryon (\({\frac{1}{2}}^+\)) coupled channels,\(J^P={\frac{3}{2}}^-\)for pseudoscalar-baryon (\({\frac{3}{2}}^+\)) coupled channels,\(J^P={\frac{1}{2}}^-\)and\({\frac{3}{2}}^-\)for vector-baryon (\({\frac{1}{2}}^+\)) coupled channels, and\(J^P={\frac{1}{2}}^-\),\({\frac{3}{2}}^-\),\({\frac{5}{2}}^-\)for vector-baryon (\({\frac{3}{2}}^+\)) coupled channels. We search for the poles of these states and evaluate their couplings to the different channels.
We present a study on quantum gravity effects on the shadow of a rotating black hole (BH) obtained in the setting of the asymptotically safe gravity. The rotating metric, which results from a static regular one recently presented in the literature, is generated by using the generalized Newman-Janis algorithm. The novelty of the static regular metric lies in the fact that it is the outcome of an effective Lagrangian which describes dust whose spherically symmetric collapse is non-singular as a consequence of the antiscreening character of gravity at small distances. The effective Lagrangian includes a multiplicative coupling, denoted as\(\chi \), with the Lagrangian of the collapsing fluid. The resulting exterior metric for large radii depends on a free parameter\(\xi \)which captures the quantum gravity effects. The form of the coupling\(\chi \)and its connection with the quantum parameter\(\xi \)are determined by the running of the Newton couplingG(k) along a renormalization group trajectory that stops at the ultraviolet non-gaussian fixed point of the asymptotic safety theory for quantum gravity. Varying both the spin parameter\(a_{\star }\)and the quantum parameter\(\xi \), we explore the quantum gravity effects on several astronomical observables used to describe the morphology of the shadow cast by rotating BHs. In order to obtain constraints on the parameter\(\xi \), we confront our results with the recent Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the shadows of the supermassive BHs\(\hbox {M87}^*\)and Sgr\(\hbox {A}^*\). We find that the ranges of variation of all the studied shadow observables fall entirely within the ranges determined by the EHT collaboration. We then conclude that the current astronomical data do not rule out the renormalization group improved rotating BH.
In this work, we investigate the violation of Lorentz symmetry through the Casimir effect, one of the most intriguing phenomena in modern physics. The Casimir effect, which represents a macroscopic quantum force between two neutral conducting surfaces, is widely regarded as a triumph of Quantum Field Theory. In this study, we present new results for the Casimir effect, focusing on the contribution of mass associated with fermionic quantum fields confined between two large parallel plates, in the context of Lorentz symmetry violation within the Horava–Lifshitz formalism. To calculate the Casimir energy and pressure, we impose a MIT bag boundary condition on the two plates, compatible with the higher-order derivative term in the modified Dirac equation. Our results reveal a strong influence of Lorentz violation on the Casimir effect. We observe that the Casimir energy is significantly affected, both in intensity and sign, potentially resulting in a repulsive or attractive force between the plates, depending on the critical exponent associated with the Horava–Lifshitz formalism.
A significant challenge in measurements of neutrino oscillations is reconstructing the incoming neutrino energies. While modern fully-active tracking calorimeters such as liquid argon time projection chambers in principle allow the measurement of all final state particles above some detection threshold, undetected neutrons remain a considerable source of missing energy with little to no data constraining their production rates and kinematics. We present the first demonstration of tagging neutrino-induced neutrons in liquid argon time projection chambers using secondary protons emitted from neutron-argon interactions in the MicroBooNE detector. We describe the method developed to identify neutrino-induced neutrons and demonstrate its performance using neutrons produced in muon-neutrino charged current interactions. The method is validated using a small subset of MicroBooNE’s total dataset. The selection yields a sample with\(60\%\)of selected tracks corresponding to neutron-induced secondary protons. At this purity, the integrated efficiency is 8.4% for neutrons that produce a detectable proton.
We propose a novel approach for discovering a light dark photon in the forward experiments at the LHC, including the SND@LHC and the FASER experiments. Assuming the dark photon is lighter than twice the electron mass and feebly interacts with ordinary matter, it is long-lived enough to pass through 100 m of rock in front of the forward experiments and also through the detector targets. However, some portion of them could be converted into an electron-positron pair inside the detector through their interaction with the detector target, leaving an isolated electromagnetic shower as a clear new physics signature of the dark photon. With copiously produced dark photons from neutral pion decays in the forward region of the LHC, we expect to observe sizable events inside the detector. Our estimation shows that more than 10 signal events of the dark photon could be observed in the range of kinetic mixing parameter,\(6.2\times 10^{-5} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 2\times 10^{-1}\)and\(3\times 10^{-5} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 2\times 10^{-1}\)for dark photon mass\(m_{A^\prime } \lesssim \)1 MeV with integrated luminosities of 150 fb\(^{-1}\)and 3 ab\(^{-1}\), respectively.
A new release of the Monte Carlo event generatorHerwig(version 7.3) has been launched. This iteration encompasses several enhancements over its predecessor, version 7.2. Noteworthy upgrades include: the implementation of a process-independent electroweak angular-ordered parton shower integrated with QCD and QED radiation; a new recoil scheme for initial-state radiation improving the behaviour of the angular-ordered parton shower; the incorporation of the heavy quark effective theory to refine the hadronization and decay of excited heavy mesons and heavy baryons; a dynamic strategy to regulate the kinematic threshold of cluster splittings within the cluster hadronization model; several improvements to the structure of the cluster hadronization model allowing for refined models; the possibility to extract event-by-event hadronization corrections in a well-defined way; the possibility of using the string model, with a dedicated tune. Additionally, a new tuning of the parton shower and hadronization parameters has been executed. This article discusses the novel features introduced in version 7.3.0.
Classical General Relativity is a dynamical theory of spacetime metrics of Lorentzian signature. In particular the classical metric field is nowhere degenerate in spacetime. In its initial value formulation with respect to a Cauchy surface the induced metric is of Euclidian signature and nowhere degenerate on it. It is only under this assumption of non-degeneracy of the induced metric that one can derive the hypersurface deformation algebra between the initial value constraints which is absolutely transparent from the fact that theinverseof the induced metric is needed to close the algebra. This statement is independent of the density weight that one may want to equip the spatial metric with. Accordingly, the very definition of a non-anomalous representation of the hypersurface deformation algebra in quantum gravity has to address the issue of non-degeneracy of the induced metric that is needed in the classical theory. In the Hilbert space representation employed in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) most emphasis has been laid to define an inverse metric operator on the dense domain of spin network states although they represent induced quantum geometries which are degenerate almost everywhere. It is no surprise that demonstration of closure of the constraint algebra on this domain meets difficulties because it is a sector of the quantum theory which is classically forbidden and which lies outside the domain of definition of the classical hypersurface deformation algebra. Various suggestions for addressing the issue such as non-standard operator topologies, dual spaces (habitats) and density weights have been proposed to address this issue with respect to the quantum dynamics of LQG. In this article we summarise these developments and argue that insisting on a dense domain of non-degenerate states within the LQG representation may provide a natural resolution of the issue thereby possibly avoiding the above mentioned non-standard constructions.
We give a general description of the system evolution under the interaction between qubit and quantum field theory up to the second order perturbation, which is also referred to as the simplified model of light-matter interaction. The results are classified into rotating and counter-rotating wave terms, the former corresponding to stimulated absorption and emission, and the latter to Unruh and anti-Unruh effects. We obtain not only the reduced density matrix of the qubit, but also the backreaction obtained by quantum field theory as the environment. The result shows that the energy variation of the quantum field theory is related to trajectory and the initial state of the qubit, the expectation values of the linear and quadratic field operators, and the temporal order product operator. When the qubit is in accelerated motion, the conventional Unruh effect causes the vacuum state to possess a “temperature”, which raises some doubts about the validity of Landauer’s principle. We prove that Landauer’s principle still holds for any state of motion.
A detailed symmetry analysis has been done for the present multi scalar-torsion gravity theory in the background of flat Friedmann Lema\(\hat{\text{ i }}\)tre Robertson Walker (FLRW) space-time. Not only the Noether symmetry from the invariance of the Lagrangian has been determined and associated conserved quantities are evaluated, but also the conformal symmetry of the physical metric (i.e., metric of the kinetic part) has been investigated to evaluate homothetic and killing vector fields. Finally, a through study of quantum cosmology both by canonical approach and by considering quantum trajectories has been presented.
Using the Bower–Liang model, we discuss how pressure anisotropies affect the microscopic and macroscopic properties of hybrid stars. We find that anisotropies affect the maximum mass, central density, and radius of the canonical stars. Anisotropies also affect the minimum neutron star mass that presents quarks in their core, as well as the total amount of quarks for the maximally massive stars. We also confront our results with standard constraints, such as the radius and the tidal parameter of the canonical star, as well as the mass and radius of the PSR J0740+6620 pulsar. We observe that moderate values for anisotropies could fulfill these constraints simultaneously. On the other hand, within more extreme degrees of anisotropies, more speculative constraints such as black widow pulsars PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-gap object in the GW190814 event can be explained as hybrid stars. We also investigate the role of anisotropies in the neutron stars’ moment of inertia.
The geodesic motion in a Lorentzian spacetime can be described by trajectories in a 3-dimensional Riemannian metric. In this article we present a generalized Jacobi metric obtained from projecting a Lorentzian metric over the directions of its Killing vectors. The resulting Riemannian metric inherits the geodesics for asymptotically flat spacetimes including the stationary and axisymmetric ones. The method allows us to find Riemannian metrics in three and two dimensions plus the radial geodesic equation when we project over three different directions. The 3-dimensional Riemannian metric reduces to the Jacobi metric when static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetimes are considered. However, it can be calculated for a larger variety of metrics in any number of dimensions. We show that the geodesics of the original spacetime metrics are inherited by the projected Riemannian metric. We calculate the Gaussian and geodesic curvatures of the resulting 2-dimensional metric, we study its near horizon and asymptotic limit. We also show that this technique can be used for studying the violation of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in the context of general relativity.
This paper is the first in a sequence of three devoted to the formulation of a theory of self-gravitating anisotropic fluids in both Newtonian and relativistic gravity. In this first paper we set the stage, place our work in the context of a vast literature on anisotropic stars in general relativity, and provide an overview of the results obtained in the remaining two papers. In the second paper we develop the Newtonian theory, inspired by a familiar example of an anisotropic fluid, the (nematic) liquid crystal, and apply the theory to the construction of Newtonian stellar models. In the third paper we port the theory to general relativity, and exploit it to obtain relativistic stellar models. In both cases, Newtonian and relativistic, the state of the fluid is described by the familiar variables of an isotropic fluid (such as mass density and velocity field), to which we adjoin a director vector, which defines a locally preferred direction within the fluid. The director field contributes to the kinetic and potential energies of the fluid, and therefore to its dynamics. Both the Newtonian and relativistic theories are defined in terms of an action functional; variation of the action gives rise to dynamical equations for the fluid and gravitational field. While each theory is formulated in complete generality, in these papers we apply them to the construction of stellar models by restricting the fluid configurations to be static and spherically symmetric. We find that the equations of anisotropic stellar structure are generically singular at the stellar surface. To avoid a singularity, we postulate the existence of a phase transition at a critical value of the mass density; the fluid is anisotropic at high densities, and goes to an isotropic phase at low densities. In the case of Newtonian stars, we find that sequences of equilibrium configurations terminate at a maximum value of the central density; beyond this maximum the density profile becomes multi-valued within the star, and the model therefore becomes unphysical. In the case of relativistic stars, this phenomenon typically occurs beyond the point at which the stellar mass achieves a maximum, and we conjecture that this point marks the onset of a dynamical instability to radial perturbations (as it does for isotropic stars). Also in the case of relativistic stars, we find that for a given equation of state and a given assignment of central density, anisotropic stellar models are always less compact than isotropic models.
The physical processes that establish the morphological evolution and the structural diversity of galaxies are key unknowns in extragalactic astrophysics. Here we report the finding of the morphologically mature galaxy JADES-GS+53.18343−27.79097, which existed within the first 700 million years of the Universe’s history. This star-forming galaxy with a stellar mass of 400 million solar masses consists of three components: a highly compact core with a half-light radius of less than 100 pc, an actively star-forming disc with a radius of about 400 pc and a star-forming clump, all of which show distinctive star-formation histories. The central stellar mass density of this galaxy is within a factor of 2 of the most massive present-day ellipticals, while being globally 1,000 times less massive. The radial profile of the specific star-formation rate is rising towards the outskirts. This evidence suggests a detection of the inside-out growth of a galaxy as a proto-bulge and a star-forming disc in the epoch of reionization.
We present the explicit form of the Regge trajectory relations for the triply heavy bottom-charm baryons, which can be applied to investigate both the\(\lambda \)-mode excited states and the\(\rho \)-mode excited states. We estimate the masses of the\(\lambda \)-excited states and the\(\rho \)-excited states. The results are in agreement with other theoretical predictions. Both the\(\lambda \)-trajectories and the\(\rho \)-trajectories are discussed. Moreover, the behaviors of the\(\lambda \)- and\(\rho \)-trajectories for various baryons are discussed. It is shown that both the\(\lambda \)-trajectories and the\(\rho \)-trajectories for baryons are concave downwards in the\((M^2,\,x)\)plane. The Regge trajectories for the light baryons are approximately linear and become concave as the masses of the light constituents are considered.
It has recently been demonstrated (Giusti in Phys Rev D that characteristic traits of Milgrom’s modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) can be replicated from an entirely distinct framework: a fractional variant of Newtonian mechanics. To further assess its validity, this proposal needs to be tested in relevant astrophysical scenarios. Here, we investigate its implications on Jeans gravitational instability and related phenomena. We examine scenarios involving classical matter confined by gravity and extend our analysis to the quantum domain, through a Schrödinger–Newton approach. We also derive a generalized Lane–Emden equation associated with fractional gravity. Through comparisons between the derived stability criteria and the observed stability of Bok globules, we establish constraints on the theory’s parameters to align with observational data.
This is the third and final entry in a sequence of papers devoted to the formulation of a theory of self-gravitating anisotropic fluids in Newtonian gravity and general relativity. In the first paper we placed our work in context and provided an overview of the results obtained in the second and third papers. In the second paper we took the necessary step of elaborating a Newtonian theory, and exploited it to build anisotropic stellar models. In this third paper we elevate the theory to general relativity, and apply it to the construction of relativistic stellar models. The relativistic theory is crafted by promoting the fluid variables to a curved spacetime, and promoting the gravitational potential to the spacetime metric. Thus, the director vector, which measures the local magnitude and direction of the anisotropy, is now a four-dimensional vector, and to keep the number of independent degrees of freedom at three, it is required to be orthogonal to the fluid’s velocity vector. The Newtonian action is then generalized in a direct and natural way, and dynamical equations for all the relevant variables are once more obtained through a variational principle. We specialize our relativistic theory of a self-gravitating anisotropic fluid to static and spherically symmetric configurations, and thus obtain models of anisotropic stars in general relativity. As in the Newtonian setting, the models feature a transition from an anisotropic phase at high density to an isotropic phase at low density. Our survey of stellar models reveals that for the same equations of state and the same central density, anisotropic stars are always less compact than isotropic stars.
This paper is the second in a sequence of three devoted to the formulation of a theory of self-gravitating anisotropic fluids in both Newtonian gravity and general relativity. In the first paper we set the stage, placed our work in context, and provided an overview of the results obtained in this paper and the next. In this second paper we develop the Newtonian theory, inspired by a real-life example of an anisotropic fluid, the (nematic) liquid crystal. We apply the theory to the construction of static and spherical stellar models. In the third paper we port the theory to general relativity, and exploit it to build relativistic stellar models. In addition to the usual fluid variables (mass density, velocity field), the Newtonian theory features a director vector field\(\varvec{c}(t,\varvec{x})\), whose length provides a local measure of the size of the anisotropy, and whose direction gives the local direction of anisotropy. The theory is defined in terms of a Lagrangian which implicates all the relevant forms of energy: kinetic energy (with contributions from the velocity field and the time derivative of the director vector), internal energy (with isotropic and anisotropic contributions), gravitational interaction energy, and gravitational-field energy. This Lagrangian is easy to motivate, and it provides an excellent starting point for a relativistic generalization in the third paper. The equations of motion for the fluid, and Poisson’s equation for the gravitational potential, follow from a variation of the action functional, given by the time integral of the Lagrangian. Because our stellar models feature a transition from an anisotropic phase at high density to an isotropic phase at low density, a substantial part of the paper is devoted to the development of a mechanics for the interface fluid, which mediates the phase transition.
It remains a mystery when our Milky Way first formed a stellar disk component that survived and maintained its disk structure from subsequent galaxy mergers. We present a study of the age-dependent structure and star formation rate of the Milky Way’s disk using high-α stars with substantial orbital angular momentum that have precise age determinations. Our results show that the radial scale length is nearly independent of age, whereas the vertical scale height experienced dramatic evolution. A disk-like geometry presents even for populations older than 13 Gyr, with the scale height-to-length ratio dropping below 0.5 for populations younger than 12.5 Gyr. We dub the oldest population that has maintained a disk geometry—apparently formed over 13 Gyr ago—PanGu. With an estimated present-day stellar mass of approximately 2 × 109M⊙, PanGu is presumed to be a major stellar component of our Galaxy in the earliest epoch. The total present-day stellar mass of the whole high-α disk is 2 × 1010M⊙, which was mostly formed during a distinct star formation rate peak of 11M⊙per year around 11 Gyr ago. A comparison with Milky Way analogues in the TNG50 simulations implies that our Galaxy has experienced an exceptionally quiescent dynamical history, even before the Gaia–Enceladus merger.
In this paper, we explore the relativistic quantum motion of spin-zero scalar charge-free particles influenced by rainbow gravity’s (RG’s) in Bonnor–Melvin magnetic space-time, a four-dimensional solution featuring a positive cosmological constant. We solve the Klein–Gordon equation in this scenario by using two sets of rainbow function: (i)\(f(\chi )=\frac{1}{(1-\beta \,\chi )}\),\(h(\chi )=1\)and (ii)\(f(\chi )=\frac{1}{(1-\beta \,\chi )}=h(\chi )\), where\(0 < \chi \left( =\frac{|E|}{E_p}\right) \le 1\)with\(E_p\)being the Planck’s energy,Eis the particle’s energy, and\(\beta \)is the rainbow parameter. Furthermore, we study the relativistic quantum oscillator through the Klein–Gordon oscillator equation in the same Bonnor–Melvin magnetic space-time under RG effects. Employing the first pair of rainbow function, we obtain an approximate eigenvalue solution of the quantum oscillator fields. Notably, we demonstrate that the relativistic energy profile of scalar and oscillator particles are influenced by the topology of the geometry and the cosmological constant which is related with the magnetic field strength lies along the symmetry axis. Additionally, we see the impact of rainbow parameter on these approximate relativistic energy profiles in both quantum systems.
SBND is the near detector of the Short-Baseline Neutrino program at Fermilab. Its location near to the Booster Neutrino Beam source and relatively large mass will allow the study of neutrino interactions on argon with unprecedented statistics. This paper describes the expected performance of the SBND photon detection system, using a simulated sample of beam neutrinos and cosmogenic particles. Its design is a dual readout concept combining a system of 120 photomultiplier tubes, used for triggering, with a system of 192 X-ARAPUCA devices, located behind the anode wire planes. Furthermore, covering the cathode plane with highly-reflective panels coated with a wavelength-shifting compound recovers part of the light emitted towards the cathode, where no optical detectors exist. We show how this new design provides a high light yield and a more uniform detection efficiency, an excellent timing resolution and an independent 3D-position reconstruction using only the scintillation light. Finally, the whole reconstruction chain is applied to recover the temporal structure of the beam spill, which is resolved with a resolution on the order of nanoseconds.
We construct the (\(\beta \)-deformed) higher order total derivative operators and analyze their remarkable properties. In terms of these operators, we derive the higher order constraints for the (\(\beta \)-deformed) Hermitian matrix models. We prove that these (\(\beta \)-deformed) higher order constraints are reducible to the Virasoro constraints. Meanwhile, the Itoyama–Matsuo conjecture for the constraints of the Hermitian matrix model is proved. We also find that through rescaling variable transformations, two sets of the constraint operators become theW-operators ofW-representations for the (\(\beta \)-deformed) partition function hierarchies in the literature.
The initial spin periods of newborn magnetars are strongly associated with the origin of their strong magnetic fields, both of which can affect the electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves (GWs) emitted at their birth. Combining the upper limit\(E_{\textrm{SNR}}\lesssim 10^{51}\)erg on the explosion energies of the supernova (SN) remnants around slowly-spinning magnetars with a detailed investigation on the evolution of newborn magnetars, we set constraints on the initial spin periods of magnetars born in weak SN explosions. Depending on the conversion efficiency\(\eta \)of the electromagnetic energy of these newborn magnetars into the kinetic energy of SN ejecta, the minimum initial spin periods of these newborn magnetars are\(P_{\textrm{i, min}}\simeq 5\)–6 ms for an ideal efficiency\(\eta =1\),\(P_{\textrm{i, min}}\simeq 3\)–4 ms for a possible efficiency\(\eta =0.4\), and\(P_{\textrm{i, min}}\simeq 1\)–2 ms for a relatively low efficiency\(\eta =0.1\). Based on these constraints and adopting reasonable values for the physical parameters of the newborn magnetars, we find that their GW radiation at\(\nu _{\textrm{e,1}}=\nu \)may be undetectable by the Einstein Telescope (ET) since the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (\(\mathrm{S/N}\)) is only 2.41 even the sources are located at a very close distance of 5 Mpc, where\(\nu \)are the spin frequencies of the magnetars. At such a distance, the GWs emitted at\(\nu _{\textrm{e,2}}=2\nu \)from the newborn magnetars with dipole fields\(B_{\textrm{d}}=5\times 10^{14}\)and\(10^{15}\)G may be detectable by the ET because\(\mathrm{S/N}\)are 10.01 and 19.85, respectively. However, if these newborn magnetars are located at 20 Mpc away in the Virgo supercluster, no GWs could be detected by the ET due to low\(\mathrm{S/N}\).
The gauge formalism intelepalallel gravityprovides an interesting viewpoint to describe interactions according to an anholonomic observer’s tetrad basis. Without going into assessing the complete viability of quantization in an early stage, this paper explores classical gravity within the framework of a classical-to-quantum bridge between the SU(1, 3) Yang–Mills gauge formalism and the gauge-like treatment of teleparallel gravity. Specifically, the perturbed spacetime algebra with Weitzenböck connection can be assimilated to a local complexification based on the SU(1, 3) Yang–Mills theory, what we call hypercolor or, simply, color. The formulation of the hypercolor dynamics is build by a translational gauge, as in the teleparallel gravities. In particular, this work analyses small perturbations of a metric decomposition related to the Wilson line and the Kaluza–Klein metric, but obtaining electrodynamics in four dimensions. The spacetime coordinates are now matrices that represent elements of the\(\mathfrak {su}(1,3)\)algebra. To make compatible the formulation of a colored gravity with the Lorentz force and the Maxwell equations, it is enough to define every energy potential origin as 0 in the event horizon instead of the classic zero potential at infinity. Under the colored gravity framework, standard electromagnetism can be obtained as a particular abelian case.
In this study, we demonstrate the potential of the NA64 experiment at CERN SPS to search for New Physics processes involving\(e\rightarrow \mu \)transitions after the collision of 100 GeV electrons with target nuclei. A new Dark Sector leptonic portal in which a scalar boson\(\varphi \)could be produced in the lepton-flavor-changing bremsstrahlung-like reaction,\(eN\rightarrow \mu N\varphi \), is used as benchmark process. In this work, we develop a realistic Monte Carlo simulation of the NA64 experimental setup implementing the differential and total production cross-section computed at exact tree-level and applying the Weiszäcker–Williams phase space approximation. Using this framework, we investigate the main background sources and calculate the expected sensitivity of the experiment. The results indicate that with minor setup optimization, NA64 can probe a large fraction of the available parameter space compatible with the muon\(g-2\)anomaly and the Dark Matter relic predictions in the context of a new Dark Sector leptonic portal with\(10^{11}\)EOT. This result paves the way to the exploration of lepton-flavour-changing transitions in NA64.
In this paper, we study the one-loop effective potential of a derivative four-fermion model. As a result, an exact bumblebee-like potential is radiatively generated. Afterwards, we generalize our study for a finite temperature case and explicitly demonstrate the possibility of phase transitions allowing for the restoration of the Lorentz symmetry. We also investigate the low-energy effective action, from which we obtain the usual kinetic term and the corresponding bumblebee potential.
The Yukawa coupling of fermions with a periodic bosonic background is shown to give rise to several bound states to the fermionic spectrum, with some bound states gluing together around specific energy eingenvalues as the Yukawa coupling increases. This effect induces the presence of degenerate energy states inside the fermionic gap and may be of current interest.
In this work we study, within the framework of Cowling approximation, the effect of the electric charge on the gravitational wave frequency of fluid oscillation modes of strange quark stars. For this purpose, the dense matter of the stellar fluid is described by the MIT bag model equation of state (EoS), while for the electric charge profile, we consider that the electric charge density is proportional to the energy density. We find that the gravitational wave frequencies change with the increment of electric charge; these effects are more noticeable at higher total mass values. We obtain that thef-mode is very sensitive to the change in the electric charge of the star. Furthermore, in the case of the\(p_1\)mode, the effect of the electric charge is not very significant. Our results reveal that the study of the fundamental pulsation mode of an electrically charged compact star is very important in distinguishing whether compact stars could contain electric charge. We also employ another electric charge distribution profile that follows a power law, and it is found that thef-mode change is more noticeable than the\(p_1\)-mode when the electric charge is incremented.
In this paper, we investigate certain aspects of Lee–Wick electrodynamics near a semitransparent planar mirror. Specifically, we derive the modified propagator for the Lee–Wick gauge field in the presence of the mirror and conduct a detailed analysis of the interaction energy and the interaction force that arise between the mirror and a stationary point-like charge. We demonstrate that there are several peculiarities in this interaction compared to the results obtained for Maxwell electrodynamics. Our focus is on the divergences mitigated by the Podolsky mass term.
Considering a theory space consisting of a large number of five-dimensional Dirac fermion field theories including background abelian gauge fields, we can construct a theory similar to a continuous six-dimensional theory compactified with two-dimensional manifolds with and without magnetic flux or orbifolds as extra dimensions. This method, called dimensional deconstruction, can be used to construct a model with one-dimensional discrete space, which represents general graph structures. In this paper, we propose the models with two extra dimensions, which resemble two-dimensional tori, cylinders, and rectangular regions, as continuum limits. We also try to build a model that mimics one with the two-dimensional orbifold compactification.
We study geometrically thick non-self gravitating equilibrium tori orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in swirling universes. This solution is axially symmetric and non-asymptotically flat, and its north and south hemispheres spin in opposite directions. Due to repulsive effects arising from the swirl of the background spacetime, the equilibrium torus exists only in the small swirling case. With the increase of the swirling parameter, the disk structure becomes small and the excretion of matter near the black hole becomes strong. Moreover, the odd\(Z_2\)symmetry of spacetimes originating from the swirling parameter yields that the orientation of closed equipotential surfaces deviates away from the horizontal axis and the corresponding disk does not longer possess the symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane. These significant features could help to further understand the equilibrium tori and geometrically thick accretion disks around black holes in swirling universes.
In this paper, we investigate Morris–Thorne-type wormholes with global monopole charge using various shape function forms known in the literature. We solve the Einstein field equations incorporating an anisotropic energy–momentum tensor and obtain different physical quantities associated with the matter-content. A crucial aspect of this study is the non-exotic matter distribution, examined through the evaluation of energy conditions, and exploring how different shape functions impact these conditions. Additionally, the anisotropy parameter is calculated to quantify the extent of attractive or repulsive behavior. Our study demonstrates that for different types of shape function forms, the energy conditions are influenced by the global monopole parameter. Our findings provide valuable insights for further theoretical explorations of these fascinating hypothetical structures in the realm of general relativity and beyond.
The maximum entropy spectral analysis (MESA) method, developed by Burg, offers a powerful tool for spectral estimation of a time-series. It relies on Jaynes’ maximum entropy principle, allowing the spectrum of a stochastic process to be inferred using the coefficients of an autoregressive process AR(p) of orderp. A closed-form recursive solution provides estimates for both the autoregressive coefficients and the orderpof the process. We provide a ready-to-use implementation of this algorithm in a Python package calledmemspectrum, characterized through power spectral density (PSD) analysis on synthetic data with known PSD and comparisons of different criteria for stopping the recursion. Additionally, we compare the performance of our implementation with the ubiquitous Welch algorithm, using synthetic data generated from the GW150914 strain spectrum released by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration. Our findings indicate that Burg’s method provides PSD estimates with systematically lower variance and bias. This is particularly manifest in the case of a small (O(5000)) number of data points, making Burg’s method most suitable to work in this regime. Since this is close to the typical length of analysed gravitational waves data, improving the estimate of the PSD in this regime leads to more reliable posterior profiles for the system under study. We conclude our investigation by utilising MESA, and its particularly easy parametrisation where the only free parameter is the order p of the AR process, to marginalise over the interferometers noise PSD in conjunction with inferring the parameters of GW150914
The Belle collaboration recently reported a pro-mising candidate for the spin-2\(D^*\bar{D}^*\)partner of theX(3872), called the\(X_2\)for short, having a mass of\((4014.3 \pm 4.0 \pm 1.5)~\textrm{MeV}\)and a width of\((4 \pm 11 \pm 6)~\textrm{MeV} \). In present work, we assume the\(X_2\)as a pure molecule of the\(D^*\bar{D}^*\)under four cases, i.e., pure neutral components (\(\theta = 0\)), isospin singlet (\(\theta = \pi /4\)), neutral components dominant (\(\theta = \pi /6\)), and purely charged components (\(\theta = \pi /2\)), where\(\theta \)is a phase angle describing the proportion of neutral and charged constituents. Using an effective Lagrangian approach, we calculated the partial widths of\(X_2\rightarrow VV\)and\(X_2 \rightarrow PP\)(VandPstand for light vector and pseudoscalar mesons, respectively). The predicted decay widths of\(X_2 \rightarrow VV\)can reach a few hundreds of\(\textrm{keV}\), while the decay widths of\(X_2 \rightarrow PP\)are about several tens of\(\textrm{keV}\). In addition, the effects from the proportion of neutral and charged constituent on the decay widths of\(X_2\rightarrow VV\)andPPare also investigated. We hope that the present calculations will be checked experimentally in the future.
In this work, we investigate the collective flow development in high energy proton proton (pp) collisions with a multiphase transport model (AMPT) based on PYTHIA8 initial conditions with a sub-nucleon structure. It is found that the PYTHIA8 based AMPT model can reasonably describe both the charged hadron productions and elliptic flow experimental data measured in pp collisions at\(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV. By turning on the parton and hadron rescatterings in AMPT separately, we find that the observed collective flow in pp collisions is largely developed during the parton evolution, while no significant flow effect can be generated with the pure hadronic rescatterings. It is also shown that the parton escape mechanism is important for describing both the magnitude of the two-particle cumulant and the sign of the four-particle cumulants. We emphasize that the strong mass ordering of the elliptic flow results from the coalescence process in the transport model and can thus be regarded as unique evidence related to the creation of deconfined parton matter in high energy pp collisions.
As we know, the horizon area of a black hole will increase when it absorbs matter. Based on Barrow’s concept of a fractal black hole horizon, it has been proposed (Phys Lett B 831:137181, 2022) that for a spherically fractal structure, the minimum increase in the horizon area is the area of the smallest bubble sphere. The corresponding black hole entropy is of a logarithmic form, which is similar to that of Boltzmann entropy under a certain condition. Based on this, we re-derive the entropy of Barrow’s Einstein–power-Yang–Mills (EPYM) anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole, and calculate its temperature and heat capacity. There exists an interesting phenomenon wherein the ratio between Barrow’s temperature and the Hawking temperature of the EPYM AdS black hole is fully consistent with that of other Schwarzschild-like black holes. The Barrow and Hawking temperatures within a certain range of\(\Lambda \)are found to increase monotonically, and the corresponding heat capacities are all positive, which means that these black holes are thermodynamically stable. In addition, for Barrow’s EPYM AdS black hole, its heat capacity has a Schottky anomaly-like behavior, which may reflect the existence of a discrete energy level and microscopic degrees of freedom.
We study the behavior of static, spherically symmetric solutions to the field equations of scalar–tensor theories (STT) of gravity belonging to the Bergmann–Wagoner–Nordtvedt class, in the presence of an electric and/or magnetic charge. This class of theories includes the Brans–Dicke, Barker and Schwinger STT as well as nonminimally coupled scalar fields with an arbitrary parameter\(\xi \). The study is restricted to canonical (nonphantom) versions of the theories and scalar fields without a self-interaction potential. Only radial (monopole) perturbations are considered as the most likely ones to cause an instability. The static background solutions contain naked singularities, but we formulate the boundary conditions in such a way that would preserve their meaning if a singularity is smoothed, for example, due to quantum gravity effects. These boundary conditions look more physical than those used by other authors. Since the solutions of all STT under study are related by conformal transformations, the stability problem for all of them reduces to the same wave equation, but the boundary conditions for perturbations (and sometimes the boundaries themselves) are different in different STT, which affects the stability results. The stability or instability conclusions are obtained for different branches of solutions in the theories under consideration and are presented in a table form.
Cygnusis a proposed global network of large-scale gas time projection chambers (TPCs) with the capability of directionally detecting nuclear and electron recoils at\(\gtrsim \)keV energies. The primary focus ofCygnusso far has been the detection of dark matter, with directional sensitivity providing a means of circumventing the so-called “neutrino fog”. However, the excellent background rejection and electron/nuclear recoil discrimination provided by the 3-dimensional reconstruction of ionisation tracks could turn the solar neutrino background into an interesting signal in its own right. For example, directionality would facilitate the simultaneous spectroscopy of multiple different flux sources. Here, we evaluate the possibility of measuring solar neutrinos using the same network of gas TPCs built from 10 m\(^3\)-scale modules operating under conditions that enable simultaneous sensitivity to both dark matter and neutrinos. We focus in particular on electron recoils, which provide access to low-energy neutrino fluxes likepp,pep,\(^7\)Be, and CNO. An appreciable event rate is already detectable in experiments consisting of a single 10 m\(^3\)module, assuming standard fill gases such as CF\(_4\)mixed with helium at atmospheric pressure. With total volumes around 1000 m\(^3\)or higher, the TPC network could be complementary to dedicated neutrino observatories, whilst entering the dark-matter neutrino fog via the nuclear recoil channel. We evaluate the required directional performance and background conditions to observe, discriminate, and perform spectroscopy on neutrino events. We find that, under reasonable projections for planned technology that will enable 10–30-degree angular resolution and\(\sim 10\)% fractional energy resolution,Cygnuscould be a competitive directional neutrino experiment.
The dark matter halo has non-negligible effects on the gravitational lensing of supermassive black hole in the galaxy center. Our work presents a study on the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing of black holes enclosed by dark matter halos. To provide a precise description on the distribution of dark matter in galaxies, we choose several famous phenomenological dark matter halo models in astrophysics, including the NFW, Beta, Burkert and Moore models, to carry out the present study. Through numerically calculating the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing, a comparative analysis of the dark matter effects within different halo models has been performed. Assuming typical length scales associated with the galactic gravitational lensing, numerical results indicate that the NFW, Beta, Burkert and Moore dark matter halos can significantly enhance the time delay of light in gravitational lenisng of central supermassive black holes. The enhancing effect becomes more pronounced with a small dark matter halo scale and an increasing dark matter halo mass.
We explore the possibility of detecting the couplings of axion-like particle (ALP) with leptons from their loop-level impact on the ALP couplings to electroweak (EW) gauge bosons via the signal processat the circular electron positron collider (CEPC) and obtain prospective sensitivities to the ALP-lepton couplings. Our numerical results show that the CEPC with the center of mass energy\(\sqrt{s}=240~(91)\)GeV and the integrated luminosity\(\mathcal {L}=5.6~(16)\)\(\hbox {ab}^{-1}\)might be sensitive for probing the ALP-lepton couplings in the ALP mass range from 10 GeV to 130 (50) GeV, where the prospective sensitivities to the ALP-neutrino coupling\(Tr(g_{a\nu \nu })/f_a\)can be as low as 0.016 (0.012)\(\hbox {GeV}^{-1}\)and\(0.0031~(2.8 \times 10^{-4})\)\(\hbox {GeV}^{-1}\)for\(c_{R}=0\)and\(c_{R}=c_{L}\), and to the ALP-charged lepton coupling\(Tr(g_{a\ell \ell })/f_a\)can be as low as 0.035 (0.07)\(\hbox {GeV}^{-1}\)for\(c_{L}=0\). We find that the prospective sensitivities given by the CEPC are not covered by the current and expected exclusion regions in some ALP mass intervals. The CEPC has the potential for exploring the ALP-neutrino couplings via some promising processes induced by the ALP-EW gauge boson couplings in the future.
We investigate the medium modifications in mass and decay width of\(\phi \)meson in the presence of an external magnetic field. The in-medium mass of\(\phi \)meson has been calculated using the decay process\(\phi \)\(\rightarrow \)\(K {\bar{K}}\)at one-loop level. The medium modifications are introduced by using a chiral SU(3) model employing a mean-field effective approach. Due to the introduction of the magnetic field, masses of charged\(K^+\)and\(K^-\)increases with advancing magnetic field values. A negligible change in the value of neutral\(K^0\)and\({\bar{K}}^0\)has been observed for varying magnetic fields. Due to electromagnetic interactions with chargedKand\({\bar{K}}\)mesons, there is a gradual augmentation in the effective mass of\(\phi \)meson. The probability of the mentioned decay process ceases to be zero for low density and strangeness fraction values at higher magnetic field values. Investigating the decay width and effective mass of\(\phi \)meson under the influence of an external magnetic field is relevant to understanding the hadronic matter properties under extreme conditions achievable at heavy-ion collision experiments.
This paper is designed for heavy pulsars coming from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer. The research model is describe by Einstein field equations for anisotropic fluid configuration with spherical symmetry. As per present perceptiveness, modified non-linear Van der Waals equation of state is used to relate physical variables. The continuity of inner and outer matter is obtained by comparing inner spacetime to outer Schwarzschild metric. The physical viability of this model is evaluated and further it is compared with observational data of pulsars PSR J0348+0432, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451. The model fulfils all physical and mathematical characteristics of the dense structure studies. It offers the factual proofs carried by evolution of celestial configurations. The working model presented here is physically viable and shows stable behaviour.
In high-energy particle collisions, the reconstruction of secondary vertices from heavy-flavour hadron decays is crucial for identifying and studying jets initiated byb- orc-quarks. Traditional methods, while effective, require extensive manual optimisation and struggle to perform consistently across wide regions of phase space. Meanwhile, recent advancements in machine learning have improved performance but are unable to fully reconstruct multiple vertices. In this work we propose a novel approach to secondary vertex reconstruction based on recent advancements in object detection and computer vision. Our method directly predicts the presence and properties of an arbitrary number of vertices in a single model. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing techniques. Applied to simulated proton-proton collision events, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in vertex finding efficiency, achieving a 10% improvement over an existing state-of-the-art method. Moreover, it enables vertex fitting, providing accurate estimates of key vertex properties such as transverse momentum, radial flight distance, and angular displacement from the jet axis. When integrated into a flavour tagging pipeline, our method yields a 50% improvement in light-jet rejection and a 15% improvement inc-jet rejection at ab-jet selection efficiency of 70%. These results demonstrate the potential of adapting advanced object detection techniques for particle physics, and pave the way for more powerful and flexible reconstruction tools in high-energy physics experiments.
We study a long-overlooked CP violation observable, termed double-mixing CP violation, which arises from the interference between two neutral meson oscillating paths involved in a decay chain. The double-mixing CP violation is beneficial for the precise test of the Standard Model CKM mechanism, as it offers the potential to extract weak phases without pollution from strong dynamics. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the double-mixing CP violation, we perform phenomenological analyses on the cascade decays of the\(B^0_d\)and\(B^0_s\)mesons. Our results show that the double-mixing CP violation can be very significant in certain decay channels, such as\(B^0_d \rightarrow J/\psi K \rightarrow J/\psi (\pi ^+\ell ^-{\bar{\nu }}_\ell )\), where the total CP violation arises almost entirely from the double-mixing CP violation. In addition, we employ the decay process\(B^0_d \rightarrow D^0 K \rightarrow (K^-\pi ^+)(\pi \ell \nu )\)to demonstrate that the involved strong and weak phases can be directly determined from the experimental data without any theoretical inputs. Specifically, the overall weak phase of this process is\(2\beta +\gamma \), which is of significant importance for extracting the CKM phase angles. We also use\(B^0_s \rightarrow \rho ^0 K \rightarrow \rho ^0(\pi ^-\ell ^+\nu _\ell )\)to illustrate and discuss the significant importance of\(K^0_S - K^0_L\)interference.
The study of neutrino oscillation at accelerators is limited by systematic uncertainties, in particular on the neutrino flux, cross section, and energy estimates. These systematic uncertainties could be eliminated by a novel experimental technique: neutrino tagging. This technique relies on a new type of neutrino beamline and its associated instrumentation which would enable the kinematic reconstruction of the neutrinos produced inanddecays. This article presents a proof-of-concept study for such a tagged beamline, aiming to serve a long-baseline neutrino experiment exploiting a megaton scale natural water Cherenkov detector. After optimising the target and the beamline optics to first order, a complete Monte Carlo simulation of the beamline has been performed. The results show that the beamline provides a meson beam compatible with the operation of the spectrometer, and delivers a neutrino flux sufficient to collect neutrino samples with a size comparable with similar experiments and with other un-tagged long-baseline neutrino experimental proposals.
In this work, we study metric-Palatini gravity extended by the antisymmetric part of the affine curvature. This gravity theory leads to general relativity plus a geometric Proca field. Using our previous construction of its static spherically-symmetric AdS solution (Eur Phys J. C 83(4):318, 2023), we perform a detailed analysis in this work using the observational quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) data. To this end, we use the latest data from stellar-mass black hole GRO J1655-40, intermediate-mass black hole in M82-X1, and the super-massive black hole in SgA* (our Milky Way) and perform a Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain (MCMC) analysis to determine or bound the model parameters. Our results shed light on the allowed ranges of the Proca mass and other parameters. The results imply that our solutions can cover all three astrophysical black holes. Our analysis can also be extended to more general metric-affine gravity theories.
In this short note we perform canonical analysis of the theory invariant under restricted diffeomorphism so that the action contains kinetic term for determinant of metric. We find corresponding Hamiltonian and determine structure of constraints.
In this paper we consider a high energy scattering of free scalar particles through a gravitational field. The one particle t-channel amplitude of the scattering in this limit is governed by reggeized graviton. Therefore, we discuss an appearance of the reggeized gravitons in the framework of Einstein–Hilbert gravity and consider Lipatov’s effective action for the reggeized gravitons. We calculate the trajectory of the correspondingt-channel amplitude in the framework and thereafter define the leading order amplitude of scattering of two massive scalar particles. An impact factor of the interaction of scalar particle with the reggeized gravitons is also calculated and possible applications of the approach are discussed as well.
We investigate the effects of inclusion of charged tachyonic open-string scalars in the perturbative and the non-perturbative Kähler moduli stabilizations in a geometry of three intersecting magnetized D7-brane stacks in type-IIB/F theory and also study the overall influence of this process on the inflaton potential, in a hybrid inflation scenario. We find that a tachyon lowers the minimum of the inflaton potential and assists to end the inflation. For simplicity, we have included one tachyon at a time in the present work and observe that this procedure preserves the features of slow-roll plateau of the potential. An interesting observation here is that the tachyonic part of the potential can be fine-tuned to get an almost zero minimum of the potential, thereby conforming to the small experimental value of thecosmological constant.
There is growing interest in the overlap reduction function in pulsar timing array observations as a probe of modified gravity. However, current approximations to the Hellings–Downs curve for subluminal gravitational wave propagation, say\(v<1\), diverge at small angular pulsar separation. In this paper, we find that the overlap reduction function for the\(v<1\)case is sensitive to finite distance effects. First, we show that finite distance effects introduce an effective cut-off in the spherical harmonics decomposition at\(\ell \sim \sqrt{1-v^2} \, kL\), where\(\ell \)is the multipole number,kthe wavenumber of the gravitational wave andLthe distance to the pulsars. Then, we find that the overlap reduction function in the small angle limit approaches a value given by\(\pi kL\,v^2\,(1-v^2)^2\)times a normalization factor, exactly matching the value for the autocorrelation recently derived. Although we focus on the\(v<1\)case, our formulation is valid for any value ofv.
Vbfnlois a flexible parton level Monte Carlo program for the simulation of vector boson fusion (VBF), QCD-induced single and double vector boson production plus two jets, and double and triple vector boson production (plus jet) in hadronic collisions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant, as well as Higgs boson plus two and three jet production via gluon fusion at the one-loop level. For the new version –Version 3.0– several major enhancements have been included. An interface according to the Binoth Les Houches Accord (BLHA) has been added for all VBF and di/tri-boson processes including fully leptonic decays. For all dimension-8 operators affecting vector boson scattering (VBS) processes, a modified T-matrix unitarization procedure has been implemented. Several new production processes have been added, namely the VBS\(Z\gamma jj\)and\(\gamma \gamma jj\)processes at NLO,\(\gamma \gamma jj \),WWjandZZjproduction at NLO including the loop-induced gluon-fusion contributions and the gluon-fusion one-loop induced\(\varPhi jjj\)(\(\varPhi \)is a CP-even or CP-odd scalar boson) process at LO, retaining the full top-mass dependence. Finally, the code has been parallelized usingOpenmpi.
Buchdahl star is the most compact object without an event horizon and is an excellent candidate for a black hole mimicker. Unlike black holes, rotating Buchdahl star can be over-extremal with respect to the black hole, sustaining a larger spin. We show that it can also develop an ergosphere above the threshold spin\(\beta > 1/\sqrt{2}\), which allows extraction of its rotational energy. Electromagnetic field around Buchdahl star is also expected to differ from that of black hole in both strength and topology. In this paper, we explore the energetics of Buchdahl star focusing on the magnetic Penrose process in the two magnetic field configurations, i.e., uniform and dipole. Below the threshold spin, Buchdahl star is expected to be quiet, while above the threshold it can be much more efficient than the black hole if a dipolar magnetic field is developed on its surface.
The phase diagram of the Gross–Neveu model in 1+1 dimensions is studied using Ginzburg–Landau expansion. It predicts several features of the exact phase diagram correctly even at low orders. It is shown that increasing the order of the expansion improves the accuracy of the crystal phase except for very small temperatures, where the expansion completely fails regardless of the order of the expansion. The source of this behaviour seems to be related to the Silver-Blaze phenomenon.
Vortex light, characterized by an intrinsic orbital angular momentum aligned with its propagation direction, is described through vortex electromagnetic waves. Similar to the gravitational spin Hall effect (SHE), vortex light is expected to exhibit intrinsic orbital angular momentum dependent trajectories and deviations from the null geodesic plane when propagating through a gravitational field, a phenomenon termed the gravitational orbital Hall effect (OHE). In this work, we model the vortex light as vortex Laguerre–Gaussian electromagnetic wave packets and analyze its motion by solving covariant Maxwell equations within the Lense–Thirring metric. Our findings reveal that the trajectory of vortex light with an intrinsic orbital angular momentum deviates from the null geodesic in two ways. It deviates both perpendicular to, and within, the null geodesic plane. This behavior contrasts with the gravitational SHE, where spin-polarized light primarily deviates perpendicular to the null geodesic plane. Moreover, the relationship between the deviation and intrinsic orbital angular momentum differs significantly from that between the deviation and spin. These results suggest a unique interaction between intrinsic orbital angular momentum and gravity, distinct from the spin-gravity coupling, indicating that the gravitational OHE of light might not be precisely predicted by merely substituting spin with intrinsic orbital angular momentum in the gravitational SHE of light.
In a work by Visser, Bassett and Liberati (VBL) (Nucl Phys B Proc Suppl 88:267, 2000) a relation was suggested between a null energy condition and the censorship of superluminal behaviour. Their result was soon challenged by Gao and Wald (Class Quantum Grav 17:4999, 2000) who argued that this relation is gauge dependent and therefore not appropriate to find such connections. In this paper, we clear up this controversy by showing that both papers are correct but need to be interpreted in distinct paradigms. In this context, we introduce a new paradigm to interpret gravitational phenomena, which we call the Harmonic Background Paradigm. This harmonic background paradigm starts from the idea that there exists a more fundamental background causality provided by a flat spacetime geometry. One of the consequences of this paradigm is that the VBL relation can provide an explanation of why gravity is attractive in all standard weak-field situations.
This paper investigates Buchdahl transformations within the framework of Einstein and Einstein-Scalar theories. Specifically, we establish that the recently proposed Schwarzschild–Levi-Civita spacetime can be obtained by means of a Buchdahl transformation of the Schwarschild metric along the spacelike Killing vector. The study extends Buchdahl’s original theorem by combining it with the Kerr–Schild representation. In doing so, we construct new vacuum-rotating black holes in higher dimensions which can be viewed as the Levi-Civita extensions of the Myers–Perry geometries. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the double copy scheme within these new generated geometries still holds, providing an example of an algebraically general double copy framework. In the context of the Einstein-Scalar system, the paper extends the corresponding Buchdahl theorem to scenarios where a static vacuum seed configuration, transformed with respect to a spacelike Killing vector, generates a hairy black hole spacetime. We analyze the geometrical features of these spacetimes and investigate how a change of frame, via conformal transformations, leads to a new family of black hole spacetimes within the Einstein-Conformal-Scalar system.
Expanding upon our ongoing investigation of Vector-Like Quark (VLQ) phenomenology within a 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) framework, in this paper, we complement a previous one dedicated to Vector-Like Top-quarks (VLTs) by studying Vector-Like Bottom-quarks (VLBs), specifically focusing on their behavior in the alignment limit of a Type-II Yukawa structure. We examine the potential for detecting VLBs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and analyze their decay signatures, encompassing both Standard Model (SM) processes and exotic decays. The objective is to differentiate among singlet, doublet, and triplet configurations of VLBs by identifying distinct decay patterns, thereby providing insights into the structure of Beyond the SM (BSM) physics.
We explore the mechanism that can explain the production of lepton asymmetry and two types of sterile neutrino dark matter. The first type involves heavy sterile dark matter produced directly by the decay of Q-balls which are formed by first-order phase transition in the early universe; the second consists of keV sterile neutrino dark matter, produced resonantly with the aid of lepton asymmetry from Q-ball decay. Besides, gravitational waves from cosmic strings generated during the phase transition process could be detected at future interferometers.
We present the first determination of the value of the strong coupling via a simultaneous global fit of the proton parton distribution functions (PDFs) at approximate\(\textrm{N}^3\)LO (a\(\textrm{N}^3\)LO) order in QCD. This makes use of the MSHT global PDF fitting framework, and in particular the recent theoretical advances t l;;mhat allow a PDF fit to now be performed at this order. The value of the strong coupling is found to be\(\alpha _{S}(M_Z^2)(\mathrm{aN^3LO}) = 0.1170 \pm 0.0016\). This is in excellent agreement with the NNLO value of\( \alpha _{S}(M_Z^2)(\textrm{NNLO}) = 0.1171 \pm 0.0014\), indicating that good perturbative convergence has been found. The resulting uncertainties, calculated using the MSHT dynamic tolerance procedure, are somewhat larger, but more accurate, at a\(\textrm{N}^3\)LO, due to the missing higher order theoretical uncertainties that are included at this order, but not at NNLO. We in addition present a detailed breakdown of the individual dataset sensitivity to the value of the strong coupling, with special focus on the impact of fitting dijet rather than inclusive jet data. This choice is found to have a non-negligible impact, but with overall good consistency found, especially at a\(\textrm{N}^3\)LO.
The DUNE far detector has been designed to detect photons and electrons generated by the charged products of the interaction of neutrinos with a massive liquid argon (LAr) target. The photon detection system (PDS) of the first DUNE far detector (FD1) is composed of 6000 photon detection units, namedX-ARAPUCA. The detection of the prompt light pulse generated by the particle energy release in LAr will complement and boost the DUNE LAr Time Projection Chamber. It will improve the non-beam events tagging and enable at low energies the trigger and the calorimetry of the supernova neutrinos. The X-ARAPUCA is an assembly of several components. Its photon detection efficiency (PDE) depends on the design of the assembly, on the grade of the individual components and on their coupling. The X-ARAPUCA PDE is one of the leading parameters for the PDS sensitivity, that in turn determines the sensitivity of the DUNE for the detection of core-collapse supernova within the galaxy and for nucleon decay searches. In this work we present the final assessment of the absolute PDE of the FD1 X-ARAPUCA baseline design, measured in two laboratories with independent methods and setups. Preliminary results were reported in Palomares. One hundred sixty units of these X-ARAPUCA devices have been deployed in the NP04 facility at the CERN Neutrino Platform, the 1:20 scale FD1 prototype, and will be operated during the year 2024. The assessed value of the PDE is a key parameter both in the NP04 and in the DUNE analysis and reconstruction studies.
The recent measurement of\(\mathcal {B}(B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu \bar{\nu })\)by Belle-II reveals a\(2.8~\sigma \)deviation from the Standard Model (SM) prediction. Combining this with a prior Belle measurement of\(\mathcal {B}(B^{0}\rightarrow K^{*0}\nu \bar{\nu })\), the upper bound of the ratio\(\mathcal {B}(B^{0}\rightarrow K^{*0}\nu \bar{\nu })/\mathcal {B}(B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu \bar{\nu })\)is notably smaller than the SM prediction. In this work, tensions are solved within the framework of Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT). The flavor-changing-neutral-current (FCNC) and charged-current observables of either down-type (\(b\rightarrow s\nu \bar{\nu }\),\(b\rightarrow s\ell ^+\ell ^-\), and\(b\rightarrow u_i\ell \bar{\nu }\)) or up-type (\(u_j\rightarrow u_i\nu \bar{\nu }\),\(u_j\rightarrow u_i\ell ^+\ell ^-\), and\(u_j\rightarrow s\ell \bar{\nu }\)) processes, described by low-energy effective field theory (LEFT) operators, are interconnected by a minimal set of four SMEFT operators at the electroweak scale. Subsequently, we obtain the latest ranges of Wilson coefficients for these four operators through a global fit that accommodates flavor anomalies such as\(R_{K^{(*)}}\),\(R_{D^{(*)}}\), and\(\mathcal {B}(B\rightarrow K^{(*)}\nu \bar{\nu })\). Our findings reveal that predictions for\(\mathcal {B}(B^+\rightarrow \tau ^+\nu _\tau )\)and\(\mathcal {B}(D_s^+\rightarrow \tau ^+\nu _\tau )\)align well with measured values from Belle and BESIII, based on the fitted coefficients. The predicted branching fraction for\(B^0\rightarrow K^{*0}\nu \bar{\nu }\)is\((1.42\pm 0.74)\times 10^{-5}\), closely approaching the current experimental upper limit. Anticipation surrounds the rare decay\(B_s\rightarrow \tau ^+ \tau ^-\), expected in the near future with a branching fraction on the order of\(10^{-4}\).
Isospin symmetry is the most precise flavor symmetry. The effective Hamiltonian of charm quark weak decay is zero under the isospin lowering operators\(I_-^n\), which permits us to generate isospin sum rules through several master formulas. In this work, we derive the master formulas of isospin sum rules for the two- and three-body non-leptonic decays of singly and doubly charmed baryons. Hundreds of isospin sum rules are derived to test of isospin symmetry and provide hints for the new decay modes. The isospin sum rules for multi-body decays are not broken by the intermediate resonances and hence can be used to study the isospin partners of exotic hadrons.
Results for the full electroweak two-loop contributions of\(\mathcal {O}\left( N_c^2\right) \), where\(N_c\)is the colour factor, to the Higgs-boson masses in the MSSM are obtained using a Feynman-diagrammatic approach including the full dependence on the external momentum. These corrections are expected to constitute the dominant part of the two-loop corrections that were still missing up to now. As a consequence of working at\(\mathcal {O}\left( N_c^2\right) \), the relevant two-loop self-energies decompose into products of one-loop integrals, giving rise to a transparent analytical structure of the self-energies. We compare different renormalisation schemes for\(\tan (\beta )\), the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, and demonstrate under which conditions different renormalisation schemes can be related to each other via a simple reparametrisation. We explicitly show that this is in general not possible for mixed renormalisation schemes due to the presence of evanescent terms. In our numerical analysis, the new corrections are compared with already known two-loop contributions and the experimental uncertainty of the mass of the observed Higgs boson. While smaller than the already known two-loop corrections, the new terms are typically larger in size than the experimental uncertainty. This underlines the relevance of the so-far unknown electroweak two-loop contributions.
An increasing number of experimental measurements from the BESIII, Belle, and Belle-II collaborations encourage investigations into charmed baryon two-body decay processes. By including contributions from the penguin diagrams that are ignored in previous studies, we perform a global analysis with SU(3) flavor symmetry. Assuming all form factors are real, we achieve a remarkable minimal\(\chi ^{2}/d.o.f = 0.788\)and find that the contribution of the amplitude proportional to\(V_{cb}^*V_{ub}\)is of the order\(\sim 0.01\), comparable with the contribution of the tree-level diagram. Additionally, by using the KPW theorem to reduce the number of amplitudes from 13 to 7 in the leading contribution, it becomes possible to consider the complex form factor case for the leading IRA amplitude in the global analysis. However, the analysis of complex form factors significantly conflicts with the experimental data\(Br(\Xi _c^0\rightarrow \Xi ^-\pi ^+)\), and by excluding this data,\(\chi ^2/d.o.f\)is reduced from 5.95 to 1.19. Although the analysis of complex form factors shows a significant central value of the penguin diagram contribution, the large errors from the corresponding form factors make it a challenge to precisely determine its true contribution. Consequently, the direct CP violation in decay processes is predicted to be approximately zero. With more data in future experiments, the penguin diagram contribution with the amplitude proportional to\(V_{cb}^*V_{ub}\)will be precisely determined, allowing for a more accurate prediction of CP violation. Our analysis necessitates further theoretical investigations and experimental measurements in the future.
The Israel–Carter theorem (also known as the “no-hair theorem”) puts a restriction on the existence of parameters other than mass, electric charge, and angular momentum of a black hole. In this context, Bekenstein proposed no-hair theorems in various black hole models with neutral and electrically charged scalar fields. In this paper, we take the Einstein–Maxwell-charged scalar model with an electrically charged scalar field gauge-coupled to the Maxwell field surrounding a charged black hole with a static spherically symmetric metric. In particular, we consider a quadratic scalar potential without any higher order terms and we do not impose any restriction on the magnitude of the scalar charge with respect to the black hole charge. With this setting, we ascertain the validity of all energy conditions coupled with the causality condition, suggesting the possibility of existence of charged hairy solutions. Consequently, we obtain, by exact numerical integration, detailed solutions of the field equations that incorporate backreaction on the spacetime due to the presence of the charged scalar field. The solutions exhibit damped oscillatory behaviours for the charged scalar hair. We also find that the electric potential is a monotonic function of the radial coordinate, as required by electrodynamics. In order to ascertain the existence of our charged hairy solutions, we carry out dynamic stability analyses against time-dependant perturbations about the static solutions. For a definite conclusion, we employ two different methodologies. The first methodology involves a Sturm–Liouville equation, whereas the second methodology employs a Schrödinger-like equation, for the dynamic perturbations. We find that our solutions are stable against time-dependant perturbations by both methodologies, confirming the existence of the charged hairy solutions.
Observable scattering processes entail emission-absorption of soft photons. As these degrees of freedom go undetected, some information is lost. Whether some of this information can be recovered in the observation of the hard particles, depends of the actual pattern of the scrambling of information. We compute the information scrambling of electron and soft photon scattering by the tripartite mutual information in terms of the 2-Renyi entropy, and find a finite amount of scrambling is present. We show that scrambling is a byproduct of decoherence achieved by the scattering system in its interaction with the environment, due to the emission-absorption of soft photons in fully unitary processes.
In this paper we treat some aspects of the LARES 2 space experiment to test the general relativistic phenomenon of dragging of inertial frames, or frame-dragging, in particular we discuss some aspects of its relative accuracy which can approach one part in a thousand. We then, once again respond to the criticisms of the author of a recent paper about the accuracy in the measurement of frame-dragging with LARES 2. The claims of such a paper are not reproducible in any independent analyses. Indeed, it claims that the accuracy in the test of frame-dragging, which can be reached by the LARES 2 space experiment, is several orders of magnitude larger than previously estimated in a number of papers. Here we show that such a paper is based on a number of significant misunderstandings and conceptual mistakes. Furthermore, it is puzzling to observe that previous papers by the same author contained completely opposite statements about the accuracy which can be reached using two satellites with supplementary inclinations, such as in the LARES 2 space experiment, and in general with laser-ranged satellites.
In recent times, the sensitivity of low-mass direct dark matter searches has been limited by unknown low energy backgrounds close to the energy threshold of the experiments known as the low energy excess (LEE). The CRESST experiment utilises advanced cryogenic detectors constructed with different types of crystals equipped with Transition Edge Sensors (TESs) to measure signals of nuclear recoils induced by the scattering of dark matter particles in the detector. In CRESST, this low energy background manifests itself as a steeply rising population of events below 200 eV. A novel detector design named doubleTES using two identical TESs on the target crystal was studied to investigate the hypothesis that the events are sensor-related. We present the first results from two such modules, demonstrating their ability to differentiate between events originating from the crystal’s bulk and those occurring in the sensor or in its close proximity.
The production of doubleP-wave heavy quarkonia is studied systematically within the framework of non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics at the exclusive process of the electron–positron collision annihilation at the CM energy\(\sqrt{s}=91.1876\)GeV of the\(Z^0\)pole, i.e., doubleP-wave charmonia, doubleP-wave\(B_c\)mesons, and doubleP-wave bottomonia in\(e^+e^-\rightarrow \gamma ^*/Z^0 \rightarrow |(Q\bar{Q'})[n]\rangle +|(Q'\bar{Q})[n^\prime ]\rangle \)(\(Q/Q'=c\)- orb-quarks) at a future superZfactory, where [n] or\([n^\prime ]\)stands for the color-singlet\([^1P_1]\)and\([^3P_J]\)(\(J=0,1,2\)) Fock states. As an improved trace technology is useful for calculating the complicated doubleP-wave channels, the analytical result can be obtained at the amplitude level. According to our study, the generation rates for the doubleP-wave heavy quarkonia at the future superZfactory are considerable. The values obtained for the total cross sections of the doubleP-wave charmonium for\(\sigma {(|(c\bar{c})[1]\rangle +|(c\bar{c})[1]\rangle )}=4.191^{+0.489}_{-0.498}\times 10^{-3}~fb\), the total cross sections of the doubleP-wave\(B_c\)mesons for\(\sigma {(|(c\bar{b})[1]\rangle +|(b\bar{c})[1]\rangle )}=0.2045^{+0.0084}_{-0.0080}~fb\), and the total cross sections of the doubleP-wave bottomonium for\(\sigma {(|(b\bar{b})[1]\rangle +|(b\bar{b})[1]\rangle )}=5.244^{+0.134}_{-0.136}\times 10^{-3}~fb\). The main uncertainties come from the mass of heavy quarkonia and the corresponding first-derivative radial wave functions at the origin under the Buchmüller–Tye (BT) potential. The number of events in the production of doubleP-wave charmonium,\(B_c\)-meson, and bottomonium states via\(e^-e^+\rightarrow \gamma ^*/Z^0 \rightarrow |(Q\bar{Q}')[n]\rangle + |(Q'\bar{Q})[n^\prime ]\rangle \)at the integrated luminosity\(\mathcal{L}\approx 10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)at the superZfactory is almost unobservable.
We investigate the non-perturbatively generated axion-like particle (ALP) potential, involving fermions in the dark sector that couple to the ALP, in an early universe cosmological inflationary stage with the ALP being a spectator field. The potential here deviates from the standard cosine nature  due to the presence of the two dark sector fermion masses\(m_u\)and\(m_d\)which couple to the ALP. The ALP is a spectator field during inflation but it starts to oscillate and dominates the energy density of the universe after inflation ends, thereby sourcing isocurvature perturbations, while standard curvature fluctuations from the inflaton are assumed to be sub-dominant. Subsequently the ALP decays converting the isocurvature perturbations to adiabatic perturbations thereby acting as the origin of the primordial density perturbations. We identify the parameter space involving the axion decay constant\(f_{\phi }\), scale of confinement\(\Lambda \), ALP massmand the masses of the fermions,\(m_u\)and\(m_d\)where it can satisfactorily behave as the curvaton and source the observed primordial density perturbation. We also predict local non-Gaussianity signals for bi-spectrum and tri-spectrum\(f_{NL}\)and\(g_{NL}\), as a function of the ratio\(m_u/m_d\), which are within the allowed range in the latest Planck observations and are detectable with future observations. Particularly we find that the value of\(f_{NL}\)and\(g_{NL}\)are dependent on the ratio of\(m_u\)and\(m_d\):\(f_{NL}\)is more or less positive for all scenarios except\(m_u = m_d\)and\(g_{NL}\)is always positive irrespective of the ratio between\(m_u\)and\(m_d\). The results of our analysis in the limit\(m_u = m_d\)resembles vanilla curvaton scenario while in the limit\(m_u \gg m_d\)resembles pure axion cosine potential. This is because the model has the unique feature where the extra matter in the dark sector determines the nature and shape of the potential.
Radially extended disk winds could be the key to unlocking how protoplanetary disks accrete and how planets form and migrate. A distinctive characteristic is their nested morphology of velocity and chemistry. Here we report James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared spectrograph spectro-imaging of four young stars with edge-on disks, three of which have already dispersed their natal envelopes. For each source, a fast collimated jet traced by [Feii] is nested inside a hollow cavity within wider lower-velocity H2. In one case, a hollow structure is also seen in CO ro-vibrational (v= 1 → 0) emission but with a wider opening angle than the H2, and both of those are nested inside an Atacama Large Millimeter Array CO (J= 2 → 1) cone with an even wider opening angle. This nested morphology, even for sources with no envelope, strongly supports theoretical predictions for wind-driven accretion and underscores the need for theoretical work to assess the role of winds in the formation and evolution of planetary systems.
Here we analyze the expectation value of the fermionic condensate and the energy–momentum tensor associated with a massive charged fermionic quantum field with a nonzero chemical potential propagating in a magnetic-flux-carrying cosmic string in thermal equilibrium at finite temperatureT. The expectation values of the fermionic condensate and the energy–momentum tensor are expressed as the sum of vacuum expectation values and the finite temperature contributions coming from the particles and antiparticles excitation. The thermal expectations values of the fermionic condensate and the energy–momentum tensor are even periodic functions of the magnetic flux with period being the quantum flux, and also even functions of the chemical potential. Because the analyses of vacuum expectation of the fermionic condensate and energy–momentum tensor have been developed in literature, here we are mainly interested in the investigation of the thermal corrections. In this way we explicitly study how these observable behaves in the limits of low and high temperatures, and also for points near the string. Besides the analytical discussions, we included some graphs that exhibit the behavior of these observable for different values of the physical parameters of the model.
The study delves into the production of (multi-) strange hadrons in proton-proton collisions at LHC. Novel observables are proposed to distinguish betweenEpos4, based on core-corona separation between a thermalised QGP phase and a vacuum phase with global strangeness conservation, andPythia 8.3, based on microscopic interactions between Lund strings that conserve strangeness locally. Correlations between a\(\phi \)meson and (multi-)strange hadrons are shown to be an excellent discriminator between the two types of models.
Dark matter, an important portion of compact objects, can influence different phenomena in neutron stars. The spontaneous scalarization in the scalar-tensor gravity has been proposed for neutron stars. Here, we investigate the spontaneous scalarization in dark matter admixed neutron stars. Applying the dark matter equations of state, we calculate the structure of scalarized neutron stars containing dark matter. The dark matter equations of state are based on observational data from the rotational curves of galaxies and the fermionic self-interacting dark matter. Our results verify that the spontaneous scalarization is affected by the dark matter pressure in neutron stars. Depending on the central density of scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars, the dark matter pressure alters the central scalar field. The increase of dark matter pressure in low-density scalarized stars amplifies the central scalar field. However, the pressure of dark matter in high-density scalarized stars suppresses the central scalar field. Our calculations confirm that the stars in the merger event GW170817 and in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 can be scalarized dark matter admixed neutron stars.
In the era of gravitational waves physics, when detections of wave fronts are increasing in number, sensitivity, frequencies and distances, gravitational physics has entered a period of maximum activity and brilliance. This has open a new window where General Relativity can be challenged in both weak as strong-field regimes. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of gravitational waves propagation and emission in the weak-field regime for gravitational theories within the Palatini formalism. Our results show that gravitational waves propagation in vacuum matches General Relativity predictions as well as the functional form of the multipolar expansion when considering weak sources. However, a rescaling of the gravitational constant arises, which affects the energy radiated by the gravitational waves emission.
Wave equations for some curved spacetimes may involve functions that prevent a solution in a closed form. In some cases, these functions can be eliminated by transformations and the solutions can be found analytically. In the cases where such transformations are not available, the infinite series expansions of these functions can be convoluted with the power series solution ansatz. We study such an example where the solution is based on a special function.
The ratio of branching ratios of theWboson to muons and electrons,\(R^{\,\mu /e}_W={{\mathcal {B}}(W\rightarrow \mu \nu )}\)/\({{\mathcal {B}}(W\rightarrow e\nu )}\), has been measured using\(140\,\text{ fb}^{-1}\,\)ofppcollision data at\(\sqrt{s}=13\)\(\text {T}\text {e}\hspace{-1.00006pt}\text {V}\)collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, probing the universality of lepton couplings. The ratio is obtained from measurements of the\(t\bar{t}\)production cross-section in theee,\(e\mu \)and\(\mu \mu \)dilepton final states. To reduce systematic uncertainties, it is normalised by the square root of the corresponding ratio\(R^{\,\mu \mu /ee}_Z\)for theZboson measured in inclusive\(Z\rightarrow ee\)and\(Z\rightarrow \mu \mu \)events. By using the precise value of\(R^{\,\mu \mu /ee}_Z\)determined from\(e^+e^-\)colliders, the ratio\(R^{\,\mu /e}_W\)is determined to be$$\begin{aligned} R^{\,\mu /e}_W&= 0.9995\pm 0.0022\,\mathrm {(stat)}\,\pm 0.0036\,\mathrm {(syst)}\\  &\quad \pm 0.0014\,\mathrm {(ext)} . \end{aligned}$$The three uncertainties correspond to data statistics, experimental systematics and the external measurement of\(R^{\,\mu \mu /ee}_Z\), giving a total uncertainty of 0.0045, and confirming the Standard Model assumption of lepton flavour universality inW-boson decays at the 0.5% level.
We investigate the implications of the constraints following from the precise knowledge of the total Earth mass,\(M_\oplus \), and moment of inertia,\(I_\oplus \), and from the requirement that Earth be in hydrostatic equilibrium (EHE), in the neutrino tomography studies of the Earth density structure. In order to estimate the sensitivity of a given neutrino detector to possible deviations of the inner core (IC), outer core (OC), core (IC + OC) and mantle Earth densities from those obtained using geophysical and seismological data and described by the preliminary reference Earth model (PREM), in the statistical analyses performed within the neutrino tomography studies one typically varies the density of each of these structures. These variations, however, must respect the\(M_\oplus \),\(I_\oplus \)and EHE constraints. Working with PREM average densities we derive the\(M_\oplus \),\(I_\oplus \)and EHE constraints on the possible density variations when one approximates the Earth density structure with (i) three layers – mantle, outer core and inner core, and (ii) four layers – upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core and inner core. We get drastically different results in the two cases.
Currently there is no general theory of quantum tunnelling of a particle through a potential barrier which is compatible with QFT. We present a complete calculation of tunnelling amplitudes for a scalar field for some simple potentials using quantum field-theoretic methods. Using the perturbativeS-matrix formalism, starting with the Klein–Gordon Lagrangian, we show that an infinite summation of Feynman diagrams can recover tunnelling amplitudes consistent with relativistic quantum mechanics. While this work does not include many-particle effects arising from a fully quantised QFT, it is necessary to investigate QFT corrections to tunnelling amplitudes.
This paper investigates charged particle deflection in a Kerr spacetime background with a dipole magnetic field, focusing on the equatorial plane and employing the weak field approximation. We employ the Jacobi–Randers metric to unify the treatment of the gravitational and electromagnetic effects on charged particles. Furthermore, we utilize the Gauss–Bonnet theorem to calculate the deflection angle through curvature integrals. The difference between the prograde and retrograde deflection angles is linked to the non-reversibility of metrics and geodesics in Finsler geometry, revealing that this difference can be considered a Finslerian effect. We analyze the impact of both gravitomagnetic field and dipole magnetic field on particle motion and deflection using the Jacobi–Randers magnetic field. The model considered in this paper exhibits interesting features in the second-order approximation of (M/b), i.e., the ratio between the spacetime mass and impact parameters. When\(q\mu =2MaE\), where\(q,\,E\)are the charge and asymptotic energy of the charged particle and\(\mu ,\,a\)are the dipole magnetic moment and spacetime spin, the Jacobi–Randers metric possesses reversible geodesics, leading to equal prograde and retrograde deflection angles. In this case, the gravitomagnetic field and dipole magnetic field cancel each other out, distinguishing it from scenarios involving only the gravitomagnetic field or the dipole magnetic field. We also explore the magnetic field’s impact on gravitational lensing of charged particles.
The theory of the Kauffman bracket, which describes the Jones polynomial as a sum over closed circles formed by the planar resolution of vertices in a knot diagram, can be straightforwardly lifted from\(\mathfrak {sl}(2)\)to\(\mathfrak {sl}(N)\)at arbitraryN– but for a special class ofbipartitediagrams made entirely from the antiparallel lock tangle. Many amusing and important knots and links can be described in this way, from twist and double braid knots to the celebrated Kanenobu knots for even parameters – and for all of them the entire HOMFLY polynomials possess planar decomposition. This provides an approach to evaluation of HOMFLY polynomials, which is complementary to the arborescent calculus, and this opens a new direction to homological techniques, parallel to Khovanov–Rozansky generalizations of the Kauffman calculus. Moreover, this planar calculus is also applicable to other symmetric representations beyond the fundamental one, and to links which are not fully bipartite what is illustrated by examples of Kanenobu-like links.
Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory to study matter under extreme densities. Recent observations from gravitational and electromagnetic waves have enabled constraints on NS properties, such as tidal deformability (related to the tidal Love number) and stellar compactness. Although each of these two NS observables depends strongly on the stellar internal structure, the relation between them (called the Love–Crelation) is known to be equation-of-state insensitive. In this study, we investigate the effects of a possible crystalline phase in the core of hybrid stars (HSs) on the mass–radius and Love–Crelations, where HSs are a subclass of NS models with a quark matter core and a nuclear matter envelope with a sharp phase transition in between. We find that both the maximum mass and the corresponding radius increase as one increases the stiffness of the quark matter core controlled by the speed of sound, while the density discontinuity at the nuclear-quark matter transition effectively softens the equations of state. Deviations of the Love–Crelation for elastic HSs from that of fluid NSs become more pronounced with a larger shear modulus, lower transition pressure, and larger density gap and can be as large as 60%. These findings suggest a potential method for testing the existence of distinct phases within HSs, though deviations are not large enough to be detected with current measurements of the tidal deformability and compactness.
This study investigates the particle’s geodesic motion and accretion around the spherically symmetric Reissner–Nordström black hole coupled with a nonlinear electrodynamics field. The formation of the disc-like structure in the accretion process arises from the geodesic motion exhibited by particles near the black hole. In the equatorial plane, we analyze the circular orbits of particles and their stability in detail. The analysis of the fluid’s critical flow, maximum accretion rate, radiant flux energy, radioactive efficiency, and radiant temperature are also examined near the central object. We analyze the perturbations experienced by particles throughout, employing restoring forces and the oscillatory behavior of the particles around the black hole. Our results show that the NED parameter\(\zeta \)affects the circular geodesics of particles and the maximum accretion rate of the Reissner–Nordström black hole coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics.
In the present article, A new class of singularity-free charged anisotropic stars is derived inf(Q)-gravity regime. To solve the field equations, we assume a particular form of anisotropy along with an electric field and obtain a new exact solution inf(Q)-gravity. The explicit mathematical expression for the model parameters is derived by the smooth joining of the obtained solutions with the exterior Reissner–Nordstrom de-Sitter solution across the bounding surface of a compact star along with the requirement that the radial pressure vanishes at the boundary. We have modeled four self-gravitating pulsar objects such as LMC X-4, PSR J1903+327, PSR J1614-2230, and GW190814 in our current study and predict the radii of these objects that fall between 8 and 10 km. Furthermore, the physical validity of the solution is performed for self-gravitating object PSR J1614-2230 with mass\(1.97\pm 0.04~M_{\odot }\)with radius 10 km. The solution successfully fulfills all the physical requirements along with the stability and hydrostatic equilibrium conditions for a well-behaved model. The non-metricityf(Q)-parameter\(\chi _{_1}\)and electric charge parameter\(\eta \)play an important role in the maximum mass of the objects. The maximum mass increases when\(\chi _{_1}\)and\(\eta \)increase but a non-collapsing stable object can be obtained when\(\chi _{_1}\le 0.0205\)and\(\eta \le 0.0006\).
In this paper, we construct the Dirac stars model composed of two Dirac fields and Einstein gravity in four-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime. We consider the Dirac stars with free field (no self-interacting). Our investigation focuses on understanding the relationship between Arnowitt–Deser–Misner (ADM) mass and binding energy in relation to the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we extend the study to the Dirac stars with self-interacting potentials. For the self-interacting Dirac stars, three types of interactions are examined: only quartic, only sextic, quartic and sextic interactions that is kind of Q-ball type interactions. In these three distinct scenarios, it is essential to investigate the impact of self-interaction constants on Dirac stars. Additionally, we study the Dirac solitons in the AdS background. Finally, we discussed the dependence of the spectral flow of the Dirac Hamiltonian on the model parameters.
Using Laplace transform techniques, we describe the evolution of the color dipole cross section at the leading-order and next-to-leading-order approximations from the Bartels–Golec-Biernat–Kowalski model in a kinematic region of low values of the Bjorken variablexand a wide range of transverse dipole sizer. This evolution method shows that the saturation scale and geometric scaling are retained. We derived analytical results for the integrated and unintegrated color dipole gluon distribution functions and compared them with the CJ15 parameterization group and the unintegrated color dipole gluon distribution models, respectively. The Sudakov form factor in the evolution of the unintegrated color dipole gluon distribution is incorporated, and the results are considered at small and large values of\(k_{t}^{2}\).
The Scibar Cosmic-Ray Telescope (SciCRT) is the most promising detector of the Sierra Negra Cosmic Rays Observatory (SN-CRO). At this location, being a target and a tracker of secondary cosmic rays, the SciCRT offers a high probability of observing solar energetic particles and lower energy galactic cosmic rays (LEGCR); also, it allows the identification of incoming particles by measuring their energy deposition. In this work we present a Geant4-based simulation of the energy deposited by neutrons,\(\gamma \)-rays, protons, electrons and muons in the optimally running SciCRT components. We also calculated the detection efficiency of the SciCRT at its current state. Our simulation results provide new information about the SciCRT detection response that may be used as a basis to estimate and analyze the energy spectra of primary particles.
Though theoretical treatments of quantum tunnelling within single-particle quantum mechanics are well-established, at present, there is no quantum field-theoretic description (QFT) of tunnelling. Due to the single-particle nature of quantum mechanics, many-particle effects arising from quantum field theory are not accounted for. Such many-particle effects, including pair-production, have proved to be essential in resolving the Klein-paradox. This work seeks to determine how quantum corrections affect the tunnelling probability through an external field. We investigate a massive neutral scalar field, which interacts with an external field in accordance with relativistic quantum mechanics. To consider QFT corrections, we include another massive quantised neutral scalar field coupling to the original via a cubic interaction. This study formulates an all-order recursive expression for the loop-corrected scalar propagator, which contains only the class of vertex-corrected Feynman diagrams. This equation applies for general external potentials. Though there is no closed-form analytic solution, we also demonstrate how to approximate the QFT corrections if a perturbative coupling to the quantised field is assumed.
In this article, we have studied some new facets of gravitational collapse, beyond conventional notions of black holes, and naked singularities. The present work is focused on the unresolved problems of theoretical physics concerning the final fate of the gravitational collapse of any massive star. By generalizing the foundational work of Oppenheimer and Snyder (Phys Rev 56:455, 1939), we have considered the homogeneous gravitational collapsing system filled with perfect fluid distributions (devoid of dust fluid) within the framework of GR theory. The article investigates a homogeneous gravitational collapsing system using a parametrization scheme for the expansion-scalar\((\Theta )\)and determining the exact solution of field equations. Further, by employing the known Darmois–Israel boundary condition, we have discussed the solution in more detail, and the model’s physical and geometrical quantities are obtained in terms of stellar mass (M), making it crucial for astrophysical applications. To assess the astrophysical viability of our model, we consider a massive star-\(\beta \)Canis Majorisand throughout this study we have presented a detailed numerical and graphical analysis of our model. The analysis of singularities in the models is conducted through the examination of the apparent horizon. Our findings demonstrate that the star continues to collapse indefinitely in co-moving time, ultimately leading to a space-time singularity-this represents a case of continuous gravitational collapse. We propose that this scenario describes an “Eternal Collapsing Object,” which may be treated as a “mathematical black hole without any finite equilibrium state.” Our presented models undergo rigorous physical tests to ensure their regularity, causality, and stability, and to satisfy the necessary energy conditions.
The hierarchical structure formation of our Universe inherently involves disruptive and chaotic episodes of mass assembly such as galaxy mergers. The level of bulk rotation of the collisionless stellar systems of galaxies reflects to what extent the galaxies, on the other hand, have assembled their stars during tranquil and ordered formation history, which fosters the growth of cohesively rotating structures. Observationally, galaxy populations show a wide spectrum of morphology and shapes, with different levels of rotational support. Despite the obvious variety and complexity, in this work we find that, at a given stellar mass of galaxies, the distribution of the intrinsic spin parameter\({\lambda }_{{R}_{{{\rm{e}}}},{{\rm{intr}}}}\), that is, the normalized specific angular momentum of stars, appears to be universally bimodal among galaxies in all star-formation states and also in different environments. This ubiquitous bimodality in kinematic morphology evolves systematically with star formation and is particularly apparent for transitional galaxies of intermediate star-formation rates, which indicates that star-formation quenching is proceeding separately within two distinct kinematic populations dominated by cold disks and hot spheroids. We show that the two populations also have contrasting recent star-formation histories and metal-enrichment histories, which reveal their divergent pathways to formation and quenching.
In the present work, we investigate the productions of\(X_0(2900)\)and its spin partners in the\(B^+\)decay processes, where\(X_0(2900)\)is regarded as a\(\bar{D}^*K^*\)molecular state. We infer that the initial\(B^+\)meson and the final\(D^+ X_0(2900)\)are connected through the\(D_{s1}^{\prime +}(2460) \bar{D}^{*0} \)mesons by exchanging a\(K^{*0}\)meson. The contributions of such a meson loop to the process\(B^+ \rightarrow D^+ X_0(2900)\)are evaluated and our estimations indicate that the measured branching fraction of\(B^+\rightarrow D^+ X_0(2900)\)could be well reproduced in a reasonable range of model parameters, indicating that\(X_0(2900)\)could be interpreted as a\(\bar{D}^*K^*\)molecular state. In addition, the production processes\(B^+ \rightarrow D^+ \tilde{X}_{1,2}\),\(B^+ \rightarrow D^{*+} X_0(2900)\), and\(B^+ \rightarrow D^{*+}\tilde{X}_{1,2}\)are investigated, and we find that the fit fraction of\(\tilde{X}_1\)in the process\(B^+ \rightarrow D^{*+} D^{*-} K^+\)is about 6%, which should be accessible by the LHCb and Belle II Collaborations.
We study the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition due to the effects of one-loop radiative corrections of Yukawa couplings between the inflaton and a dark fermion in a non-supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model. We obtain a spectral index\(n_s\), and a tensor-to-scalar ratior, consistent with the current Planck data. Our findings show that the abundance of PBHs is correlated to the dark fermion mass\(m_N\)and peak in the GW spectrum. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire dark matter (DM) candidate of the universe or a fraction of it. Our predictions are consistent with any existing constraints of PBH from microlensing, BBN, CMB, etc. Moreover, the scenario is also testable via induced gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order scalar perturbations detectable in future observatories such as LISA and ET. For instance, with inflaton mass\(m \sim 2\times 10^{12}\)GeV,\(m_N \sim 5.4\times 10^{15}\)GeV, we obtain PBHs of around\(10^{-13}\, M_\odot \)mass that can explain the entire abundance of DM and predict GWs with amplitude\(\Omega _\textrm{GW}h^2\)\(\sim 10^{-9}\)with peak frequencyf\(\sim \)0.1 Hz in LISA. By explicitly estimating fine-tuning we show that the model has very mild tuning. We discuss successful reheating at the end of the inflationary phase via the conversion of the waterfall field into standard model (SM) particles. We also briefly speculate a scenario where the dark fermion can be a possible heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) which is responsible for generating the SM neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. The RHN can be produced due to waterfall field decay and its subsequent decay may also explain the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe via leptogenesis. We find the reheat temperature\(T_R\lesssim 5\times 10^9\)GeV that explains the matter-anti-matter asymmetry of the universe.
Flux tube solutions within non-Abelian SU(3) Proca theory with external sources are obtained. It is shown that such tubes have a longitudinal chromoelectric field possessing two components (nonlinear and gradient), as well as a transverse chromomagnetic field whose force lines create concentric circles with the center on the axis of the tube. The scenario of a possible relationship between non-Abelian Proca theory and quantum chromodynamics is considered. In such scenario: (a) the components of color fields have different behavior: those which are almost classical, and those which are purely quantum; (b) the second components create a gluon condensate that is a source of the field for the almost classical components of the Proca field; (c) Proca masses may appear as a result of an approximate description of the gluon condensate; (d) the question of gauge invariance is considered. It is shown that the results obtained are in good agreement with the results of lattice calculations. We make an assumption that an approximate description of a flux tube in quantum chromodynamics can be carried out using classical Proca equations but with a mandatory account of a gluon condensate.
In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the charged AdS Gauss–Bonnet black holes and their associations with the Lyapunov exponent. The chaotic features of the black holes and the isobaric heat capacity characterized by the Lyapunov exponent are studied to reveal the thermodynamic stability of the black hole phases. By considering both the timelike and null geodesics, we find that the relationship between the Lyapunov exponent and the Hawking temperature can accurately represent the features of the Small/Large phase transition and even the triple point. We also reveal the properties of the difference in the Lyapunov exponent as an order parameter. It is demonstrated that there is a negative correlation between the Lyapunov exponent and the size of the black hole shadow, which can be used to bridge the thermodynamic properties and the shadow of black holes.
A well-known problem in cosmology is the ‘Hubble tension’ problem, i.e. different estimates for the Hubble constant\(H_0\)are not concordant with each other. This work investigates different statistical methods for estimating this value using cosmic chronometer, type Ia supernova and baryonic acoustic data. We start by making use of methods already established in the literature for this purpose, namely Gaussian process regression and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods based on the concordance\(\varLambda \)CDM model. We also consider two novel approaches; the first makes use of non-parametric MCMC inference on the hyperparameters of a Gaussian process kernel, independently of any cosmological model. The second approach is Student’st-process regression, which is a generalised version of Gaussian process regression that makes use of the multivariate Student’st-distribution instead of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. We also consider variants of these two methods which account for heteroscedasticity within the data. A comparison of the different approaches is made. In particular, the model-independent techniques investigated mostly agree with predictions based on the\(\varLambda \)CDM model. Moreover, Gaussian process regression is highly sensitive to the prior specification, while Student’st-process regression and the heteroscedastic variants of both methods are more robust to this. Student’st-process regression and both heteroscedastic models suggest a lower value of the Hubble constant. Across all the estimates obtained for the Hubble constant within this work, the median value is\(\hat{H}_0^{med} = 68.85 \pm 1.67\)km s\(^{-1}\)Mpc\(^{-1}\).
In this paper, we investigate the optical appearance of a regular static spherically symmetric hairy black hole within the context of Minkowski deformation governed by the parameter\(\alpha \). This black hole describes a hairy black hole with geometric deformations in the radial and temporal metric components, parameterized by\(\alpha \). The optical appearance of the black hole, illuminated by a static thin accretion disk in three toy emission function models, exhibits distinctive shadows and photon rings. Our findings reveal that for static spherically symmetric hairy Minkowski-deformed regular black holes, the event horizon radius\(r_h\), photon sphere radius\(r_{ph}\), critical impact parameter\(b_{ph}\), and innermost stable circular orbit radius\(r_{isco}\)all have a positive correlation with\(\alpha \). These parameters affect the null geodesic trajectories, shadows, and the optical appearance of the photon rings illuminated by a static thin accretion disk around the black hole. Utilizing this, we obtained the optical appearance of this black hole when observed in the forward direction of the optical and geometric thin accretion disk models. In all three models, the radius of the photon ring images also shows a positive correlation with the parameter\(\alpha \). Therefore, under the static spherically symmetric hairy Minkowski-deformed regular black hole, there is no degeneracy of photon rings dependent on the parameter\(\alpha \). Theoretically, this allows for the distinction of different spacetime metrics of hairy Minkowski-deformed regular black holes, providing a potential method for testing the no-hair theorem through future observations of black hole photon rings.
The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) may play a crucial role in enabling a scalar field to climb over high potential barriers, potentially significant in the very early universe. We propose a single-field model where the universe sequentially undergoes a first stage of slow-roll inflation, NEC violation, and a second stage of slow-roll inflation. Through the NEC violation, the scalar field climbs over high potential barriers, leaving unique characteristics on the primordial gravitational wave power spectrum, including a blue-tilted nature in the middle-frequency range and diminishing oscillation amplitudes at higher frequencies. Additionally, the power spectrum exhibits nearly scale-invariant behavior on both large and small scales.
Perturbative calculations predict that the effective potential of the Standard Model should have a new minimum, well beyond the Planck scale, which is much deeper than the electroweak vacuum. So far, most authors have accepted the metastability scenario in a cosmological perspective which is needed to explain why the theory remains trapped in our electroweak vacuum but requires to control the properties of matter in the extreme conditions of the early universe. As an alternative, one can consider the completely different idea of a non-perturbative effective potential that, as at the beginning of the Standard Model, is restricted to the pure\(\Phi ^4\)sector but is consistent with the indications of the now existing analytical and numerical studies, namely “triviality” and a description of SSB as weak first-order phase transition. In this approach, the electroweak vacuum is now the lowest energy state because, besides the state with mass\(m_h=125\)GeV, defined by the quadratic shape of the potential at its minimum, there is a second much larger mass scale\((M_H)^\textrm{Theor} \sim 690(30)\)GeV associated with the zero-point energy determining the potential depth. Despite its large mass, the heavier state would couple to longitudinalWs with the same typical strength as the low-mass state at 125 GeV and thus represent a relatively narrow resonance mainly produced at LHC by gluon-gluon fusion. Therefore, it is interesting that, in the LHC data, one can find combined indications of a new resonance of mass\((M_H)^\textrm{comb} \sim 685 (10)\)GeV, with a statistical significance which is far from negligible. Since this non-negligible evidence could become an important new discovery with forthcoming data, we outline further refinements of the theoretical predictions, that could be obtained by implementing unitarity constraints, in the presence of fermion and gauge fields, with the type of coupled-channel calculations nowadays used in meson spectroscopy.
This work explores the construction of spherically symmetric models of stellar interiors by incorporating the null complexity factor (CF) as an additional constraint. This supplementary condition helps us to close an array of stellar structure equations resulting from the process of gravitational decoupling. By making use of MGD-type gravitational decoupling we analyze the role of gravitational decoupling and its impact on the complexity of static, self-gravitational systems. We begin by considering an anisotropic seed solution described by the Kohler–Chao–Tikekar metric ansatz. We then apply the minimal geometric deformation technique to this seed solution, imposing the constraint that the effective anisotropic factor vanishes. This constraint leads to the generation of an isotropic stellar solution. Furthermore, we construct a second family of solutions in which the CF, remains the same for both the seed solution and its minimally deformed counterpart. Our analysis further investigated the influence of both the deformation parameter and the CF on the structural properties of the static and spherically symmetric stellar objects.
In this work, we consider intermediate inflation in the context of the generalized non-minimal derivative coupling (GNMDC) model. In the GNMDC model, inflation is driven by a canonical scalar field that is coupled not only to gravity but also to the derivative of the scalar field. The model introduces new dynamics and features during the inflationary epoch. We find inflationary solutions with a power law scalar field for the power law coupling function. Additionally, we determine the inflaton potential that generates intermediate expansion of the scale factor. We also discuss the background equations in the high friction limit and derive constraints on the parameters of our model. Furthermore, we investigate the cosmological perturbations in the slow roll approximation within the GNMDC model, and we calculate the scalar and tensor spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio during intermediate inflation. We compare the results of this model with observational data that can be used to test the model using cosmic microwave background radiation data. Overall, we establish conditions for the inflaton potential that ensure the continuation of accelerated expansion during slow roll inflation. We numerically analyze the power spectrum and spectral index for scalar and tensor modes in intermediate inflation in the high friction limit, and we use Planck 2018 data to obtain constraints on the parameters of the model. We demonstrate that intermediate inflation in the GNMDC model is successful in evaluation and explanation of background and perturbation quantities using observational data.
In recent years, neural network-based classification has been used to improve data analysis at collider experiments. While this strategy proves to be hugely successful, the underlying models are not commonly shared with the public and rely on experiment-internal data as well as full detector simulations. We show a concrete implementation of a newly proposed strategy, so-called Classifier Surrogates, to be trained inside the experiments, that only utilise publicly accessible features and truth information. These surrogates approximate the original classifier distribution, and can be shared with the public. Subsequently, such a model can be evaluated by sampling the classification output from high-level information without requiring a sophisticated detector simulation. Technically, we show that continuous normalizing flows are a suitable generative architecture that can be efficiently trained to sample classification results using conditional flow matching. We further demonstrate that these models can be easily extended by Bayesian uncertainties to indicate their degree of validity when confronted with unknown inputs by the user. For a concrete example of tagging jets from hadronically decaying top quarks, we demonstrate the application of flows in combination with uncertainty estimation through either inference of a mean-field Gaussian weight posterior, or Monte Carlo sampling network weights.
Photodetectors used in future high-energy physics experiments will need to keep sufficient performance during a few years of data-taking despite radiation load, which, for example, in the planned upgrade of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detectors in Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment is estimated at about 10\(^{13}\)1-MeV neutron equivalent per cm\(^{2}\)(neq/cm\(^{2}\)). Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are considered as candidates for photodetectors for this application. However, their sensitivity to neutron irradiation may seriously compromise their operation, with the increase in dark count rates being the primary limitation after the irradiation. In this work, 1\(\times \)1 mm\(^{2}\)15\(\mu \)m pitch NUV-HD-RH silicon photomultipliers developed by the Fondazione Bruno Kessler were characterized before and after the irradiation. In total, 5 SiPMs were irradiated at the Jožef Stefan Institute TRIGA nuclear reactor with different fluences from 10\(^{9}\)neq/cm\(^{2}\)up to 10\(^{13}\)neq/cm\(^{2}\). The SiPMs were also annealed at high temperatures and re-characterized after the annealing. For the SiPM characterization in all the cases, current–voltage (I-V curve) measurements, dark count rate measurements, and waveform analysis, including single photon time resolution, were carried out at different controlled temperature steps from room temperature down to the liquid nitrogen temperature. While cooling to − 20\(^{\circ }\)C was enough for the SiPM irradiated at 10\(^{9}\)neq/cm\(^{2}\)to recover the ability to resolve single photons, by 10\(^{13}\)neq/cm\(^{2}\), cooling to liquid nitrogen temperature was necessary. With sufficient cooling, the measured single photon time resolution was around 90 ps FWHM for all irradiation levels.
This paper presents a measurement of the production cross-section of aZboson in association withb- orc-jets, in proton–proton collisions at\(\sqrt{s} = 13\)TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140\(\hbox {fb}^{-1}\). Inclusive and differential cross-sections are measured for events containing aZboson decaying into electrons or muons and produced in association with at least oneb-jet, at least onec-jet, or at least twob-jets with transverse momentum\(p_\text {T} > 20\)GeV and rapidity\(|y| < 2.5\). Predictions from several Monte Carlo generators based on next-to-leading-order matrix elements interfaced with a parton-shower simulation, with different choices of flavour schemes for initial-state partons, are compared with the measured cross-sections. The results are also compared with novel predictions, based on infrared and collinear safe jet flavour dressing algorithms. Selected\(Z + \ge 1~c\)-jet observables, optimized for sensitivity to intrinsic-charm, are compared with benchmark models with different intrinsic-charm fractions.
Gauge-invariant quantum fields are constructed in an Abelian power-counting renormalizable gauge theory with both scalar, vector and fermionic matter content. This extends previous results already obtained for the gauge-invariant description of the Higgs mode via a propagating gauge-invariant field. The renormalization of the model is studied in the Algebraic Renormalization approach. The decomposition of Slavnov–Taylor identities into separately invariant sectors is analyzed. We also comment on some non-renormalizable extensions of the model whose 1-PI Green’s functions are the flows of certain differential equations of the homogeneous Euler type, exactly resumming the dependence on a certain set of dim. 6 and dim. 8 derivative operators. The latter are identified uniquely by the condition that they span the mass and kinetic terms in the gauge-invariant dynamical fields. The construction can be extended to non-Abelian gauge groups.
We study how the number of degrees of freedom in Weyl conformal gravity runs with the energy scale from the UV fixed point. To this end we employ two approaches. First, we utilize the Fradkin–Tseytlin prescription for the number of degrees of freedom and demonstrate that the one-loop result is highly dependent on the selected background. We then employ the counting methodology based on thea- andc-function, which are typically used to characterize the trace anomaly of conformal field theories in four dimensions. We compute these in the enhanced one-loop approximation and demonstrate that the degrees of freedom decrease monotonically from six degrees in the UV regime. This behavior is independent of the backgrounds considered. Further salient issues, such as the connection between the Fradkin–Tseytlin prescription and counting based on thea- andc-function, or the applicability of both methods in Einstein’s gravity, are also addressed.
This paper delves into the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe and the evolution of cosmic structures within the context of a specific\( f(R, L_m) \)gravity model, formulated as\( f(R, L_m) = \lambda R + \beta L_m^\alpha + \eta \). To study the cosmological viability of the model, we employed the latest cosmic measurement datasets: (i) 57 observational Hubble parameter data points (OHD); (ii) 1048 distance moduli data points (SNIa); (iii) a combined dataset (OHD+SNIa); and large scale structure datasets, including (iv) 14 growth rate data points (f); and (v) 30 redshift space distortion data points (f\(\sigma _8\)). These datasets facilitated the constraint of the\( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model via MCMC simulations, followed by a comparative analysis with the\(\varLambda \)CDM model. A comprehensive statistical analysis has been conducted to evaluate the\( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model’s efficacy in explaining both the accelerated expansion of the universe and the growth of cosmic structures. Using large-scale structure data, we find the best-fit values of\(\varOmega _m = 0.242^{+0.016}_{-0.032}\),\(\alpha = 1.15^{+0.20}_{-0.20}\),\(\beta = 1.12^{+0.13}_{-0.30}\),\(\lambda = 0.72^{+0.30}_{-0.13}\)and\(\gamma = 0.555\pm {0.014}\)usingf-data and\(\varOmega _m = 0.284^{+0.035}_{-0.049}\),\(\sigma _8 = 0.799^{+0.045}_{-0.086}\),\(\alpha = 0.766^{+0.026}_{-0.064}\),\(\beta = 1.08^{+0.40}_{-0.16}\), and\(\lambda = 0.279^{+0.078}_{-0.11}\)usingf\(\sigma _8\)-data at the\(1\sigma \)and\(2\sigma \)confidence levels, respectively, with the model showing substantial observational support based on\(\varDelta \)AIC values but less observational support based on the\(\varDelta \)BIC values on Jeffreys’ statistical criteria. On the other hand, from the joint analysis of theOHD+SNIadata, we obtain\(\alpha = 1.091^{+0.035}_{-0.042}\),\(\beta = 1.237^{+ 0.056}_{-0.16}\)and\(\lambda = 0.630^{+0.031}_{-0.050}\)with the Jeffreys’ scale statistical criteria showing the\( f(R, L_m) \)model having substantial support when usingOHDdata, less observational support with the joint analysisOHD+SNIa, and rejected usingSNIadata, compared with\(\varLambda \)CDM at the background level.
This study investigates the intricate relationship between dissipative processes of open quantum systems and the non-Hermitian quantum field theory of relativistic fermionic systems. By examining the influence of dissipative effects on Dirac fermions via Lindblad formalism, we elucidate the effects of coupling relativistic Dirac particles with the environment and show the lack of manifest Lorentz invariance. Employing rigorous theoretical analysis, we generalize the collisionless Boltzmann equations for the relativistic dissipation-driven fermionic system and find the Lyapunov equation, which governs the stationary solutions. Using our formalism, one presents a simple non-Hermitian model that the relativistic fermionic particles and anti-particles are stable. Going further, using the solution to the Lyapunov equations, one analyses the effect of dissipation on the stationary charge imbalance of this non-Hermitian model and finds that the dissipation can induce a new kind of charge imbalance compared with the collisionless equilibrium case.
In this work, we investigate the decays of mesonX(4160) in the molecular frame. By using an effective lagrangian approach, we calculate the widths of\(X(4160)\rightarrow J/\psi \phi \),\(D^*\bar{D}^*\),\(D^*\bar{D}\)and\(D\bar{D}\)through the triangle loop mechanism in the molecular scenario. Based on the compositeness condition, the coupling betweenX(4160) and the\(D_s^*\bar{D}_s^*\)molecular state is determined. The other coupling constants used are determined phenomenologically. The calculation of the decay widths shows that the\(D^*\bar{D}^*\)decay mode has a larger branching ratio. These predictions can be seen as a test for the charmonium assignment ofX(4160).
We derive novel black hole solutions in a modified gravity theory, namely the Hu–Sawicki model off(R) gravity. After obtaining the black hole solution, we study the horizon radius of the black hole from the metric and then analyse the dependence of the model parameters on the horizon. We then use the 6th order WKB method to study the quasinormal modes of oscillations (QNMs) of the black hole perturbed by a scalar field. The dependence of the amplitude and damping part of the QNMs are analysed with respect to variations in model parameters and the error associated with the QNMs are also computed. After that we study some thermodynamic properties associated with the black hole such as its thermodynamic temperature as well as greybody factors. It is found that the black hole has the possibility of showcasing negative temperatures and is thermodynamically unstable for feasible values of model parameters. Then we analyse the geodesics and derive the photon sphere radius as well as the shadow radius of the black hole. The photon radius is independent of the model parameters while shadow radius showed fair amount of dependence on the model parameters. We tried to constrain the parameters with the help of Keck and VLTI observational data and obtained some bounds onmand\(c_{2}\)parameters.
We point out that the area of event horizon of Kleinian black hole is infinite due to the fact that its event horizon is not a sphere but a hyperboloid. Therefore, the usual interpretations of Schwarzschild black hole might not be applicable to the Kleinian black hole.
We consider the third law of thermodynamics for families of 4- and n-dimensional Vaidya black holes, including many of interest. Since there are several versions of the definition of surface gravity as well as the extremality condition for dynamical black holes, we first show that for the considered 4- and n-dimensional Vaidya families, these definitions are consistent with each other. We assume, first, that a non-extremal black hole evolves to an extremality state after a finite time and second, that the weak energy condition for the source holds at all times. We then compare the results of these assumptions and investigate whether there are ranges of black hole parameters where these two assumptions are in conflict.
This work revisits a modified version of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation in the presence of pressure anisotropy based on General Relativity with an extra dimension. We examine the structural features of quark stars in various dimensions by solving the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) equation numerically using the interacting quark EoS. From our result, the compact star model with isotropic pressure can be obtained as\(\alpha \)approaches zero. The energy-dependent maximum mass and its associated radius, as well as the other characteristics like pressure, energy density, stability, etc., of the quark star, are obtained using the numerical solution. Through our detailed study, we have demonstrated that the conclusions we obtained here are consistent with observable evidence in four-dimensional spacetime. In four dimensions, for different values of\(\alpha \), our obtained results can predict the mass of the compact stars PSR J0740+6620, PSR J1614-2230, Vela X-1, 4U 1608-52, 4U 1820-30, Cen X-3, and EXO 1785-248.
The quantum-corrected black hole model demonstrates significant potential in the study of gravitational lensing effects. By incorporating quantum effects, this model addresses the singularity problem in classical black holes. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the quantum correction parameter on the lensing effect based on the quantum-corrected black hole model. Using the black holes\(M87^*\)and\(Sgr A^*\)as our subjects, we explore the influence of the quantum correction parameter on angular position, Einstein ring, and time delay. Additionally, we use data from the Event Horizon Telescope observations of black hole shadows to constrain the quantum correction parameter. Our results indicate that the quantum correction parameter significantly affects the lensing coefficients\(\bar{a}\)and\(\bar{b}\), as well as the Einstein ring. The position\(\theta _{\infty }\)and brightness ratioSof the relativistic image exhibit significant changes,with deviations on the order of magnitude of\(\sim 1\,\upmu \! \textrm{as}\)and\(\sim 0.01\,\upmu \! \textrm{as}\), respectively. The impact of the quantum correction parameter on the time delay\(\Delta T_{21}\)is particularly significant in the\(M87^*\)black hole, with deviations reaching up to several tens of hours. Using observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope(EHT) of black hole shadows to constrain the quantum correction parameter, the constraint range under the\(M87^*\)black hole is\(0\le \frac{\alpha }{M^2}\le 1.4087\)and the constraint range under the\(Sgr A^*\)black hole is\(0.9713\le \frac{\alpha }{M^2}\le 1.6715\). Although the current resolution of the EHT limits the observation of subtle differences, future high-resolution telescopes are expected to further distinguish between the quantum-corrected black hole and the Schwarzschild black hole, providing new avenues for exploring quantum gravitational effects.
We study self-gravitating solutions of three-dimensional massive gravity coupled to the Yang–Mills–Chern–Simons gauge theory. Among these, there is a family of asymptotically Warped-Anti de Sitter black holes that come to generalize previous solutions found in the literature and studied in the context of WAdS\(_3\)/CFT\(_2\). We also present self-gravitating solutions to three-dimensional Einstein–Yang–Mills theory, as well other self-gravitating solutions in the presence of higher-curvature terms.
We point out that the area of event horizon of Kleinian black hole is infinite due to the fact that its event horizon is not a sphere but a hyperboloid. Therefore, the usual interpretations of Schwarzschild black hole might not be applicable to the Kleinian black hole.
Gauge-invariant quantum fields are constructed in an Abelian power-counting renormalizable gauge theory with both scalar, vector and fermionic matter content. This extends previous results already obtained for the gauge-invariant description of the Higgs mode via a propagating gauge-invariant field. The renormalization of the model is studied in the Algebraic Renormalization approach. The decomposition of Slavnov–Taylor identities into separately invariant sectors is analyzed. We also comment on some non-renormalizable extensions of the model whose 1-PI Green’s functions are the flows of certain differential equations of the homogeneous Euler type, exactly resumming the dependence on a certain set of dim. 6 and dim. 8 derivative operators. The latter are identified uniquely by the condition that they span the mass and kinetic terms in the gauge-invariant dynamical fields. The construction can be extended to non-Abelian gauge groups.
We study how the number of degrees of freedom in Weyl conformal gravity runs with the energy scale from the UV fixed point. To this end we employ two approaches. First, we utilize the Fradkin–Tseytlin prescription for the number of degrees of freedom and demonstrate that the one-loop result is highly dependent on the selected background. We then employ the counting methodology based on thea- andc-function, which are typically used to characterize the trace anomaly of conformal field theories in four dimensions. We compute these in the enhanced one-loop approximation and demonstrate that the degrees of freedom decrease monotonically from six degrees in the UV regime. This behavior is independent of the backgrounds considered. Further salient issues, such as the connection between the Fradkin–Tseytlin prescription and counting based on thea- andc-function, or the applicability of both methods in Einstein’s gravity, are also addressed.
This paper delves into the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe and the evolution of cosmic structures within the context of a specific\( f(R, L_m) \)gravity model, formulated as\( f(R, L_m) = \lambda R + \beta L_m^\alpha + \eta \). To study the cosmological viability of the model, we employed the latest cosmic measurement datasets: (i) 57 observational Hubble parameter data points (OHD); (ii) 1048 distance moduli data points (SNIa); (iii) a combined dataset (OHD+SNIa); and large scale structure datasets, including (iv) 14 growth rate data points (f); and (v) 30 redshift space distortion data points (f\(\sigma _8\)). These datasets facilitated the constraint of the\( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model via MCMC simulations, followed by a comparative analysis with the\(\varLambda \)CDM model. A comprehensive statistical analysis has been conducted to evaluate the\( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model’s efficacy in explaining both the accelerated expansion of the universe and the growth of cosmic structures. Using large-scale structure data, we find the best-fit values of\(\varOmega _m = 0.242^{+0.016}_{-0.032}\),\(\alpha = 1.15^{+0.20}_{-0.20}\),\(\beta = 1.12^{+0.13}_{-0.30}\),\(\lambda = 0.72^{+0.30}_{-0.13}\)and\(\gamma = 0.555\pm {0.014}\)usingf-data and\(\varOmega _m = 0.284^{+0.035}_{-0.049}\),\(\sigma _8 = 0.799^{+0.045}_{-0.086}\),\(\alpha = 0.766^{+0.026}_{-0.064}\),\(\beta = 1.08^{+0.40}_{-0.16}\), and\(\lambda = 0.279^{+0.078}_{-0.11}\)usingf\(\sigma _8\)-data at the\(1\sigma \)and\(2\sigma \)confidence levels, respectively, with the model showing substantial observational support based on\(\varDelta \)AIC values but less observational support based on the\(\varDelta \)BIC values on Jeffreys’ statistical criteria. On the other hand, from the joint analysis of theOHD+SNIadata, we obtain\(\alpha = 1.091^{+0.035}_{-0.042}\),\(\beta = 1.237^{+ 0.056}_{-0.16}\)and\(\lambda = 0.630^{+0.031}_{-0.050}\)with the Jeffreys’ scale statistical criteria showing the\( f(R, L_m) \)model having substantial support when usingOHDdata, less observational support with the joint analysisOHD+SNIa, and rejected usingSNIadata, compared with\(\varLambda \)CDM at the background level.
In this work, we present a search strategy for heavy charged Higgs boson at compact linear collider (CLIC) as a future\(e^+e^-\)collider. The signal is charged Higgs boson pair production in two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) followed by\(H^{\pm }\rightarrow W^{\pm }H\)and\(H\rightarrow b\bar{b}\). Here,Hdenotes the heavy CP-even neutral Higgs boson of the model. The collider center of mass energy is chosen to be\(\sqrt{s}=1400\)GeV as the second stage of CLIC operation. In this case,\(m_{H^+}<\sqrt{s}/2\)can be explored due to the pair production. It is shown that the signal of charged Higgs in the mass range\(250~ \text {GeV}<m_{H^+}< 650~ \text {GeV}\)in fully hadronic final state, containing fourb-jets from neutral Higgs and four jets fromWbosons, can well be observed on top of the standard model background. Finally\(5\sigma \)contours are presented in\((m_{H^{\pm }},m_{H})\)space for different\(\tan \beta \)values.

The CMS detector, including its muon system, has been operating at the CERN LHC in increasingly challenging conditions for about 15 years. The muon detector was designed to provide excellent triggering and track reconstruction for muons produced in proton–proton collisons at an instantaneous luminosity (\(\mathcal {L}\)) of\(1 \times 10^{34}\)cm\(^{-2}\)s\(^{-1}\). During the Run 2 data-taking period (2015–2018), the LHC achieved an instantaneous luminosity of twice its design value, resulting in larger background rates and making the efficient detection of muons more difficult. While some backgrounds result from natural radioactivity, cosmic rays, and interactions of the circulating protons with residual gas in the beam pipe, the dominant source of background hits in the muon system arises from proton–proton interactions themselves. Charged hadrons leaving the calorimeters produce energy deposits in the muon chambers. In addition, high-energy particles interacting in the hadron calorimeter and forward shielding elements generate thermal neutrons, which leak out of the calorimeter and shielding structures, filling the CMS cavern. We describe the method used to measure the background rates in the various muon subsystems. These rates, in conjunction with simulations, can be used to estimate the expected backgrounds in the High-Luminosity LHC. This machine will run for at least 10 years starting in 2029 reaching an instantaneous luminosity of\(\mathcal {L} = 5 \times \text {10}^\text {34}\,\text {cm}^\text {-2}\,\text {s}^\text {-1}\)and increasing ultimately to\(\mathcal {L} = 7.5 \times \text {10}^\text {34}\,\text {cm}^\text {-2}\,\text {s}^\text {-1}\). These background estimates have been a key ingredient for the planning and design of the muon detector upgrade.
The structure in the Universe is believed to have evolved from quantum fluctuations seeded by inflation in the early Universe. These fluctuations lead to density perturbations that grow via gravitational instability into large cosmological structures. In the linear regime, the growth of a structure is directly coupled to the velocity field because perturbations are amplified by attracting (and accelerating) matter. Surveys of galaxy redshifts and distances allow one to infer the underlying density and velocity fields. Here, assuming the lambda cold dark matter standard model of cosmology and applying a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to the grouped Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) compilation of 38,000 groups of galaxies, the large-scale structure of the Universe is reconstructed out to a redshift corresponding to ~30,000 km s−1. Our method provides a probabilistic assessment of the domains of gravitational potential minima: basins of attraction (BoA). Earlier Cosmicflows catalogues suggested that the Milky Way Galaxy was associated with a BoA called Laniakea. With the newer CF4 data, there is a slight probabilistic preference for Laniakea to be part of the much larger Shapley BoA. The largest BoA recovered from the CF4 data is associated with the Sloan Great Wall, with a volume within the sample of 15.5 × 106(h−1Mpc)3, which is more than twice the size of the second largest Shapley BoA.
It has been theorized that terrestrial planets born beyond 1–3 au could avoid being engulfed during the red-giant phases of their host stars. Nevertheless, only a few gas-giant planets have been observed around white dwarfs (WDs), the end product left behind by a red giant. Here we report on evidence that the lens system that produced the microlensing event KMT-2020-BLG-0414 is composed of a WD orbited by an Earth-mass planet and a brown dwarf companion, as shown by the non-detection of the lens flux using Keck adaptive optics. From microlensing orbital motion constraints, we determine the planet to be a 1.9 ± 0.2 Earth-mass (M⊕) planet at a physical separation of 2.1 ± 0.2 au from the WD during the event. By considering the system’s evolutionary history, we determine the brown dwarf companion to have a projected separation of 22 au from the WD and reject a degenerate model that places the brown dwarf at 0.2 au. Given the planetary orbital expansion during the final evolutionary stages of the host star, this Earth-mass planet may have existed in an initial orbit close to 1 au, thereby offering a glimpse into the possible survival of planet Earth in the distant future.
The Japanese Hayabusa2 spacecraft returned samples from the asteroid Ryugu in December 2020, and several results on the properties of the particles have been published since. A detailed geochemical analysis determined that the total organic carbon abundance of the sample was on average 2.92 wt%. This value is much less than the 14.6–59.3 vol% estimated from remote-sensing data for Ryugu coupled with the albedos of irradiated meteorites and organic matter. Understanding the reasons for this discrepancy is paramount to accurately predict the composition of C-complex asteroids. Here we explore several factors that may affect the estimates of organic matter abundance made using remote-sensing data. Such factors include the distribution of organic matter, the porosity and roughness of the surfaces of asteroids, and inconsistencies between the observation geometries used by remote-sensing and laboratory investigations. We posit that discussing such factors may fuel further experimental investigations of the effects of irradiation on asteroid surfaces and, thus, improve predictions of their organic composition.
Hydrated asteroids are likely to be main source of water for the terrestrial planets. The controls on the extent of asteroid hydration, however, are poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of multiple fracture and vein sets in a sample from the C-type asteroid 162173 Ryugu that acted as pathways for the migration of distal fluids during its aqueous alteration. Early veins in Ryugu are decorated with framboidal magnetite, while later veins caused metasomatism of wall rocks. Both veins and fractures have cuspate geometries and complex intersecting geometries consistent with freeze–thaw fractures formed during experiments. We show that freeze–thaw is effective in fracturing C-type asteroids to up to 300 km in diameter and is thus crucial in the outwards migration of fluids in ice-bearing asteroids. Freeze–thaw is likely, therefore, to determine the distribution of mineral-hosted water in asteroids throughout the Cosmos.
Parent bodies of C-type asteroids may have brought key volatile and organic-rich compounds to the terrestrial planets in the early stages of the Solar System. At the end of 2020, the JAXA Hayabusa2 mission successfully returned samples from Ryugu, providing access to a primitive matter that has not suffered terrestrial alteration. Here we report the discovery of a peculiar class of grains, up to a few hundreds of micrometres in size, that have a hydrated ammonium–magnesium–phosphorus (HAMP)-rich composition. Their specific chemical and physical properties point towards an origin in the outer Solar System, beyond most snow lines, and their preservation along Ryugu history. These phosphorus-rich grains, embedded within an organic-rich phyllosilicate matrix, may have played a major role when immersed in primitive terrestrial water reservoirs. In particular, in contrast to poorly soluble calcium-rich phosphates, HAMP grains favour the release of phosphorus-rich and nitrogen-rich ionic species, to enter chemical reactions. HAMP grains may have thus critically contributed to the reaction pathways of organic matter towards a biochemical evolution.
We study the chaotic dynamics of spinless extended bodies in a wide class of spherically symmetric spacetimes, which encompasses black-hole scenarios in many modified theories of gravity. We show that a spherically symmetric pulsating ball may have chaotic motion in this class of spacetimes. The cases of the Reissner–Nordström and Ayón-Beato–García black holes are analyzed in detail. The equations of motion for the extended bodies are obtained according to Dixon’s formalism, up to quadrupole order. Then, we use Melnikov’s method to show the presence of homoclinic intersections, which imply chaotic behavior, as a consequence of our assumption that the test body has an oscillating radius.
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients whose origins remain unknown. As the vast majority of bursts are one-off events, it is necessary to pinpoint FRBs precisely within their host galaxies at the time of detection. Here we use two purpose-built outrigger telescopes to localize FRB 20210603A at the time of its detection by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). Our very-long-baseline interferometry stations localized the burst to a 0.2" × 2" final ellipse in the disk of its host galaxy SDSS J004105.82+211331.9. A spatially resolved spectroscopic follow-up revealed recent star formation (Hα emission) on kiloparsec scales near the burst position. The excess dispersion measure is consistent with expectations from the nearly edge-on disk of the host galaxy, demonstrating the utility of FRBs as probes of the interstellar medium in distant galaxies. The excess dispersion measure, rotation measure and scattering are consistent with expectations for a pulse travelling from deep within its host galactic plane, strengthening the link between the local environment of FRB 20210603A and the disk of its host galaxy. Finally, this technique demonstrates a way to overcome the trade-off between angular resolution and field of view in FRB instrumentation, paving the way towards plentiful and precise FRB localizations.
The atmospheric properties of hot exoplanets are expected to be different between the morning and the evening limbs due to their global atmospheric circulation. Ground-based observations at high spectral resolution have detected this limb asymmetry in several ultra-hot (>2,000 K) exoplanets, but the prevalence of the phenomenon in the broader exoplanetary population remains unexplored. Here we use JWST/NIRCam transmission spectra between 2.5 and 4.0 μm to find evidence of limb asymmetry on exoplanet WASP-107 b. With its equilibrium temperature of 770 K and low density of 0.126 g cm−3, WASP-107 b probes a very different regime compared to ultra-hot giant planets and was not expected to exhibit substantial spatial heterogeneity according to atmospheric models. We infer instead a morning-to-evening temperature difference of the order of 100 K with a hotter evening limb. Further observations of other cooler exoplanets are needed to determine whether WASP-107 b is an outlier or whether the models have underestimated the presence of limb asymmetry in exoplanets.
Recently, it was shown that type D black holes, encompassed in the large Plebanśki–Demiański (PD) family, exhibit a wide class of algebraically general generalizations via the application of Ehlers and Harrison transformations. In this work, we first discuss some mathematical details behind the composition of such transformations, and next, we introduce a qualitative picture of the most general type I generalization of the PD family, dubbed “Enhanced Plebanśki–Demiański” spacetime. We provide the exact form of the solution in the original PD coordinates, obtained via the simultaneous action of an Ehlers and a Harrison transformation on the vacuum PD geometry. In order to make the physics more transparent, we explicitly construct a rotating and accelerating black hole which further has NUT parameter and electric charges, both of them entering, not only the event horizon, but the Rindler horizon as well. This solution is directly obtained in the “physical” coordinates recently proposed by Podolský and Vrátny. Finally, a pedagogical appendix is thoughtfully included, providing readers with a user-friendly step-by-step guide to the Ernst formalism, in an attempt to address and resolve various minor inconsistencies frequently appearing in the relevant literature.
Boltzmann’s work, “Ueber die sogenannteH-Curve,” discusses his demonstration of the essential characteristics of theH-curve in a clear, concise, and precise style, showcasing his efforts to persuade his peers. To make these findings more widely accessible, the author aims to provide a translated version of the original article, while also correcting some typographical errors in the mathematical expressions with explanatory footnotes. The final section offers concluding remarks with graphs and relevant references for interested readers.
We consider dynamics of a scalar field in compactification scenario of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology. It is shown that if the field is non-minimally coupled to curvature, its asymptotic value under certain conditions may be shifted from the minimum of its potential. This means that due to influence of extra dimensions a scalar field with\(\lambda \phi ^4\)potential can stabilise away from\(\phi =0\)stable point which means an effective symmetry breaking occurs in such a system.
Magnetic halos of galaxies are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, galactic-scale outflows and feedback from star formation activity. Identifying the magnetized halo of the Milky Way is challenging because of the potential contamination from foreground emission arising in local spiral arms. In addition, it is unclear how our magnetic halo is influenced by recently revealed large-scale structures such as the X-ray-emitting eROSITA Bubbles detected by the extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA). Here we report the identification of several kiloparsec-scale magnetized structures on the basis of their polarized radio emission and their gamma-ray counterparts, which can be interpreted as the radiation of relativistic electrons in the Galactic magnetic halo. These non-thermal structures extend far above and below the Galactic plane and are spatially coincident with the thermal X-ray emission from the eROSITA Bubbles. The morphological consistency of these structures suggests a common origin, which can be sustained by Galactic outflows driven by active star-forming regions located in the Galactic Disk at 3–5 kpc from the Galactic Centre. These results reveal how X-ray-emitting and magnetized halos of spiral galaxies can be related to intense star formation activities and suggest that the X-shaped coherent magnetic structures observed in their halos can stem from galactic outflows.
We show generically that the dynamics of a probe particle near the event horizon of a non-extreme black hole is described by the tachyon effective action. The Hagedorn temperature in the action is always equal to the Hawking temperature of the background black hole. The fact suggests that the infalling particle should decay completely into gravitons or closed strings approaching the event horizon. The increased area in the black hole due to absorption of a particle should be interpreted as the entropy of degenerate states of the closed strings that the particle decays into. With the energy match condition between the infalling particle and the emitted closed strings on the event horizon, we examine this variational area-entropy relation and find that it matches in all cases if the closed string emission process from an unstable D0-brane obeys the first law.
Many new physics models include secluded sectors that interact little with the Standard Model and whose internal interactions control the dark matter abundance. If these same interactions are responsible for maintaining kinematic equilibrium within the secluded sector, it is possible that the phase-space distributions will differ considerably from their thermal values during freeze-out. This can potentially result in deviations of the dark matter abundance from that computed under the assumption of thermal distributions. In this paper, we revisit dark matter abundance computations for a benchmark secluded sector by numerically tracking the phase-space distributions. Namely, we show that the dark matter abundance can deviate considerably from standard results during the freeze-out process, but that a longer period of annihilation ultimately leaves only a slight excess.
The six-derivative conformal scalar operator was originally found by Hamada in its critical dimension of spacetime,\(d=6\). We generalize this construction to arbitrary dimensionsdby adding new terms cubic in gravitational curvatures and by changing its coefficients of expansion in various curvature terms. The consequences of global scale-invariance and of infinitesimal local conformal transformations are derived for the form of this generalized operator. The system of linear equations for coefficients is solved giving explicitly the conformal Hamada operator in anyd. Some singularities in construction for dimensions\(d=2\)and\(d=4\)are noticed. We also prove a general theorem that a scalar conformal operator withnderivatives in\(d=n-2\)dimensions is impossible to construct. Finally, we compare our explicit construction with the one that uses conformal covariant derivatives and conformal curvature tensors. We present new results for operators built with different orders of conformal covariant derivatives.
We propose the reaction\(\psi (3686) \rightarrow \bar{\Xi }^+ \bar{K}^0 \Sigma ^{*-}\), with the\(\Sigma ^{*-}\)decaying to\(\pi ^- \Lambda \)in order to show evidence for the existence of two\(\Xi (1820)\)states, one around 1824 MeV and narrow, and another one around 1875 MeV and wide. The phase space for\(\bar{K}^0 \Sigma ^{*-}\)production reduces the effect of the lower mass resonance, magnifying the effect of the higher mass resonance that shows clearly over the phase space. The estimated rate of the production is bigger than the one of the\(\psi (3686) \rightarrow \bar{\Xi }^+ K^- \Lambda \)reaction, where a clear peak for\(\Xi (1820)\)was observed by the BESIII collaboration, what makes the Beijing facility ideal to carry out the reaction proposed.
This paper examines distinct ensembles such as canonical, mixed, and grand canonical ensembles of recently postulated black hole which is considered to be an ideal solution of metric-affine gravity utilizing the Duan’s\(\phi \)-mapping theory. In the scenario, charged and uncharged topological characteristics associated to thermodynamic stability criteria are explored. In contrast to the canonical ensemble, which is always possesses the constant electric and magnetic charges, but mixed ensemble possesses the constant potentials (both magnetic and electric). Also, grand canonical ensemble maintains the constant electric and magnetic potentials for both charges. Initially, we find the topological classes connected via critical points in all of the aforementioned ensembles.
Isospin symmetry, as the most precise flavor symmetry, can be used to extract information about hadronic dynamics. The effective Hamiltonian for bottom quark weak decay is zero under the isospin lowering operators\(I_-^n\), which allows us to generate isospin sum rules through several master formulas. In this work, we derive the master formulas of isospin sum rules for the two- and three-body non-leptonic decays ofBmesons. Numerous new isospin sum rules, especially those involving three or more decay channels, are proposed. The isospin sum rules can be used to test isospin symmetry and provide hints the isospin partners of exotic hadrons inBdecays. It is found ten percent isospin breaking only in decay modes involving two vector mesons, indicating the complex dynamics of vector mesons. Besides, the isospin analysis suggests the charm tetraquark resonances might be observed in the\( B^- \rightarrow J/\Psi \pi ^-\overline{K}^0\),\(\overline{B}^0 \rightarrow J/\Psi \overline{K}^0\phi \), and\(\overline{B}^0\rightarrow D^0\overline{D}^0\overline{K}^0\)modes.
In the Lounesto classification, there are three types of regular spinors. They are classified by the condition that at least one of the scalar or pseudo scalar norms are non-vanishing. The Dirac spinors are regular spinors because their scalar and pseudo scalar norms are non-zero and zero respectively. We construct local and Lorentz-covariant fermionic fields from all three classes of regular spinors. By computing the invariants and bilinear covariants of the regular spinor fields, we show that they are physically equivalent to the Dirac fields in the sense that whatever interactions one writes down using the regular spinor fields, they can always be expressed in terms of the Dirac fields.
We show that there is a phenomenologically and theoretically consistent limit of the generic Einstein-Aether theory in which the Einstein-Aether field equations reduce to Einstein field equations with a perfect fluid distribution sourced by the aether field. This limit is obtained by taking three of the coupling constants of the theory to be zero but keeping the expansion coupling constant to be nonzero. We then consider the further reduction of this limited version of Einstein-Aether theory by taking the expansion of the aether field to be constant (possibly zero), and thereby we introduce the Minimal Einstein-Aether theory that supports the Einstein metrics as solutions with a reduced cosmological constant. The square of the expansion of the unit-timelike aether field shifts the bare cosmological constant and thus provides, via local Lorentz symmetry breaking inherent in the Einstein-Aether theories, a novel mechanism for reconciling the observed, small cosmological constant (or dark energy) with the large theoretical prediction coming from quantum field theories. The crucial point here is that minimal Einstein-Aether theory does not modify the well-tested aspects of General Relativity such as solar system tests and black hole physics including gravitational waves.
This article assesses Landauer’s principle from information theory in the context of area quantization of the Schwarzschild black hole. Within a quantum-mechanical perspective where Hawking evaporation can be interpreted in terms of transitions between the discrete states of the area (or mass) spectrum, we justify that Landauer’s principle holds consistently in the saturated form when the number of microstates of the black hole goes as\(2^n\), where\(n\)is a large positive integer labeling the levels of the area/mass spectrum in the semiclassical regime. This is equivalent to the area spacing\(\Delta A = \alpha l_P^2\)(in natural units), where\(\alpha = 4 \ln 2\)for which the entropy spacing between consecutive levels in Boltzmann units coincides exactly with one bit of information. We also comment on the situation for other values of\(\alpha \)prevalent in the literature.
We present a comprehensive analysis of the semileptonic weak decays of\(B_c\)meson decaying to axial-vector (A) mesons for bottom-conserving and bottom-changing decay modes. We employ self-consistent covariant light-front quark model (CLF QM) that uses type-II correspondence to eliminate inconsistencies in the traditional type-I CLF QM. As a fresh attempt, we test the self-consistency in CLF QM through type-II correspondence for\(B_c \rightarrow A\)meson transition form factors. We establish that in type-II correspondence the form factors for longitudinal and transverse polarization states are numerically equal and are free from zero-mode contributions, which confirms the self-consistency of type-II correspondence for\(B_c \rightarrow A\)transition form factors. Furthermore, we ascertain that the problems of inconsistency and violation of covariance of CLF QM within the type-I correspondence are resolved in type-II correspondence for\(B_c \rightarrow A\)transitions. We thoroughly investigate the effects of self-consistency between type-I and type-II schemes using a comparative analysis. In this investigation, we employ a direct calculation approach to determine the form factors within the space-like region. Subsequently, we employ a vector meson dominance (VMD)-inspired three-parameter form to extrapolate these form factors into the physically accessible region. This enables us to study the\(q^2\)dependence of the form factors in weak hadronic currents for the whole accessible kinematic range for both bottom-conserving as well as bottom-changing transitions. In addition, we extend our analysis to predict the branching ratios of the semileptonic weak decays of\(B_c\)meson involving axial-vector meson in the final state to quantify the effects of self-consistency in these decays that were not studied before. We evaluate the lepton mass effect on these branching ratios and various other important physical observables, such as forward-backward asymmetries, lepton-side convexity parameter, asymmetry parameter, and longitudinal polarization asymmetries and fractions. Finally, we obtain the lepton flavor universality ratios for various decays.
Ceres is a key object in understanding the evolution of small bodies and is the only dwarf planet to have been orbited by a spacecraft, NASA’s Dawn mission. Dawn data paint an inconclusive picture of Ceres’ internal structure, composition and evolutionary pathway: crater morphology and gravity inversions suggest an ice-rich interior, while a lack of extensive crater relaxation argues for low ice content. Here we resolve this discrepancy by applying an ice rheology that includes effects of impurities on grain boundary sliding to finite element method simulations of Cerean craters. We show that Ceres can maintain its cratered topography while also having an ice-rich crust. Our simulations show that a crust with ~90% ice near the surface, which gradually decreases to 0% at 117 km depth, simultaneously matches the observed lack of crater relaxation, observed crater morphology and gravity inversions. This crustal structure results from a frozen ocean that became more impurity rich as it solidified top-down. Therefore, the Dawn data are consistent with an icy Ceres that evolved through freezing of an ancient, impure ocean.
A search for full energy depositions from bosonic keV-scale dark matter candidates of masses between 65 and 1021 keV has been performed with data collected during Phase II of the GERmanium Detector Array (Gerda) experiment. Our analysis includes direct dark matter absorption as well as dark Compton scattering. With a total exposure of 105.5 kg years, no evidence for a signal above the background has been observed. The resulting exclusion limits deduced with either Bayesian or Frequentist statistics are the most stringent direct constraints in the major part of the 140–1021 keV mass range. As an example, at a mass of 150 keV the dimensionless coupling of dark photons and axion-like particles to electrons has been constrained to\(\alpha '/\alpha <8.7~\times 10^{-24}\)and\(g_\textrm{ae}<3.3~\times 10^{-12}\)at 90% credible interval (CI), respectively. Additionally, a search for peak-like signals from beyond the Standard Model decays of nucleons and electrons is performed. We find for the inclusive decay of a single neutron in\(^{76}\)Ge a lower lifetime limit of\(\tau _\textrm{n} > 1.5 \times 10^{24}\)years and for a proton\(\tau _\textrm{p} > 1.3 \times 10^{24}\)years at 90% CI. For the electron decay\(e^\text {-} \rightarrow \nu _\textrm{e} \gamma \)a lower limit of\(\tau _\textrm{e} > 5.4\times 10^{25}\)years at 90% CI has been determined.
We study the production of\(D^0\)meson inp+pandp-Pb collisions using the improved AMPT model considering both coalescence and independent fragmentation of charm quarks after the Cronin broadening is included. After a detailed discussion of the improvements implemented in the AMPT model for heavy quark production, we show that the modified AMPT model can provide a good description of\(D^0\)meson spectra inp-Pb collisions, the\(Q_{\textrm{pPb}}\)data at different centralities and\(R_{\textrm{pPb}}\)data in both mid- and forward (backward) rapidities. We also studied the effects of nuclear shadowing and parton cascade on the rapidity dependence of\(D^{0}\)meson production and\(R_{\textrm{pPb}}\). Our results indicate that using the same strength of the Cronin effect (i.e\(\delta \)value) as that obtained from the mid-rapidity data leads to a considerable overestimation of the\(D^0\)meson spectra and\(R_{\textrm{pPb}}\)data at high\(p_{\textrm{T}}\)in the backward rapidity. As a result, the\(\delta \)is determined via a\(\chi ^2\)fitting of the\(R_{\textrm{pPb}}\)data across various rapidities. This work lays the foundation for a better understanding of cold-nuclear-matter (CNM) effects in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
Recent studies, in the context of consistency conditions for rapid-turn and third order slow-roll inflation in two-field models, raised the question whether this regime can be sustained for more than a few e-folds of expansion. We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that the consistency conditions themselves ensure the longevity of the rapid-turn regime. Furthermore, we prove this for the most general definition of rapid turning (i.e., with a turning rate that is large compared to the slow-roll parameters, but not necessarily large compared to unity), using in the process a generalized consistency condition. We also show that a special class of rapid-turn models, including angular inflation, satisfy a large-(compared to 1)-turn-rate condition even for non-large turning rates.
NASICON (Na\(_{1+x}\)Zr\(_2\)Si\(_x\)P\(_{3-x}\)O\(_{12}\)) is a well-established solid-state electrolyte, renowned for its high ionic conductivity and excellent chemical stability, rendering it a promising candidate for solid-state batteries. However, the intricate influence of ion doping on their performance has been a central focus of research, with existing studies often lacking comprehensive evaluation methods. This study introduces a deep-learning-based approach to efficiently evaluate ion-doped NASICON materials. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of predicting the performance of various ion-doped NASICON compounds by leveraging extensive datasets from prior experimental investigation. The model demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency in predicting ionic conductivity and electrochemical properties. Key findings include the successful synthesis and validation of three NASICON materials predicted by the model, with experimental results closely matching the model’s predictions. This research not only enhances the understanding of ion-doping effects in NASICON materials but also establishes a robust framework for material design and practical applications. It bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental validations.Graphical Abstract
The efforts in this contribution consist in reassessing a modified Dirac equation that incorporates a\(\gamma ^0 \gamma _5\)-Lorentz-symmetry violating (LSV) term induced as a Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) effect. Originally, this equation has been applied and considered as a good scenario for describing a number of investigations on the flight time of cosmic neutrinos, which suggests that the speed, in vacuum, in connection with the geometry that describes a granular space-time, takes the energy-dependent form, e.g.,\(v(E) =1 \pm E/E_{\text {\tiny LSV}}\), with\(E_{\text {\tiny LSV}} \approx 6,5 \times 10^{17}\)GeV for neutrinos. Once LQG provides a viable way to understand this picture consistently, we pursue an analysis of this effective Dirac equation to inspect some of its properties. These include: the derivation of the modified fermionic propagator, attainment of the Gordon decomposition of the vector current with minimal electromagnetic coupling to obtain information on the form factors, examination of the non-relativistic limit of the equation, evaluation of the spin- and velocity-dependent corrections to the Coulomb potential due to LQG effects, and the modified Hamiltonian in the low-relativistic regime. The study of the form factors may open up paths to set up bounds on the LQG parameters from the precision measurements of electromagnetic attributes of the charged leptons, such as their respective electric and magnetic dipole moments.
Generalized Kerr–Schild nilpotent deformations of an arbitrary background spacetime\(\overline{g}_{\mu \nu }(x)\)are considered. Those are of the form\(\overline{g}_{\mu \nu }+l_\mu l_\nu \)with\(l^2=0\). The relationship between the Ricci tensor of the background metric and the Ricci tensor of the deformed metric is found exactly. It consists of two terms, one is essentially the Fierz–Pauli operator, and the other is new. When the background is flat, the Kerr–Schild family is recovered. Novel examples for more general backgrounds (even including some simple sources) are discussed.
The BESIII experiment has been operating since 2009 and has received several upgrades, to study the\(\tau \)-charm physics utilizing the BEPCII accelerator. The BEPCII is a double-ring multi-bunch collider with a luminosity of\(1 \times 10^{33} \, {\text {cm}}^{-2} \, {\text {s}}^{-1}\)optimized at a center-of-mass (cms) energy of\(2 \times 1.89\)GeV. The rich physics topics, long lifetime and the large volume of data present challenges to offline data processing. This paper describes the design and implementation of the offline software system to meet the requirements and challenges of BESIII, including offline software architecture, geometry management, database management, event data model and tag-based analysis.
Hot Jupiters are expected to form far from their host star and move to a close-in, circular orbit through a smooth, monotonic decay due to mild and constant tidal dissipation. Yet, systems exhibiting planet-induced stellar pulsations have recently been found, suggesting unexpectedly strong tidal interactions. Here we combine stellar evolution and tide models to show that dynamical tides raised by eccentric gas giants can excite chains of resonance locks with several modes, which enriches the dynamics seen in single-mode resonance locking of circularized systems. These series of resonance locks yield orders of magnitude larger changes in eccentricity and harmonic pulsations relative to those expected from a single episode of resonance locking or non-resonant tidal interactions. Resonances become more frequent as a star evolves off the main sequence, which provides an alternative explanation for the origin of some stellar pulsators and leads to the concept of ‘dormant migrating giants’. Evolution trajectories are characterized by competing episodes of inward and outward migration and the spin-up or spin-down of the star, which are sensitive to the system parameters. This is a new challenge in modelling migration paths and in contextualizing the observed populations of giant exoplanets and stellar binaries. This sensitivity, however, offers a new window for constraining the stellar properties of planetary hosts through tidal asteroseismology.
The images of supermassive black holes captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration have allowed us to have access to the physical processes that occur in the vicinity of the event horizons of these objects. Furthermore, black hole imaging gives rise to a new way of testing general relativity in the strong field regime. This has initiated a line of research aimed at probing different physical scenarios. While many scenarios have been proposed in the literature that yield distortion effects that would be a priori detectable at the resolution achieved by future EHT observations, the vast majority of those scenarios involve strange objects or exotic matter content. Here, we consider a less heterodox scenario which, involving non-exotic matter, in the sense that it satisfies all energy conditions and is dynamically stable, also leads to a deformation of the black hole shadow. We consider a specific concentration of non-emitting, relativistic matter of zero optical depth forming a bubble around the black hole. Due to gravitational refraction, such a self-interacting—dark—matter concentration may produce sub-annular images, i.e. subleading images inside the photon ring. We calculate the ray tracing in the space-time geometry produced by such a matter configuration and obtain the corresponding black hole images. While for concreteness we restrict our analysis to a specific matter distribution, modeling the bubble as a thin-shell, effects qualitatively similar to those described here are expected to occur for more general density profiles.
In this work, we study the evolution of an evaporating black hole, described by the Kerr–Taub–NUT metric, which emits scalar particles. We found that allowing the black hole to radiate massless scalar particles increases the angular momentum loss rate while decreasing the loss rate of the NUT parameter and black hole mass. In fact, it means that angular momentum will disappear faster than the other black hole parameters (mass and NUT parameter) during the evaporation process. We also calculate the time evolution of the mass, angular momentum, and NUT parameter in order to get the evolution of the Von Neumann entropy of the black hole. We found that the entropy follows approximately the so-called Page curve, where the\(\beta \)parameter, which quantifies the amount of radiation, affects the evaporation process. Implying that high\(\beta \)values accelerate the evaporation process of a Kerr–Taub–NUT black hole.
The most massive galaxies in the Universe stopped forming stars due to the time-integrated feedback from central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, the exact quenching mechanism is not yet understood, because local massive galaxies were quenched billions of years ago. Here we present JWST/NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopy observations of GS-10578, a massive, quiescent galaxy at redshift z = 3.064 ± 0.002. From its spectrum, we measure a stellar massM⋆= 1.6 ± 0.2 × 1011M⊙and a dynamical massMdyn= 2.0 ± 0.5 × 1011M⊙. Half of its stellar mass formed atz= 3.7–4.6, and the system is now quiescent, with a current star-formation rate of less than 19 M⊙yr−1. We detect ionized- and neutral-gas outflows traced by [Oiii] emission and Naiabsorption, with mass outflow rates 0.14–2.9 and 30–100 M⊙yr−1, respectively. Outflow velocities reachvout≈ 1,000 km s−1, comparable to the galaxy escape velocity. GS-10578 hosts an active galactic nucleus, evidence that these outflows are due to SMBH feedback. The neutral outflow rate is higher than the star-formation rate. Hence, this is direct evidence for ejective SMBH feedback, with a mass loading capable of interrupting star formation by rapidly removing its fuel. Stellar kinematics show ordered rotation, with spin parameter\({\lambda }_{{{{R}}}_{{\rm{e}}}}=0.62\pm 0.07\), meaning GS-10578 is rotation-supported. This study presents direct evidence for ejective active galactic nucleus feedback in a massive, recently quenched galaxy, thus helping to clarify how SMBHs quench their hosts. The high value of\({\lambda }_{{{{R}}}_{{\rm{e}}}}\)implies that quenching can occur without destroying the stellar disk.
Boson stars are self-gravitating solutions made entirely of fundamental massive scalar fields. Here we investigate mini boson stars inDnon-compact spacetime dimensions and we show that they are dynamically unstable for\(D>4\).
Studying the thermodynamics of the systems produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is crucial in understanding the QCD phase diagram. Recently, a new avenue has opened regarding the implications of large initial angular momentum and subsequent vorticity in the medium evolution in high-energy collisions. This adds a new type of chemical potential into the partonic and hadronic systems, called the rotational chemical potential. We study the thermodynamics of an interacting hadronic matter under rotation, formed in an ultra-relativistic collision. We introduce attractive and repulsive interactions through the van der Waals equation of state. Thermodynamic properties like the pressure (P), energy density (\(\varepsilon \)), entropy density (s), trace anomaly (\((\varepsilon - 3P)/T^{4}\)), specific heat (\(c_\textrm{v}\)) and squared speed of sound (\(c_\textrm{s}^{2}\)) are studied as functions of temperature (T) for zero and finite rotation chemical potential. The conserved charge fluctuations, which can be quantified by their respective susceptibilities, are also studied. The rotational (spin) density corresponding to the rotational chemical potential is explored. In addition, we explore the possible liquid–gas phase transition in the hadron gas with van der Waals interaction in theT–\(\omega \)phase space.
A novel theory was proposed earlier to model systems with thermal gradients, based on the postulate that the spatial and temporal variation in temperature can be recast as a variation in the metric. Combining the variation in the metric due to the thermal variations and gravity, leads to the concept of thermal gravity in a 5-D space-time-temperature setting. When the 5-D Einstein field equations are projected on to a 4-D space, they result in additional terms in the field equations. This may lead to unique phenomena such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar particles in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This theory, originally conceived in a quantum mechanical framework, is now adapted to explain the galaxy rotation curves. A galaxy is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. A parameter called the “degree of thermalization” is introduced to model partially thermalized systems. The generalization of thermal gravity to partially thermalized systems, leads to the theory of many-body gravity. The theory of many-body gravity is now shown to be able to explain the rotation curves of the Milky Way and the M31 (Andromeda) galaxies, to a fair extent. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) for 63 galaxies, with their galactic masses spanning three orders of magnitude, has been replicated. Finally, the wide binary star (WBS) system is touched upon.
Using gamma-ray bursts as standard candles for cosmological parameter constraints rely on their empirical luminosity relations and low-redshift calibration. In this paper, we examine the Amati relation and its potential corrections based on the A118 sample of higher-quality gamma-ray bursts, using both Hubble data set and Pantheon+ samples as calibration samples in the redshift range of\(z<1.965\). In calibrating gamma-ray bursts using these two datasets, we employ Gaussian processes to obtain corresponding Hubble diagrams to avoid the dependence on cosmological models in the calibration process. We first divided the low-redshift sample of GRBs into two bins and examined the Amati relation and its potential modifications. We found that under both calibrations, the Amati relation did not show evidence of redshift evolution (68\(\%\)confidence level). For the other two Amati relations that include redshift evolution terms, the central values of the redshift evolution coefficients deviated from 0, but due to the limitations of the sample size and the increase in the number of parameters, most of the redshift evolution coefficients were not able to be excluded from 0 at the 1\(\sigma \)level. Therefore, to assess their situation across the entire redshift range, we employed MCMC to globally fit three types of Amati relations. By computing AIC and BIC, we found that for the GRB A118 sample, the standard Amati relation remains the most fitting empirical luminosity formula, and no potential redshift evolution trend was observed for two different low-redshift calibrating sources.
Using effective field theory methods, we derive the Carrollian analog of the geodesic action. We find that it contains both “electric” and “magnetic” contributions that are in general coupled to each other. The equations of motion descending from this action are the Carrollian pendant of geodesics, allowing surprisingly rich dynamics. As an example, we derive Carrollian geodesics on a Carroll–Schwarzschild background and discover an effective potential similar to the one appearing in geodesics on Schwarzschild backgrounds. However, the Newton term in the potential turns out to depend on the Carroll particle’s energy. As a consequence, there is only one circular orbit localized at the Carroll extremal surface, and this orbit is unstable. For large impact parameters, the deflection angle is half the value of the general relativistic light-bending result. For impact parameters slightly bigger than the Schwarzschild radius, orbits wind around the Carroll extremal surface. For small impact parameters, geodesics get reflected by the Carroll black hole, which acts as a perfect mirror.
Motivated by super Poisson–Lie (PL) symmetry of the Wess–Zumino–Witten (WZW) model based on the\((C^3+A)\)Lie supergroup of our previous work (Eghbali et al., in J High Energy Phys 07:134, 2013.arXiv:1303.4069[hep-th]), we first obtain and classify all Drinfeld superdoubles (DSDs) generated by the Lie superbialgebra structures on the\(({\mathscr {C}}^3+ {\mathscr {A}})\)Lie superalgebra as a theorem. Then, introducing a general formulation we find the conditions under which a two-dimensional\(\sigma \)-model may be equivalent to a WZW model. With the help of this formulation and starting the super PL symmetric\((C^3+A)\)WZW model, we get a hierarchy of WZW models related to super PL T-duality, in such a way that it is different from the super PL T-plurality, because the DSDs are, in this process, non-isomorphic. The most interesting indication of this work is that the\((C^3+A)\)WZW model does remain invariant under the super PL T-duality transformation, that is, the model is super PL self-dual.
Exotic spin-0 states with unusual couplings with the gauge and matter fields of the Standard Model are worth exploring at the CERN LHC. Though our approach is largely model independent, we take inspiration from flavor models based on some discrete symmetries which predict a set of a scalar and a pseudoscalar having purely off-diagonal Yukawa interactions with quarks and leptons. In a previous paper, some of us explored how to decipher such exotic scalar and pseudoscalar states whose off-diagonal Yukawa couplings involve light quarks. In this work we follow a complementary path and focus on the Yukawa couplings that necessarily involve a top quark. If one such spin-0 state is lighter than the top quark, then the rare decay of the latter, on account of the high yield of the\(t\bar{t}\)events, could provide a potential hunting ground of those exotic states particularly during the high luminosity phase of the LHC run. We carry out an exhaustive collider analysis of some promising signatures of those exotic states using sophisticated Machine Learning techniques and obtain considerable signal significance.
In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of the accelerated cosmic expansion in the late universe and the mass accretion process for a four-dimensional Einstein-Aether black hole. Starting with the basics of Einstein-Aether gravity theory, we first consider the field equations and two well-known models of Chaplygin gas, i.e., the generalized cosmic Chaplygin gas model and viscous modified Chaplygin gas model. We then obtain the energy density and Hubble parameter equations for these models in terms of various dimensionless density parameters and some unknown parameters. After finding the required parameters, we proceed with the mass accretion process. For both models, we obtain the equation of mass in terms of the redshift function and graphically represent the change in the mass of the black hole with a redshift. At the same time, we perform a graphical comparison between these models and the\(\Lambda \)CDM model of the universe. Finally, we conclude that the mass of a four-dimensional black hole will increase along the evolution of the universe within the framework of Einstein-Aether gravity.
We study the properties of massive fermions created and scattered by a rotating Kerr black hole. The helicities of the scattered fermions can vary during propagation. A fermion with a right-handed helicity can become either right or left-handed after interacting with the gravitational potential. This implies that measuring characteristics of an escaping particle is insufficient to reconstruct all the characteristics of its infalling partner. This further means the helicities of a particle pair created by the gravitational potential are not fully entangled. Since spin and helicity share many common features, it is likely that the same is true for spins of spontaneously created particles.
In this paper, we introduce unitary flavour violation to produce multi-Higgs doublets models where all flavour par ameters are contained within three unitary matrices. After that, we identify two of its subclasses, the left and right models, which have naturally suppressed tree-lev el flavour changing neutral couplings that easily avoid the experimental constraints derived from neutral meson mi xing. Then, we show that left models can accomodate spontaneous CP violation when all quarks have flavour changing neutr al couplings. Finally, we illustrate these concepts by considering a specific implementation with three Higgs doublets.
If two ultrarelativistic nonrotating black holes of masses\(m_1\)and\(m_2\)approach each other with fixed center-of-momentum (COM) total energy\(E = \sqrt{s} \gg (m_1+m_2)c^2\)that has a corresponding Schwarzschild radius\(R = 2GE/c^4\)much larger than the Schwarzschild radii of the individual black holes, here it is conjectured that at the critical impact parameter\(b_c\)between scattering and coalescing into a single black hole, there will be an inspiral of many orbital rotations for\(m_1c^2/E \ll 1\)and\(m_2c^2/E \ll 1\)before a final black hole forms, during which all of the initial kinetic energy will be radiated away in gravitational waves by the time the individual black holes coalesce and settle down to a stationary state. In the massless limit\(m_1 = m_2 = 0\), in which the black holes are replaced by classical massless point particles, it is conjectured that for the critical impact parameter, all of the total energy will be radiated away by the time the two particle worldlines merge and end. One might also conjecture that in the limit of starting with the massless particles having infinite energy in the infinite past with the correct ratio of impact parameter to energy, the spacetime for retarded time before the final worldline merger at zero energy will have a homothetic vector field and hence be self similar. Evidence against these conjectures is also discussed, and if it proves correct, I conjecture that two massless particles can form any number of black holes.
The current experiments searching for neutrinoless double-\(\beta \)(\(0\nu \beta \beta \)) decay also collect large statistics of Standard Model allowed two-neutrino double-\(\beta \)(\(2\nu \beta \beta \)) decay events. These can be used to search for Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics via\(2\nu \beta \beta \)decay spectral distortions.100Mo has a natural advantage due to its relatively short half-life, allowing higher\(2\nu \beta \beta \)decay statistics at equal exposures compared to the other isotopes. We demonstrate the potential of the dual read-out bolometric technique exploiting a100Mo exposure of 1.47 kg\(\times \)years, acquired in the CUPID-Mo experiment at the Modane underground laboratory (France). We set limits on\(0\nu \beta \beta \)decays with the emission of one or more Majorons, on\(2\nu \beta \beta \)decay with Lorentz violation, and\(2\nu \beta \beta \)decay with a sterile neutrino emission. In this analysis, we investigate the systematic uncertainty induced by modeling the\(2\nu \beta \beta \)decay spectral shape parameterized through an improved model, an effect never considered before. This work motivates searches for BSM processes in the upcoming CUPID experiment, which will collect the largest amount of\(2\nu \beta \beta \)decay events among the next-generation experiments.
A regular method is proposed that makes it possible to obtain a new exact solution with a wormhole from any topologically trivial exact solution of the Einstein–Maxwell equations in an electrovacuum (topological dressing method). This solution has a structure similar to a thin-shell wormhole, but unlike it, it is exact and therefore does not require the presence of any other field sources. It is shown that the wormhole itself creates both gravitational and electromagnetic fields. The corresponding effective mass and effective charge are distributed over the surface of its throat and around it. Topological dressing of the Reissner–Nordström solution with zero effective mass and non-zero effective charge gives a new solution describing a traversable wormhole. It is shown that this solution is stable in the presence of external pressure.
The Two Higgs Doublet model extended with a complex scalar singlet (2HDMS) is a well-motivated Beyond Standard Model candidate addressing several open problems of nature. In this work, we focus on the dark matter (DM) phenomenology of the complex scalar singlet where the real part of the complex scalar obtains a vacuum expectation value. The model is characterized by an enlarged Higgs spectrum comprising six physical Higgs bosons and a pseudoscalar DM candidate. We address the impact of accommodating the 95 GeV excess on the 2HDMS parameter space and DM observables after including all theoretical and experimental constraints. Finally, we look into the prospects of this scenario at HL-LHC and future lepton colliders for a representative benchmark.
Cryogenic scintillating calorimeters are ultra- sensitive particle detectors for rare event searches, particularly for the search for dark matter and the measurement of neutrino properties. These detectors are made from scintillating target crystals generating two signals for each particle interaction. The phonon (heat) signal precisely measures the deposited energy independent of the type of interacting particle. The scintillation light signal yields particle discrimination on an event-by-event basis. This paper presents a likelihood framework modeling backgrounds and a potential dark matter signal in the two-dimensional plane spanned by phonon and scintillation light energies. We apply the framework to data from CaWO\(_4\)-based detectors operated in the CRESST dark matter search. For the first time, a single likelihood framework is used in CRESST to model the data and extract results on dark matter in one step by using a profile likelihood ratio test. Our framework simultaneously fits (neutron) calibration data and physics (background) data and allows combining data from multiple detectors. Although tailored to CaWO\(_4\)-targets and the CRESST experiment, the framework can easily be expanded to other materials and experiments using scintillating cryogenic calorimeters for dark matter search and neutrino physics.
The neutrino trident scattering process in neutrino-tungsten interactions at the LHC energy regime is investigated, and the cross-sections for different leptonic final states in coherent and incoherent interactions are estimated. Furthermore, the associated number of events at FASER\(\nu \)2 detector is estimated considering different predictions for the flux of incident neutrinos on the detector, based on distinct hadronic models for the particle production inppcollisions at ultra-forward rapidities. Our results indicate that the observation of the neutrino trident process is, in principle, feasible at the Forward Physics Facility.
The Abelian decomposition of QCD reveals two types of gluons: color-neutral “neurons” and color-carrying “chromons”. This classification does not alter the overall properties of QCD, but the investigation of different types of gluon dynamics is necessary. By employing the Cho–Duan–Ge decomposition theorem, we have derived dynamic evolution equations for two types of gluons by using the time-ordered perturbation theory. We propose that the new equations are compatible with the DGLAP equations, requiring only the separate contributions of neurons and chromons to be summed. Surprisingly, with the evolution to high\(Q^2\), the ratio of the number of chromons to neurons is approximately 3:1 in small-xregion regardless of the inputs at evolution starting point. The new gluon dynamic equations reevaluate the gluon distribution functions and allow for a elaborate investigation of the distinct contributions of gluons in high-energy collisions.
This paper presents the energy dependence of multiplicity and net-electric charge fluctuations inp+pinteractions at beam momenta 20, 31, 40, 80, and 158\(\text{ Ge }\hspace{-1.00006pt}\text{ V }\!/\!c\). Results are corrected for the experimental biases and quantified with the use of cumulants and factorial cumulants. Cumulant ratios are an essential tool in the search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter in heavy ion collisions. Measurements performed inp+pinteractions provide a vital baseline estimation in these studies. The measured signals are compared with the string hadronic modelsEpos1.99and FTFP-BERT.
We have studied the spin polarization of\(\Lambda \)hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies\(\sqrt{s_\textrm{NN}}= 200\)GeV and\(\sqrt{s_\textrm{NN}}= 5.02\)TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of\(\Lambda \)stemming from the decays of polarized\(\Sigma ^*\)and\(\Sigma ^0\)hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the quark gluon plasma.
The Bohr and von Neumann views on the measurement process in quantum mechanics have been interpreted for a long time in somewhat controversial terms, often leading to misconceptions. On the basis of some textual analysis, I would like to show that—contrary to a widespread opinion—their views should be taken less inconsistent, and much closer to each other, than usually thought. As a consequence, I claim that Bohr and von Neumann are conceptually on the same side on the issue of the universality of quantum mechanics: hopefully, this might contribute to a more accurate history of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.
This study aims into brane-world scenarios within the framework off(R,A) gravity called Ricci-inverse modified theory, exploring the dynamics of spin-1/2 fermions coupled non-minimally to background scalar field functions. Through theoretical analysis and numerical techniques, we investigate the localization of both massless and massive fermionic modes on the brane. Our findings shows intricate phenomena, including unexpected configurations of the effective potentials and the identification of resonance modes in massive fermionic spectra. These insights shed light on the interplay between modified gravity and matter in extra-dimensional models, offering promising avenues for experimental validation and furthering our understanding of fundamental physics.
We investigate the role of topology on the lattice determination of the\({\textrm{SU}}(3)\)strong coupling renormalized via gradient flow. To deal with the topological freezing of standard local algorithms, the definition of the coupling is usually projected onto the zero topological sector. However, it is not obvious that this definition is not biased by the loss of ergodicity. We instead avoid the topological freezing using a novel algorithm, the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions. The comparison with a standard algorithm shows that, even in the case where the latter is severely frozen, one obtains the same projected coupling. Moreover, we show that the two definitions of the coupling, projected and non-projected, lead to the same flow of the renormalization scale. Our results imply that projecting the coupling does not affect the determination of the dynamically-generated scale of the theory\(\varLambda \), as obtained through the step-scaling method.
We discuss a collider probe of a dark sector model in which the dark matter is charged under a new, hiddenU(1) gauge group. In particular, we look for the so-called Darkstrahlung process, in which the final states dark matter radiates a new\(Z^\prime \)gauge boson and it manifests as dilepton resonances. This work emphasizes the potential of dilepton final states with missing transverse energy in probing the darkstrahlung process. We recast the ATLAS Run 2 search for dilepton resonances in association with missing energy in addition to the ATLAS and CMS searches for sleptons. We find that the recasted searches put strong constraints on the coupling between the dark matter and the\(Z^\prime \). Moreover, we evaluate refined search strategies for\(Z^\prime \)production and propose an analysis employing constraints on the lepton invariant mass and higher missing energy cut related to the darkstrahlung process. Simulation outcomes indicate substantial enhancements, particularly by a factor of 6 in regions featuring lower\(Z^\prime \)masses. Finally, we also discuss the case when the\(Z^\prime \)has a long lifetime, resulting in displaced decay of the boson.
The Yang–Mills–Chern–Simons theory in three-dimensional Minkowski space-time is studied in a gauge-fixing scheme which interpolates between the covariant gauge and light-cone gauge, the interpolating gauge-fixing. The ultraviolet finiteness of the theory is proved via the Becchi–Rouet–Stora (BRS) algebraic renormalization procedure, which allows us to demonstrate the vanishing of all\(\beta \)-functions and all anomalous dimensions to all orders in perturbation theory.
We present simple effective theory of quark masses, mixing and CP violation with level\(N=3\)(\(A_4\)) modular symmetry, which provides solution to the strong CP problem without the need for an axion. The vanishing of the strong CP-violating phase\({\bar{\theta }}\)is ensured by assuming CP to be a fundamental symmetry of the Lagrangian of the theory. The CP symmetry is broken spontaneously by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the modulus\(\tau \). This provides the requisite large value of the CKM CP-violating phase while the strong CP phase\({\bar{\theta }}\)remains zero or is tiny. Within the considered framework we discuss phenomenologically viable quark mass matrices with three types of texture zeros, which are realized by assigning both the left-handed and right-handed quark fields to\(A_4\)singlets\(\textbf{1}\),\({\mathbf{1'}}\)and\(\mathbf{1''}\)with appropriate weights. The VEV of\(\tau \)is restricted to reproduce the observed CKM parameters. We discuss cases in which the modulus VEV is close to the fixed pointsi,\(\omega \)and\(i\infty \). In particular, we focus on the VEV of\(\tau \), which gives the absolute minima of the supergravity-motivated modular- and CP-invariant potentials for the modulus\(\tau \), so called, modulus stabilisation. We present a successful model, which is consistent with the modulus stabilisation close to\(\tau =\omega \).
An investigation has been done for possible existence of evolving wormhole (WH) solution in the background of inhomogeneous Lemaitre–Tolman–Bondi (LTB) space-time geometry. Using separable product form of the geometric (or area) radius, the shape function can be evaluated in terms of the functional part of the radial coordinate in the area radius. The conditions for a viable WH configuration have been examined.
Here, we investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in non-minimal coupling Gauss–Bonnet inflationary model in the presence of power-law potentials. We employ a two part coupling function to enhance primordial curvatures at small scales as well as satisfy Planck measurements at the CMB scale. Moreover, our model satisfies the swampland criteria. We find PBHs with different mass scales and demonstrate that PBHs with masses around\(\mathcal {O}(10^{-14})M_{\odot }\)can account for almost all of the dark matter in the universe. In addition, we investigate the implications of the reheating stage and show that the PBHs in our model are generated during the radiation-dominated era. Furthermore, we investigate the production of scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs). More interestingly enough is that, for the specific cases\(D_\textrm{n}\)in our model, the GWs can be considered as a source of PTA signal. Also, we conclude that the GWs energy density parameter at the nano-Hz regime can be parameterized as\(\Omega _\mathrm{GW_0} (f) \sim f^{5-\gamma }\), where the obtained\(\gamma \)is consistent with the PTA Observations.
The mass distribution of black holes identified through X-ray emission suggests a paucity of black holes in the mass range of 3 to 5 solar masses. Modified theories have been devised to explain this mass gap, and it is suggested that natal kicks during a supernova explosion can more easily disrupt binaries with lower-mass black holes. Although recent Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory observations reveal the existence of compact remnants within this mass gap, the question of whether low-mass black holes can exist in binaries remains a matter of debate. Such a system is expected to be non-interacting and without X-ray emission, and can be searched for using radial-velocity and astrometric methods. Here we report on Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) 3425577610762832384, which is a wide binary system that includes a red giant star and an unseen object, exhibiting an orbital period of approximately 880 days and a near-zero eccentricity. Through the combination of radial-velocity measurements from the Large Aperture Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope and astrometric data from Gaia DR2 and DR3 catalogues, we determine a mass of\(3.{6}_{-0.5}^{+0.8}\,{M}_{\odot }\)of the unseen component. If the unseen companion is a black hole, its mass would fall within the gap and it would strongly suggest the existence of binary systems containing low-mass black holes. More notably, the formation of its surprisingly wide circular orbit challenges current binary evolution and supernova explosion theories.
The nature of the organic matter in interplanetary samples is central to elucidating the formation and early evolution of the Solar System. Although most meteorites derive from asteroids, micrometeorites mainly sample more remote objects. Ultra-carbonaceous Antarctic micrometeorites (UCAMMs), which have the highest carbon content among interplanetary samples, offer a unique window into cometary organics. Here we report a survey of the H, C and N isotopes in four UCAMMs, of which two are15N-poor (δ15N ≃ −120‰), which suggests that their formation involved primordial N2(δ15N ≃ −380‰). Such a composition could be the result of Galactic cosmic ray irradiation of N2ices at the surface of cold small bodies in the outermost parts of the Solar System, possibly the Oort cloud. The two other UCAMMs exhibit higher δ15N (75‰ and 282‰), like those reported for carbonaceous chondrites and interplanetary dust particles. They may originate from parent bodies initially on lower heliocentric orbits in the Kuiper belt that have surfaces cold enough to retain N-bearing species, such as cyanides (δ15N ≥ 200‰), that are richer in15N than primordial N2. According to their elemental and isotopic composition, UCAMMs constitute a unique probe into the coldest objects of the Solar System, namely those in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort cloud, which are largely out of reach of current space exploration.
Unifying quantum theory and gravity remains a fundamental challenge in physics. While most existing literature focuses on the ultraviolet modifications of quantum theory due to gravity, this work shows that generic infrared modifications arise when we describe quantum theory in curved spacetime. We explicitly demonstrate that the modifications to the position-momentum algebra are proportional to curvature invariants (such as the Ricci scalar and Kretschmann scalar). Our results, derived through a rigorous application of Dirac’s quantization procedure, demonstrate that infrared effects in quantum systems can be axiomatically derived. We study particle dynamics in an arbitrary curved spacetime by embedding them in a higher-dimensional flat geometry. Our approach, which involves embedding particle dynamics in a higher-dimensional flat geometry and utilizing Dirac’s quantization procedure, allows us to capture the dynamics of a particle in 4-dimensional curved spacetime through a modified position-momentum algebra. When applied to various spacetimes, this method reveals that the corrections due to the spacetime curvature are universal. We further compare our results with those derived using extended uncertainty principles. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work for black holes and entanglement.
In this research, we explore the electromagnetic energy emitted by astrophysical black holes within the Kerr+PFDM (Kerr + perfect fluid dark matter) spacetime, a model  comprising rotating black holes surrounded by dark matter. Our investigation focuses on black holes within X-ray binary systems, namely GRS 1915+105, GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, A0620-00, H1743-322, and GRS 1124-683. Our findings indicate that the Kerr+PFDM spacetime can account for the radiative efficiency of these sources as determined through the continuum-fitting method (CFM). Additionally, employing the Blandford–Znajek mechanism, we demonstrate the ability to replicate the observed jet power. By combining the outcomes of both analyses for the selected objects, we establish more rigorous constraints on the spacetime parameters. Notably, our results reveal that, similar to the Kerr spacetime, the Kerr+PFDM spacetime cannot simultaneously account for the observed jet power and radiative efficiency of GRS 1915+105.
AbstractThe increase in energetic electron flux is a complex nonlinear phenomenon with a profound impact on satellite operations in geosynchronous orbit. Previous research, conducted both locally and internationally, has developed models relying on extensive data to predict occurrences associated with the amplification of high-energy electron fluxes. This study conducts a comprehensive examination of significant research discoveries in the field, with a specific focus on selecting prediction factors and methods for designing forecast models. The study introduces key features of solar wind parameters and their correlation with high-energy electron fluxes, emphasizing the selection of forecast factors. Additionally, it highlights the attributes of geomagnetic indices and their relationship with solar wind parameters. Linear and nonlinear models are presented, with linear models categorized as single-input and multi-input, and nonlinear models classified as single-model design and fusion-model design. The study also explores shallow and deep models as distinct methodologies in nonlinear modeling. In conclusion, this study provides an overview of current research findings and approaches while offering insights into the future development patterns in this domain for the forthcoming term.
AbstractThe three largest impact craters, the remains of which have been found on Earth to date, had diameters of about 200 km immediately after formation. The search for traces of larger impact structures continues. This paper presents the results of numerical modeling of the formation of terrestrial impact craters larger than those already found. It is shown that the inferred geothermal gradient significantly influences the initial geometry of the impact melt region, which may facilitate the search for the remains of deeply eroded ancient impact structures.
AbstractActive asteroids are the Main-Belt asteroids that manifest physical signs of cometary activity, such as the presence of coma and tails and significant changes in brightness. This raises the question of whether these bodies require a more sophisticated approach to specifying the orbital parameters as compared to ordinary asteroids. In this work, we performed a series of improvements in the orbital parameters of active asteroids (6478) Gault and (248370) 2005 QN173/433P both with taking into account nongravitational accelerations (NGAs), which is common for comets, and without this procedure. For time intervals coinciding with the periods of activity of the considered asteroids, we have found statistically significant systematic deviations in the residuals (O–C) between the observed and calculated values in the positional observations of these bodies. Our results show that taking into account the nongravitational acceleration according to the Marsden model does not improve the representation of the observations. We also considered the possibility of the photocenter shift (PS) presence in the positional observations, i.e., the offset between the center-of-light and the center-of-mass. The obtained PS for asteroids (6478) and (248370) are directed away from the Sun with the values of 985 ± 54 and 1145 ± 119 km respectively, which is close to the sizes of the Hill spheres of the bodies. Taking into account the PS effect, one can eliminate the systematic deviations in the residuals for asteroid (248370) and significantly reduce them for asteroid (6478).
Abstract—The paper briefly discusses hypotheses about the nature of a centuries-old mysterious phenomenon, for which there is still no clear explanation. Its essence is that an observer, usually located at a distance of 50–100 km from a flying meteor body, sometimes hears sound simultaneously with its radiation. It seems that sound travels at the speed of light. Historically, the situation was such that it was only no more than sixty years ago that attempts to instrumentally study this unusual phenomenon began. The difficulty of these searches is also due to the fact that only a few percent of the total number of observed meteoroids have this property. About forty years ago it was discovered that meteoroids can emit electromagnetic pulses of varying duration and frequency composition. However, it turned out that this fact does not always have an unambiguous relationship to electrophonic phenomena. This paper provides a brief overview of the most meaningful hypotheses and experiments of past years. It is possible that this phenomenon is of a fundamental nature and its study can introduce previously unknown information into science.
Abstract—Determining water concentrations in the polar regions of the Moon is one of the priority tasks of a number of space missions and, in particular, the Luna-27 mission. The complex of scientific equipment of theLuna-27spacecraft includes time-of-flight laser ionization mass spectrometer LASMA-LR, the main task of which is to analyze the elemental composition of the regolith at the landing site. The design and configuration of the flight instrument is adapted for the analysis of regolith and was not originally intended for the study of volatile compounds. However, due to the importance of determining the water content in regolith, we reviewed some approaches to analyzing samples during lunar missions and assessed the applicability of LASMA-LR and the laser ionization mass spectrometry method in general for identifying water in regolith. It has been established that using this instrument it is possible to detect water in regolith, including determining its state (chemically bound and unbound water). Moreover, the conditions for sampling the regolith and delivering it to the soil receiving device of the instrument are critically important for the analysis, since under the conditions of the lunar surface, sublimation of ice is possible before the samples are analyzed. This technique has advantages over some other methods of analyzing water and/or ice used in space experiments, and can be used in the study of a number of planets and bodies of the Solar System.
Abstract—In 2020, two telescopes of the State Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences, ZA-320M and MTM-500M, obtained series of observations of the potentially dangerous asteroid 65690 (1991 DG) during its approach to the Earth and carried out their astrometric and photometric processing. Using the coordinates of the asteroid and observations from the MRS site, the orbit of the asteroid was clarified, and the circumstances of the approaches to the Earth and Mars were determined, and an assessment was made of the influence of nongravitational effects on its orbit. Based on the results of photometric processing of the asteroid, a light curve was constructed and the period of its axial rotation was determined:P= 4.3193 ± 0.0028 h.
The behaviors of null geodesics in the spherical symmetric black holes in Einstein–Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) theory with coupling function\(f(\Phi )=e^{-2\alpha \Phi }\)are meticulously analyzed. We investigate the effects of coupling constant\(\alpha \)on the effective potential of photon trajectories within three ranges, namely\(0<\alpha <1\),\(\alpha =1\)and\(\alpha >1\). We find that the thicknesses of lensing and photon rings are smaller at larger\(\alpha \)and fixed electric charge in the unit of massq, whereas they are larger at fixed\(\alpha \)and largerq. This behavior can be described by using the angular Lyapunov exponent\(\gamma \)in the vicinity of the critical curve. Remarkably, the behaviors of photon trajectories are found to be more interesting when\(\alpha >1\). Namely, the radius of the black hole shadow\(R_\text {s}\)becomes to be smaller than the photon sphere radius\(r_\text {ph}\)when\(\alpha > 1\)and\(q>q^*\). Moreover,\(R_\text {s}\)goes to zero asqsaturates the extremal limit, beyond which the photon orbit becomes absent. Furthermore, we construct the optical appearance of black holes surrounded by optically and geometrically thin accretion disk with three cases of Gralla–Lupsasca–Marrone (GLM) emission profile. Our results indicate that the observed flux originating from the lensing and photon rings exhibits suppression as\(\alpha \)increases, while it undergoes amplification with the increasing parameterq.
Abstract—This paper examines the dynamic evolution of the compact three-planet system Kepler-51. Possible resonant states of the system are analyzed and a search for potential chains of mean motion resonances is carried out. Using the Posidonius software package the dynamic evolution of the system is studied over a time interval of 100 Myr, taking into account tidal interaction. Also, for various initial values of eccentricities, inclinations, arguments of periapsis and longitudes of the ascending nodes of orbits, modeling of the dynamic evolution of the planetary system is carried out within the framework of the semi-analytical theory of motion. It is shown that the compact planetary system Kepler-51 is not resonant. Under initial conditions corresponding to the masses and elements of the planets’ orbits, determined from observations taking into account their errors, the evolution of the system is stable and regular over the studied interval of 100 Myr.
Abstract—The hydrodynamic instability of a magnetized, self-gravitating rotating anisotropic plasma is analyzed in the collisionless approximation and considering the heat flux vector based on the modified Chu–Goldberger–Low equations. A dispersion relation is obtained, on the basis of which simplified cases of propagation of low-amplitude disturbance waves and the derivation of modified criteria for hydrodynamic instability are discussed. Using the obtained dispersion relation, three simple cases are treated when the disturbance wave propagates across, along, and obliquely to the magnetic field vector. It is shown that the anisotropy of pressure and heat flow not only changes the classical criterion of the Jeans instability, but also leads to the appearance of new wave modes and causes the appearance of new unstable domains. It has been found that the presence of uniform rotation of the plasma reduces the critical wave number and has a stabilizing effect on the criterion of gravitational instability when the disturbance wave propagates transversely, without having an effect in the case of longitudinal propagation. These results are important for developing evolutionary magnetohydrodynamic models of astrophysical collisionless plasma.
AbstractWe use a paraboloid model of Mercury’s magnetosphere and magnetometer data from the MESSEN-GER spacecraft obtained in April 2011 to determine the optimal parameters of Mercury’s magnetospheric current systems, in the sense that they yield the smallest discrepancy (less than 10 nT) between model predictions and measurements. The obtained model data are compared with experimental data and the KT17 model of Mercury’s magnetospheric magnetic field.
Monte Carlo simulations are a crucial component when analysing the Standard Model and New physics processes at the Large Hadron Collider. This paper aims to explore the performance of generative models for complementing the statistics of classical Monte Carlo simulations in the final stage of data analysis by generating additional synthetic data that follows the same kinematic distributions for a limited set of analysis-specific observables to a high precision. Several deep generative models are adapted for this task and their performance is systematically evaluated using a well-known benchmark sample containing the Higgs boson production beyond the Standard Model and the corresponding irreducible background. The paper evaluates the autoregressive models and normalizing flows and the applicability of these models using different model configurations is investigated. The best performing model is chosen for a further evaluation using a set of statistical procedures and a simplified physics analysis. By implementing and performing a series of statistical tests and evaluations we show that a machine-learning-based generative procedure can be used to generate synthetic data that matches the original samples closely enough and that it can therefore be incorporated in the final stage of a physics analysis with some given systematic uncertainty.
We are studying the effects of Self-Interacting dark radiation (SIdr) on the evolution of the universe. Our main focus is on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and how SIdr could potentially help resolve the Hubble tension. We are looking into different scenarios by mixing SIdr with Free-Streaming dark radiation (FSdr) or not to determine whether SIdr can indeed contribute to solving the Hubble tension. We find that SIdr alone can increase the Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) to\(70.1_{-1.6}^{+1.3}, \text {km/s/Mpc}\)with a value of\(N_\textrm{eff}=3.27_{-0.31}^{+0.23}\). However, including FSdr disfavors the existence of SIdr\({\tilde{N}}_\textrm{si}\approx 0.37\). Even though the Hubble constant is increased compared to the predicted value, it entails\(N_\textrm{eff}=3.52\pm 0.25\). Finally, we implement the Fisher method for future experiments and a\(7.64\sigma \)measurement of\({\tilde{N}}_\textrm{si}\)will be obtained when combing data from Planck, AliCPT, and CMB-S4.
In this study, we focus on examining the characteristics of electromagnetic fields within a curved space-time background under the framework of Eddington-inspired Born–Infeld (EiBI) gravity, in the presence of a global monopole. We derived Maxwell’s vacuum field equations in this curved spacetime and obtained a set of linear differential equations for the electric and magnetic fields. After decoupling these equations, we solved for the analytical solutions of both the electric and magnetic fields using special functions. We then extended our analysis to the same EiBI-gravity framework, this time incorporating a cosmic string. Following a similar approach, we derived the first-order differential equations governing the electric and magnetic fields and obtained their analytical solutions using special functions. Our findings demonstrate significant influences of the global monopole, cosmic string, and the Eddington parameters on the behavior of electromagnetic waves in this curved space-time configuration with topological defects, resulting in notable deviations from the Minkowski flat space case.
We investigate the precessing motion around the the regular black hole with an asymptotically Minkowski core which has a suppression parameter\(\ell \). We obtain the third-order post-Newtonian quasi-Keplerian motion of a test particle in this spacetime and find its relativistic periastron advance. Then, we test this model with the precessing motion of the star S2 and of OJ 287 and determine the upper limits of the dimensionless suppression parameter as\(\ell /m \sim 10^{-3}\), wheremis the mass of the black hole. Compared with the bound given by the shadow of Sgr A*, our bound on\(\ell /m\)is reduced by 2 orders of magnitude, although our upper limit of\(\ell \)still needs further improvement.
The nature of dark matter remains one of the greatest unanswered questions in science. The largest concentrations of dark matter appear to lie in galaxy clusters. By modifying the properties of dark matter, the distribution of mass in clusters is altered in an observable way. However, uncertain astrophysical mechanisms also alter the mass distribution, often mimicking the effect of different dark matter properties. Here I present a machine learning method that ‘learns’, from simulations, how the impact of dark matter self-interactions differs from that of astrophysical feedback. In the idealized case, my algorithm is 80% accurate at identifying whether a galaxy cluster harbours collisionless dark matter, dark matter with a self interaction cross-section,σDM/m= 0.1 cm2g−1or dark matter withσDM/m= 1 cm2g−1. It is found that weak-lensing information primarily differentiates self-interacting dark matter, whereas X-ray information disentangles different models of astrophysical feedback. The data are forward modelled to imitate observations from Euclid and Chandra, and it is found that the model has a statistical error ofσDM/m< 0.01 cm2g−1and is insensitive to shape-measurement bias and photometric-redshift errors. This method represents a way to analyse data from upcoming telescopes that are an order of magnitude more precise and many orders faster than current methods, enabling us to explore the properties of dark matter like never before.
In this paper, we present new generalized wormhole (WH) solutions within the context off(R) gravity. Specifically, we focus onf(R) gravitational theories formulated in the metric formalism, with our investigation centered on a power-law form represented by\(f(R) = \epsilon R^{\chi }\). Here,\(\epsilon \)is an arbitrary constant, and\(\chi \)is a real number. Notably, this form possesses the advantageous property of reducing to Einstein gravity when\(\epsilon =1\)and\(\chi =1\). To obtain these novel WH solutions, we establish the general field equations for anyf(R) theory within the framework of Morris–Thorne spacetime, assuming metric coefficients that are independent of time. By utilizing an anisotropic matter source and a specific type of energy density associated with solitonic quantum wave (SQW) and cold dark matter (CDM) halos, we calculate two distinct WH solutions. We thoroughly investigate the properties of the exotic matter (ExoM) residing within the WH geometry and analyze the matter contents through energy conditions (ECs). Both analytical and graphical methods are employed in this analysis to examine the validity of different regions. Notably, the calculated shape functions for the WH geometry satisfy the necessary conditions in both scenarios, emphasizing their reliability. Our investigations into specific parameter ranges in both scenarios revealed the presence of ExoM. This ExoM is characterized by an energy–momentum tensor that violates the null energy condition (NEC) and, consequently, the weak energy condition as well, in the vicinity of the WH throats. Furthermore, we investigated the repulsive effect of gravity and discovered that its presence results in a negative deflection angle for photons following null geodesics. Importantly, we observed that the deflection angle consistently exhibits negative values across all\(r_0\)values in both scenarios, indicating the manifestation of the repulsive gravity effect. Finally, we compare the obtained WH solutions utilizing both distributions, as well as thef(R) power-law-like models, in order to assess the feasibility of energetic configurations for WHs within SQW and CDM systems.
In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of Bardeen black hole which is coupled with cloud of strings and minimally coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics. The modified entropy in the form of Sharma–Mittal entropy is used to discuss these properties which include mass, temperature, pressure, Gibbs free energy and trace of Hessian matrix. We obtain stable behavior along with physical solution for some specific values of parametersaandq. Furthermore, our work provides a thermodynamic metric using the Hessian matrix of black hole mass, changing the conformal connection between Quevedo and Ruppeiner’s geometries. Investigating the first principle of thermodynamics for regular black holes, such as the Bardeen AdS black hole, exposes significant behavior changes during phase transitions in an extended phase space.
This study investigates the classical Higgs inflation model with a modified Higgs potential featuring a dip. We examine the implications of this modification on the generation of curvature perturbations, stochastic gravitational wave production, and the potential formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). Unlike the classical model, the modified potential allows for enhanced power spectra and the existence of PBHs within a wide mass range\(1.5\times 10^{20}\)g–\(9.7\times 10^{32}\)g. We identify parameter space regions that align with inflationary constraints and have the potential to contribute significantly to the observed dark matter content. Additionally, the study explores the consistency of the obtained parameter space with cosmological constraints and discusses the implications for explaining the observed excess in gravitational wave PTA signals, particularly in the NANOGrav experiment. Overall, this investigation highlights the relevance of the modified Higgs potential in the classical Higgs inflation model, shedding light on the formation of PBHs, the nature of dark matter, and the connection to gravitational wave observations.
We employ the LuxQED approach to compute the polarized photon PDF (photon pPDF). This approach expresses the pPDF in terms of the structure functions\(g_1\)and\(g_2\). Different models for the structure functions are employed according to the parameter space region. The resulting pPDF is approximately of the order ofxtimes the unpolarized PDF. The relative uncertainty in the photon pPDF reaches up to 50% for\(x \sim 10^{-3}\), decreasing to approximately 10% for higher values ofx. The computation of the photon pPDF will be essential for improving the precision of polarized calculations and will have fundamental implications for studies at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).
The origin of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centres of most galaxies remains a mystery. The Event Horizon Telescope has provided direct imaging of the SMBH Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) at the Milky Way’s centre, indicating that it probably spins rapidly with its spin axis substantially misaligned relative to the Galactic plane’s angular momentum. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the inferred spin properties of Sgr A* provide evidence of a potential past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and the Gaia-Enceladus progenitor, which had a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of a SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 145–180° with respect to the line of sight can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This possible merger event in our Galaxy’s history provides potential observational support for the theory of hierarchical black hole mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for the space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in the 2030s.
Most of a galaxy’s mass is located beyond its stellar component, spread out to hundreds of kiloparsecs. This diffuse reservoir of gas, the circumgalactic medium, acts as the interface between a galaxy and the cosmic web that connects galaxies. We present kiloparsec-scale-resolution integral field spectroscopy of emission lines that trace cool ionized gas from the centre of a nearby galaxy to 30 kpc into its circumgalactic medium. We find a smooth surface brightness profile with a break in slope at twice the 90% stellar radius. The gas also changes from being photoionized by Hiistar-forming regions in the disk to being ionized by shocks or the extragalactic UV background at greater distances. This transition represents the boundary between the interstellar medium and the circumgalactic medium, revealing how the dominant reservoir of baryonic matter directly connects to its galaxy.
Phenomenological models of quantum gravity often consider the existence of some form of minimal length. This feature is commonly described in the context of quantum mechanics and using the corresponding formalism and techniques. Although few attempts at a quantum field-theoretical description of a minimal length has been proposed, they are rather the exception and there is no general agreement on the correct one. Here, using the quantum-mechanical model as a guidance, we propose a first-principle definition of a quantum field theory including a minimal length. Specifically, we propose a two-step procedure, by first describing the quantum-mechanical models as a classical field theory and subsequently quantizing it. We are thus able to provide a foundation for further exploration of the implications of a minimal length in quantum field theory.
We examine bulk viscosity, taking into account trapped neutrinos in baryonic matter, in the context of binary neutron star mergers. Following the merging event, the binary star can yield a remnant compact object with densities up to 5 nuclear saturation density and temperature up to 50 MeV resulting in the retention of neutrinos. We employ two relativistic mean field models, NL3 and DDME2, to describe the neutrino-trapped baryonic matter. The dissipation coefficient is determined by evaluating the Modified URCA interaction rate in the dense baryonic medium, and accounting for perturbations caused by density oscillations. We observe the resonant behavior of bulk viscosity as it varies with the temperature of the medium. The bulk viscosity peak remains within the temperature range of\(\sim 13\)–50 MeV, depending upon the underlying equation of states and lepton fractions. This temperature range corresponds to the relevant domain of binary neutron star mergers. We also note that in presence of neutrinos in the medium the bulk viscosity peak shifts towards higher temperature and the peak value of bulk viscosity also changes. The time scale of viscous dissipation is dictated by the beta-off-equilibrium susceptibilities derived from the nuclear equation of state. The resulting viscous decay time scale ranges from 32–100 ms, which aligns with the order of magnitude of the post-merger object’s survival time in some specific scenarios.
We take the Dyson–Schwinger Equation approach of QCD for the quark propagator at complex chemical potential to study the QCD phase transition. The phase transition line of the\((2+1)\)-flavor QCD matter in the imaginary chemical potential region is computed via a simplified truncation scheme, whose curvature is found to be consistent with the one at real chemical potential. Moreover, the computation in the complex chemical potential plane allows us to determine the location of the Lee–Yang edge singularities. We show explicitly that the critical end point coincides with the Lee–Yang edge singularities on the real\(\mu _{B} \)axis. We also investigate the scaling behavior of the singularities and discuss the possibility of extrapolating the CEP from a certain range of chemical potential.
The Polynomial Affine Gravity is an alternative gravitational model, where the interactions are mediated solely by the affine connection, instead of the metric tensor. In this paper, we explore the space of solutions to the field equations when the torsion fields are turned on, in a homogeneous and isotropic (cosmological) scenario. We explore various metric structures that emerge in the space of solutions.
Fixed-point equations in the functional renormalization group approach are integrated from large to vanishing field, where an asymptotic potential in the limit of large field is implemented as initial conditions. This approach allows us to obtain a global fixed-point potential with high numerical accuracy, that incorporates the correct asymptotic behavior in the limit of large field. Our calculated global potential is in good agreement with the Taylor expansion in the region of small field, and it also coincides with the Laurent expansion in the regime of large field. Laurent expansion of the potential in the limit of large field for general case, that the spatial dimensiondis a continuous variable in the range\(2\le d \le 4\), is obtained. Eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of perturbations near the Wilson–Fisher fixed point are computed with the method of eigenperturbations. Critical exponents for different values ofdandNof theO(N) universality class are calculated.
Recent observation of Sagittarius A\(^*\)(Sgr A\(^*\)) by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration has uncovered various unanswered questions in black hole (BH) physics. Besides, it may also probe various beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. One of the most profound possibilities is the search for ultralight bosons (ULBs) using BH superradiance (SR). EHT observations imply that Sgr A\(^*\)has a non-zero spin. Using this observation, we derive bounds on the mass of ULBs with purely gravitational interactions. Considering self-interacting ultralight axions, we constrain new regions in the parameter space of decay constant, for a certain spin of Sgr A\(^*\). Future observations of various spinning BHs can improve the present constraints on ULBs.
We propose a scheme for the quantum metrology of the Schwinger effect and the dynamics of Gaussian interference power (GIP). The ongoing reliability of the estimation strategy for the probe state prepared in particle–particle modes is demonstrated. Although the GIP sensitively depends on the strength of the external electric field and the transverse momentum, the advantage of quantum parameter estimation is still maintained even in the limit of an infinite electric field and zero transverse momentum. It is shown that the entanglement between the particle–particle modes provides a guarantee for obtaining higher precision for the black-box estimation. In contrast, for the probe state prepared in particle–antiparticle modes, the advantage of quantum parameter estimation can also be ensured even though there is no entanglement in the probe state. Put differently, some non-entanglement quantum correlations play the role of quantum resources in the estimation for particle–antiparticle modes.
Unlike the Solar System planets, thousands of smaller bodies beyond Neptune orbit the Sun on eccentric (e> 0.1 andi> 3°) orbits. While migration of the giant planets during the early stages of Solar System evolution could have induced substantial scattering of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), this process cannot account for the small number of distant TNOs (rp> 60 au) outside the planets’ reach. The alternative scenario of the close flyby of another star can instead produce all these TNO features simultaneously, but the possible parameter space for such an encounter is vast. Here we compare observed TNO properties with thousands of flyby simulations to determine the specific properties of a flyby that reproduces all the different dynamical TNO populations, their locations and their relative abundances, and find that a\(0.{8}_{-0.1}^{+0.1}\,{M}_{\odot }\)star passing at a distance ofrp= 110 ± 10 au, inclined byi= 70°\({\,}_{-10}^{+5}\), gives a near-perfect match. This flyby also replicates the retrograde TNO population, which has proved difficult to explain. Such a flyby is reasonably frequent; at least 140 million solar-type stars in the Milky Way are likely to have experienced a similar one. In light of these results, we predict that the upcoming Vera Rubin telescope will reveal that distant and retrograde TNOs are relatively common.
We present the first complete simulation framework for the simulation of jet production in diffractive events at next-to leading order in QCD, matched to the parton shower. We validate the implementation in the SHERPA event generator with data from the H1 and ZEUS experiments for diffractive DIS and diffractive photoproduction. For the latter, we review different models aiming to explain the observed factorisation breaking and we argue that at NLO the direct component must also be suppressed. We provide predictions for diffractive jet production both in DIS and in photoproduction events for the upcoming EIC.
The coherent production of vector mesons in photon–hadron interactions is considered one of the most promising observables to probe the QCD dynamics at high energies and the transverse spatial distribution of the gluons in the hadron wave function. In this paper, we perform an exploratory study about the dependence of the transverse momentum distributions,\(d\sigma /dt\), on the model assumed for the proton density profile. We consider a set of non-Gaussian profiles and include them in the forward dipole–proton scattering amplitude associated with the IP-sat model. We demonstrate that the predictions for\(d\sigma /dt\)are similar in the HERA kinematical range, but are very distinct for values oftthat will be probed in future colliders. In particular, the presence of diffractive dips in thet-distributions associated with the production of\(J/\Psi \)and\(\rho \)mesons is strongly dependent on the model assumed for the density profile. Similar conclusions are also derived when the non-linear effects on the dipole–target interaction are disregarded. Our results indicate that a future study of the coherent vector meson production at large-twill be useful to constrain the spatial distribution of gluons within the proton.
In this work, we apply the formalism of dynamical systems to analyze the viability of the\(\Lambda \)CDM model in a generalized form of the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity theory written in terms of its dynamically equivalent scalar–tensor representation. Adopting a matter distribution composed of two relativistic fluids described by the equations of state of radiation and pressureless dust, one verifies that the cosmological phase space features the usual curvature-dominated, radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, and exponentially accelerated fixed points, even in the absence of a dark energy component. A numerical integration of the dynamical equations describing the system, subjected to initial conditions consistent with the cosmographic observations from the Planck satellite and weak-field solar system dynamics, shows that cosmological solutions mimicking the behavior of the\(\Lambda \)CDM model in General Relativity (GR) are attainable in this theory, with the deviations from GR being exponentially suppressed at early-times and the scalar-field potential effectively playing the role of dark energy at late times.
This research deals with the impacts of Rastall parameter on the physical behavior of isotropic compact stars. For this purpose, the static spherically symmetric as well as perfect fluid distribution are taking into account. To examine the various aspects of some particular compact star models, the Durgapal-Fuloria metric functions are considered. The unknown parameters involved in Durgapal-Fuloria metric functions are computed via matching constraints with observed choices of masses and radii of few particular stellar objects. The viability of the endorsed functions is inspected through the graphical description of matter contents, energy constraints, equation of state factor, mass constituents, causality condition and stellar equation for certain values of Rastall parameter. It is determined that the stars under consideration manifest stable structures corresponding to Durgapal-Fuloria metric potentials in this framework. Further, it is exhibited that for Rastall factor equals to zero, the general results of theory of relativity can be achieved.
The strong cosmic censorship conjecture (SCCC) requires that spacetime cannot be extended beyond the Cauchy horizon. This ensures the predictability of spacetime. In this paper, we investigate the SCCC for a spherically symmetric charged de-Sitter black hole surrounded by dark matter using classical and quantum scalar fields. At the classical level, we analyze the behavior of scalar waves near the Cauchy horizon using the method developed by Hintz and Vasy. We find a relationship between the Sobolev regularity of scalar waves and the spectral gap of quasinormal modes. In the nearly extremal region, this may lead to a violation of the SCCC. At the quantum level, we first provide a proof of the renormalizability of the quantum scalar field in dark-matter black holes. Using numerical methods, we then demonstrate that the renormalized quantum stress-energy tensor for any Hadamard state exhibits quadratic divergence near the Cauchy horizon in the nearly extremal region. The quadratic divergence of the renormalized quantum stress-energy tensor is sufficient to convert the Cauchy horizon into a singularity. Thus, the SCCC is preserved by quantum effects. Since the quadratic divergence is more singular than the behavior of classical scalar field perturbations near the Cauchy horizon, it means there is a region where physics is dominated by quantum effects. We study the influence of dark matter on quantum effects in this region and we find there is a monotonic relationship between the dark matter and the strength of quantum effects. The numerical results show that the quantum effects will become stronger as dark matter increases.
We study interacting classical magnetic and pseudoscalar fields in frames of the axion electrodynamics. A large scale pseudoscalar field can be the coherent superposition of axions or axion like particles. We consider the evolution of these fields inside a spherical clump. Decomposing the magnetic field into the poloidal and toroidal components, we take into account their symmetry properties. Within a spherical clump, we use a thin layer approximation in the induction and Klein–Gordon equations, where the dependence of the fields on the latitude is accounted for. Then, we derive the dynamo equations in the low mode approximation. The nonlinear evolution equations for the harmonics of the magnetic and pseudoscalar fields are solved numerically. As an application, we consider a dense axion star embedded in solar plasma. The behavior of the harmonics and their typical oscillations frequencies are obtained. We suggest that such small size axionic objects, containing oscillating magnetic fields, can cause electromagnetic flashes, recently observed in the solar corona, contributing to the corona heating.
Quarkonium production in ultra-relativistic collisions plays a crucial role in probing the existence of hot QCD matter. This study explores quarkonia states dissociation and regeneration in the hot QCD medium while considering momentum anisotropy. The net quarkonia decay width (\(\Gamma _{D}\)) arises from two essential processes: collisional damping and gluonic dissociation. The quarkonia regeneration includes the transition from octet to singlet states within the anisotropic medium. Our study utilizes a medium-modified potential that incorporates anisotropy via particle distribution functions. This modified potential gives rise to collisional damping for quarkonia due to the surrounding medium, as well as the transition of quarkonia from singlet to octet states due to interactions with gluons. Furthermore, we employ the detailed balance approach to investigate the regeneration of quarkonia within this medium. Our comprehensive analysis spans various temperature settings, transverse momentum values, and anisotropic strengths. Notably, we find that, in addition to medium temperatures and heavy quark transverse momentum, anisotropy significantly influences the dissociation and regeneration of various quarkonia states.
In the following work, a new hybrid model of the form\( f(Q)=Q(1+a)+b\frac{Q_0^2}{Q} \)has been proposed and confronted using both early as well as late-time constraints. We first use conditions from the era of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) in order to constrain the models which are further used to study the evolution of the Universe through the deceleration parameter. This methodology is employed for the hybrid model as well as a simple model of the form\( \alpha _1 Q+\alpha _2 Q_0 \)which is found to reduce to\(\Lambda \)CDM. The error bar plot for the Cosmic Chronometer (CC) and Pantheon+SH0ES datasets which includes the comparison with\(\Lambda \)CDM, has been studied for the constrained hybrid model. Additionally, we perform a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling of the model against three datasets – CC, Pantheon+SH0ES, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) to find the best-fit ranges of the free parameters. It is found that the constraint range of the model parameter (a) from the BBN study has a region of overlap with the ranges obtained from the MCMC analysis. Finally, we perform a statistical comparison between our model and the\(\Lambda \)CDM model using AIC and BIC method.
Information about the three-dimensional description of the quark and gluon content of hadrons, described by the generalized parton distributions (GPDs), can be probed by exclusive processes in electron–proton (ep) collisions. In this letter, we investigate the timelike Compton scattering (TCS) inepcollisions at the future electron-ion collider (EIC). Such process is characterized by the exclusive dilepton production through the subprocess\(\gamma p \rightarrow \gamma ^*p \rightarrow l^+ l^- p\), with the real photon in the initial state being emitted by the incoming electron. Assuming a given model for the GPDs, the TCS differential cross-section is estimated, as well the contribution associated to the interference between the TCS and Bethe–Heitler (BH) amplitudes. Predictions for the TCS, BH and interference contributions are presented considering the kinematical range expected to be covered by the EIC detectors. Moreover, the polarized photon asymmetry is also studied. Our results indicated that a future experimental analysis, considering photon circular polarizations, can be useful to probe the interference contribution and constrain the description of the GPDs for the proton.
In the last decade a quasi-particle model (QPM) has supplied the basis for the study of heavy quark (HQ) production in ultra-relativistic collisions, allowing for a phenomenological estimate of the HQ diffusion coefficient\(D_s(T)\). Using the new lattice QCD results for the equation of state (EoS) with 2+1+1 dynamical flavors, we extend the QPM from\(N_f=2+1\)to\(N_f=2+1+1\), where the charm quark is included. Fixing the couplingg(T) by a fit to the lQCD energy density\(\epsilon (T)\), we evaluate the impact of different temperature parametrizations of charm quark mass on EoS and susceptibilities\(\chi _q(T)\)of light,\(\chi _s(T)\)of strange and\(\chi _c(T)\)of charm quarks, the last favouring a charm quark mass increasing toward\(T_c\). We also explore the extension of the QPM to a more realistic approach called QPM\(_p\), where quark and gluon masses explicitly depend on their momentum converging to the current quark mass at high momenta, as expected from asymptotic free dynamics. The QPM\(_p\)allows for a simultaneous quantitative description not only of the EoS but also of the quark susceptibilities (\(\chi _q(T)\),\(\chi _s(T)\)), which instead are underestimated in the simple QPM. Furthermore, evaluating the spatial diffusion coefficient\(2\pi T D_s(T)\)in the QPM\(_p\), we find it is also closer than QPM to the recent lQCD data performed including dynamical fermions. Finally, in a 1+1D expanding system, we evaluate the\(R_{AA}(p_T)\)in the QPM and QPM\(_p\), finding a significant reduction at low momenta for QPM\(_p\)which could lead in a realistic scenario to a better agreement to experimental data.
We study the one-loop prediction for the single production of a SM-like Higgs boson in association with a photon in electron-positron collisions in the context of the two Higgs doublet type-II seesaw model (2HDMcT). We explore to what extent the new scalars in the 2HDMcT spectrum affect its production cross-section, the ratio\(R_{\gamma h_1}\)as well as the signal strengths\(R_{\gamma Z}\)and\(R_{\gamma \gamma }\)when\(h_1\)is identified with the observed SM Higgs boson within the 2HDMcT delimited parameter space. More specifically, we focus on\(e^+e^- \rightarrow h_1\gamma \)process at one-loop, and analyzed how it evolves under a full set of theoretical constraints and the available experimental data, including\(B\rightarrow X_s\gamma \)limit at 95\(\%\)C.L. Our analysis shows that these observables are strongly dependent on the parameters of the model, especially the mixing angel\(\alpha _1\), the potential parameters\(\lambda _{7}\),\(\lambda _{9}\), the trilinear Higgs couplings, with a noticeable sensitivity to\(\alpha _1\). We found that\(\sigma (e^+e^- \rightarrow h_1\gamma )\)can significantly be enhanced up to\(8.1\,\,\times 10^{-2}\)fb, thus exceeding the Standard Model prediction. Additionally, as a byproduct, we also observed that\(R_{\gamma h_1}\)is entirely correlated with both the\(h_1\rightarrow \gamma \gamma \)and\(h_1\rightarrow \gamma Z\)signal strengths.
There is renewed interest in heliospheric physics following the recent exploration of the pristine solar wind by the Parker Solar Probe. Magnetic switchback structures are frequently observed in the inner heliosphere, but there are open questions about their origin. Many researchers are investigating the statistical properties of switchbacks and their relationships with wave modes, stream types and solar activity, but the sources of switchbacks remain elusive. Here we report that interplanetary switchbacks originate from magnetic reconnection on the Sun that occurs at chromospheric network boundaries and launch solar jet flows. We link in situ interplanetary measurements and remote-sensing solar observations to establish a connection between interplanetary switchbacks and their solar source region, featuring solar jets, chromospheric network boundaries and photospheric magnetic field evolution. Our findings suggest that joint observations of switchbacks and solar jets provide a better estimate of the contribution of magnetic reconnection to coronal heating and solar wind acceleration.
We conduct a model-independent analysis of the distinct signatures of various generic new physics possibilities in the decay\(B \rightarrow K \, \nu \, \overline{\nu }\)by analyzing the branching ratio as well as the missing mass-square distribution. Considering the final neutrinos to be of the same flavor with non-zero mass, we discuss the new physics contributions for both Dirac and Majorana neutrino possibilities. In our study, we utilize the analytical relations among form factors in semi-leptonic\(B \rightarrow K\)transitions, which are consistent with current lattice QCD predictions to a very high numerical accuracy. We provide constraints on different new physics parameters, taking into account the recent measurement of\(B^+ \rightarrow K^+ \, \nu \, \overline{\nu }\)branching ratio by the Belle-II collaboration. In future, if the missing mass-square distribution for\(B^+ \rightarrow K^+ \, \nu \, \overline{\nu }\)decay gets reported by Belle-II with analysis of more events than their present data set, one can not only investigate possible new physics effects in these decays, but also probe the Dirac/Majorana nature of the neutrinos using quantum statistics, since a difference between the two cases is known to exist in the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions.
The production ofBmesons at forward rapidities is strongly sensitive to the behavior of the gluon and bottom distribution functions for small and large values of the Bjorken-xvariable. In this exploratory study, we estimate the cross-section for the\(B^{\pm }\)meson production in the kinematic range probed by the LHCb detector and that will be analyzed by the future Forward Physics Facility (FPF) considering the hybrid formalism, the solution of the running coupling Balitsky–Kovchegov equation and distinct descriptions for the bottom distribution function. We assume an ansatz for the intrinsic bottom component in the proton wave function, and estimate its impact on the transverse momentum, rapidity and Feynman-xdistributions. Our results indicate that the presence of an intrinsic bottom strongly modifies the magnitude of the cross-section at ultra-forward rapidities (\(y \ge 6\)), which implies an enhancement of the\(B^{\pm }\)production at the FPF. Possible implications on the prompt neutrino flux at ultra-high energies are also briefly discussed.
We examine the possibility of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formation in single field models of inflation. Using the adiabatic or wave function renormalization scheme in the short range modes, we show that one-loop correction to the power spectrum is free from quadratic UV divergence. We consider a framework in which PBHs are produced during the transition from Slow Roll (SR) to Ultra Slow Roll (USR) followed by the end of inflation. We demonstrate that the renormalized power spectrum soften the contribution of the logarithmic IR divergence and severely restricts the possible mass range of produced PBHs in the said transition, namely,\(M_\textrm{PBH}\sim 10^{2}\,\textrm{g}\)\(\hat{\textrm{a}}\)laa no-go theorem. In particular, we find that the produced PBHs are short lived (\(t^\textrm{evap}_\textrm{PBH}\sim 10^{-20}\,\textrm{s}\)) and the corresponding number of e-folds in the USR region is restricted to\(\Delta {\mathcal {N}}_\textrm{USR}\approx 2\).
We study the problem of how to derive conformal symmetry in the framework of quantum gravity. We start with a generic gravitational theory which is invariant under both the general coordinate transformation (GCT) and Weyl transformation (or equivalently, local scale transformation), and then construct its BRST formalism by fixing the gauge symmetries by the extended de Donder gauge and scalar gauge conditions. These gauge-fixing conditions are invariant under globalGL(4) and global scale transformations. The gauge-fixed and BRST invariant quantum action possesses a huge Poincaré-likeIOSp(10|10) global symmetry, from which we can construct an extended conformal symmetry in a flat Minkowski background in the sense that the Lorentz symmetry is replaced with theGL(4) symmetry. Moreover, we construct the conventional conformal symmetry out of this extended symmetry. With a flat Minkowski background\(\langle g_{\mu \nu } \rangle = \eta _{\mu \nu }\)and a non-zero scalar field\(\langle \phi \rangle \ne 0\), theGL(4) and global scale symmetries are spontaneously broken to the Lorentz symmetry, thereby proving that the graviton and the dilaton are respectively the corresponding Nambu–Goldstone bosons, and therefore they must be exactly massless at nonperturbative level. One of remarkable aspects in our findings is that in quantum gravity, a derivation of conformal symmetry does not depend on a classical action, and its generators are built from only the gauge-fixing and the FP ghost actions. Finally, we address a generalized Zumino theorem in quantum gravity.
We consider the fragmentation of heavy quarks into heavy-flavoured hadrons, specifically the production of charmed mesons in\(e^+e^-\)collisions, at different centre-of-mass energies. We focus our attention on the ratio of moments of the\(D^{*+}\)energy spectrum measured by ALEPH and CLEO. This ratio is believed to provide us with a direct test of perturbative QCD evolution because hadronisation effects should cancel between the numerator and denominator. However, state-of-the-art calculations based on standard (final-state) collinear factorisation fail to describe the experimental data. We show that this discrepancy is considerably reduced if heavy-quark threshold effects are accounted for not only in DGLAP evolution, as it is usually done, but also in the resummed coefficient functions.
The KM3NeT/ARCA neutrino detector is currently under construction at 3500 m depth offshore Capo Passero, Sicily, in the Mediterranean Sea. The main science objectives are the detection of high-energy cosmic neutrinos and the discovery of their sources. Simulations were conducted for the full KM3NeT/ARCA detector, instrumenting a volume of 1 km\(^3\), to estimate the sensitivity and discovery potential to point-like neutrino sources. This paper covers the reconstruction of track- and shower-like signatures, as well as the criteria employed for neutrino event selection. With an angular resolution below 0.1\(^\circ \)for tracks and under 2\(^\circ \)for showers, the sensitivity to point-like neutrino sources surpasses existing observed limits across the entire sky.

This study presented the first light curve analysis of the OP Boo and V0511 Cam binary stars, which was conducted in the frame of the Binary Systems of South and North (BSN) Project. Photometric ground-based observations were conducted with standard filters at two observatories in the Czech Republic. We computed a new ephemeris for each of the systems using our extracted times of minima, TESS data, and additional literature. Linear fits for O-C diagrams of both systems were considered using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The light curves were analyzed using the Wilson-Devinney (WD) binary code combined with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The light curve solutions of both target systems required a cold starspot. The absolute parameters of the systems were calculated by using aP–Mparameter relationship. The positions of the systems were also depicted on the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR),P-L, logMtot- logJ0, andT-Mdiagrams. The hotter component in both systems is determined to be a more massive star. Therefore, it can be concluded that both systems are W-type contact binary systems.
Reanalyzing contact binaries with space-based photometric data and investigating possible parameter changes can yield accurate samples for theoretical studies. We investigated light curve solutions and fundamental parameters for twenty contact binary systems. The most recent Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data is used to analyze. The target systems in the investigation have an orbital period of less than 0.58 days. Light curve solutions were performed using the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code version 2.4.9. The results show that systems had various mass ratios from q = 0.149 to q = 3.915, fillout factors (the degree of contact) from f = 0.072 to f = 0.566, and inclinations from i = 52°.8 to i = 87°.3. The effective temperature of the stars was less than 7016 K, which was expected given the features of most contact binary stars. Twelve of the target systems' light curves were asymmetrical in the maxima, showing the O'Connell effect, and a starspot was required for light curve solutions. The estimation of the absolute parameters of the binary systems was presented using the a - P empirical relationship and discussed. The orbital angular momentum J0of the systems was calculated. The positions of the systems were also depicted on the M - L, M - R, q - Lratio, Mtot- J0, and T - M diagrams.
We report on the discovery of three large diffuse dwarf (LDD) galaxies located in isolated triple systems. They have effective diameters of 3.6 ÷ 10.0 kpc and effective surface brightness of 26.2 ÷ 27.3m/sq. arcsec. We note that the LDD galaxies tend to occur in small groups with a very low dispersion of radial velocities. The total (orbital) mass of the triplets approximately equals to their integral stellar mass within velocity measurement errors. The presence of LDD galaxies in cold multiple systems seems mysterious.
Recently a data set containing linear and circular polarisation information of a collection of six hundred pulsars has been released. The operative radio wavelength for the same was 21 cm. Pulsars radio emission process is modelled either with synchroton/superconducting self-Compton route or with curvature radiation route. These theories fall short of accounting for the circular polarisation observed, as they are predisposed towards producing, solely, linear polarisation. Here we invoke (pseudo)scalars and their interaction with photons mediated by colossal magnetic fields of pulsars, to account for the circular part of polarisation data. This enables us to estimate the pseudoscalar parameters such as its coupling to photons and its mass in conjunction as product. To obtain these values separately, we turn our attention to recent observation on 47 pulsars, whose absolute polarisation position angles have been made available. Except, a third of the latter set, the rest of it overlaps with the expansive former data set on polarisation type and degree. This helps us figure out, both the pseudoscalar parameters individually, that we report here.
AbstractWe continue to study the ultra-luminous X-ray source NGC 7793 P13 in the optical range. In this work, we are testing the model of a spherically symmetric wind atmosphere of the donor star, previously identified as a B9 Ia supergiant. The model spectrum has shown good agreement with the observed one at a relatively high mass loss rate of\(\dot{M}\approx 6\times 10^{-6}M_{\odot}\text{ yr}^{-1}\); other parameters turned out to be close to those expected for late B-supergiants. The increased mass loss rate can be explained by the high rotation velocity of the star. In addition, we have qualitatively demonstrated the effect of X-ray irradiation on the observed spectrum and discuss the fundamental possibility of wind acceleration under conditions of powerful irradiation.
AbstractUsing a previously developed technique, a study of moderate-resolution optical spectra was carried out, and sets of parameters for the dwarf novae V355 UMa, V521 Peg, VY Aqr, and PQ And were obtained. Observations of the systems in late relaxation state after a burst or in a quiescent state were carried out in 2020 and 2021 with the 6-m BTA telescope of SAO RAS. Their analysis took into account the requirement for an optimum description of the observed absorption profiles of the Balmer series lines with the model spectra of white dwarfs with radiative and convective transfer. As a result, the atmospheric parameters of the primaries were determined for all the systems, and when they were subsequently compared with models of the internal structure of white dwarf and main-sequence stars, sets of fundamental parameters of the objects were also determined. It has been established that analysis of the spectra of dwarf novae containing moderately cool white dwarfs with\(T_{\textrm{eff}}=12000{-}15000\)K provides better accuracy of their parameters than systems with hotter primaries. A simultaneous condition to be fulfilled for increasing accuracy is to carry out observations after the objects relax to a quiescent state, since the emission lines of the accretion disk significantly narrow the region of the analyzed spectrum. It has been found that the primary components of V355 UMa, V521 Peg, VY Aqr, and PQ And have masses within the range of\(M_{1}=0.59{-}0.87\)\(M_{\odot}\), and their cool companions are red dwarfs with\(M_{2}=0.11{-}0.13\)\(M_{\odot}\).
We consider plane symmetric gravitational fields within the framework of General Relativity in (D+1)-dimensional spacetime. Two classes of vacuum solutions correspond to higher-dimensional generalizations of the Rindler and Taub spacetimes. The general solutions are presented for a positive and negative cosmological constant as the only source of the gravity. Matching conditions on a planar boundary between two regions with distinct plane symmetric metric tensors are discussed. An example is considered with Rindler and Taub geometries in neighboring half-spaces. As another example, we discuss a finite thickness cosmological constant slab embedded into the Minkowski, Rindler and Taub spacetimes. The corresponding surface energy-momentum tensor is found required for matching the exterior and interior geometries.
As examples of applying the formulas from part I we examine scattering in a one-dimensional medium for which all the characteristics of the radiative field are expressed in terms of elementary functions and (three-dimensional) isotropic monochromatic scattering. Some properties of the Ambartsumyan function are studied and the asymptotes of the average numbers of photon scattering events in an optically thick plane layer are derived.
Observational evidence consistently shows that the universe is spatially flat and undergoes Lorentzian time dilation as a function of redshift. In combination, such discoveries suggest that a Minkowskian description of cosmology might be technically viable. The thermal evolution that transpires in a conformal spacetime is herein derived. The description is constrained by the energy conservation of a unified cosmic fluid. The resulting model puts forth a Lorentzian correction for the temperature of the CMB as a function of redshift, which improves current data fitting without adding any free parameter. Furthermore, it sheds light upon the early galaxy formation problem: our model predicts up to 0.86 Gyr older objects within the first two billion years of the structure evolution in the universe.
Shocks are ubiquitous in astrophysical environments, and particle acceleration at such astrophysical shocks is related to high-energy phenomena. In particular, the acceleration mechanism and the time evolution of the particle distribution function have been extensively examined. This paper describes a simple analytic method using the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation in the test-particle regime. We aim to investigate the evolution of the particle distribution function in the shock upstream, which could be streaming toward Earth along the open magnetic field geometry. The behavior of the analytical solution is examined over a wide range of parameters representing shock structure, such as the shock Mach number, plasma beta, injection fraction into diffusive shock acceleration, and the scale of the upstream magnetic field. The behavior is associated with upstream turbulence for diffusive shock acceleration, as expected. Additionally, pre-accelerated particles could affect the time evolution of the particle distribution only when the radiative or advection losses are small enough for the pre-accelerated distribution to have a flatter power-law slope than the power-law slope based on shock acceleration theory. We also provide a formula for a spherically expanding shock and its relevant application to calculate high-energy emission due to hadronic interactions. We suggest that the simple analytic method could be applied to examine astrophysical shocks with a wide range of plasma parameters.
AbstractWe present an analysis of the relative abundance features of a number of chemical elements in the atmospheres of metal-rich (\({\textrm{[Fe/H]}}>-1\)) Galactic-field RR Lyrae variable stars and the kinematic characteristics of these stars. We have previously shown that the relative abundances of some\(\alpha\)elements: magnesium, silicon, calcium, and to a greater extent of titanium, as well as yttrium and scandium in such stars are lower than in most other types of stars bearing similar metallicity. It is found here that some of these metal-rich RR Lyrae stars also have very low relative abundances of sodium, aluminum, and nickel. The orbital parameters of all the metal-rich RR Lyrae variables studied in this paper are typical of the Galactic thin or thick disk objects, however, the unusual chemical composition let us to suggest a possible extragalactic origin for some of them.
AbstractThe rest wavelengths of diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are parameters of fundamental importance owing to the lack of unambiguous identification for these mysterious features. Usually the wavelengths of DIBs are estimated using known interstellar atomic or molecular lines serving to shift the spectrum to the rest wavelengths velocity scale. However, the latter may not share in fact the same parts of a cloud which the carriers of diffuse bands occupy. Here we argue that the narrowest known diffuse interstellar band 6196 Å is the best reference feature for building the ‘‘interstellar’’ wavelength scale. Also, we offer the geometrical center of gravity (the effective wavelength) of the diffuse bands as a rest wavelength measurer for these generally asymmetric features. We assessed the magnitude of variation of the center of gravity of the diffuse bands at 5780, 5797, 6284, and 7224 Å measured in 41 lines of sight in the broad range of interstellar reddening (\(E_{B-V}\)varies in the range of 0.13–1.06 stellar magnitudes) with the lack of evident Doppler-split in the profiles of interstellar atomic/molecular lines. We demonstrated that diffuse bands show gradual broadening of their profile widths, accompanied with the red-shift of the center of gravity, i.e., the red wing of the profiles is their most variable part. To estimate the width of the diffuse bands, we offer to apply an ‘‘effective width’’ parameter\(W_{\textrm{eff}}\), which is the relation of the equivalent width (\(EW\)) to the depth of the feature. In contrast to habitual half width at half maximum (\(FWHM\)), the parameter originally introduced by us in 2008 (Galazutdinov, LoCurto, Krełowski) is not sensitive to the profile shape irregularities.\(W_{\textrm{eff}}\)provides lower measurement uncertainties than the\(FWHM\)does. The gradual increase of\(W_{\textrm{eff}}\), accompanied with the red-shift of the center of gravity of the profile, may suggest populating of higher transitions of the P branch of the bands of molecules, assuming the latter are DIB carriers. It is also shown, that diffuse bands are broader although more shallow in the harsh conditions of\(\sigma\)-clouds, where atomic and molecular lines are weakened and/or totally absent. The difference of the effective width of DIBs in\(\zeta\)and\(\sigma\)clouds is discussed as well.
AbstractIn this paper, we study the fractal properties of the stellar medium in the solar vicinity based on the Gaia DR2 data for 200 000 stars of all spectral types at distances from 1 to 100 pc from the Sun. We consider the main stages of the development of ideas about the fractal structure in the stellar medium of galaxies. Analysis of the spatial distribution of stars is performed using by the ‘‘mass–radius’’ method. Numerical calculations show that the mean conditional local stellar density in spheres with the increasing radius\(r\)with the center in the\(i\)-th star is approximated by power laws, which confirms the de Vaucouleurs–Mandelbrot conclusions for fractal structures in gravitating media and indicates the presence of fractal structures in the stellar medium in the solar neighborhood with the fractal dimension\(D\simeq 2.41\). The characteristics of the fractal properties of the medium, determined from a sample of 200 000 stars, are discussed and compared with an earlier result obtained for 13 000 F and G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood according to the Geneva–Copenhagen survey.
Accurate collisional rate coefficients for collisional transitions between 15 rotational levels of methanimine, colliding with p-H2molecule, are available. Methanimine is a planar, asymmetric top molecule having electric dipole moment with components μa= 1.3396 Debye and μb= 1.4461 Debye, and thus, producing both the a and b type spectral lines of nearly equal intensities. Therefore, all the rotational levels need to be considered together. Between 15 rotational levels, 105 collisional transitions are considered in an investigation by others. We have discussed that each level is not connected with all others through the collisions, and therefore, there should be 77 instead of 105 collisional transitions between 15 levels of methanimine. With availability of accurate collisional rate coefficients, it is worth to perform the Sobolev analysis of methanimine. We have found six weak MASER transitions, 110-111, 211-212, 312-313, 41.3-41.4, 303-212and 40.4-31.3, and one transition 111-202, showing anomalous absorption. These seven lines may play important role for the methanimine.
AbstractThe kinematics of the young stellar association near the Sun TW Hya is studied. Kinematic estimates of the age of this association were obtained in two ways. The first method—the analysis of stellar trajectories integrated back in time—gave an estimate of the age\(t=4.9\pm 1.2\)Myr. The second was to analyze the instantaneous velocities of the stars; it showed that there was a volume expansion of the stellar system with the angular velocity coefficient\(K_{xyz}=103\pm 12\)km s\({}^{-1}\)kpc\({}^{-1}\). Based on this effect, the time that passed from the beginning of the expansion of the TW Hya association to the present moment was found,\(t=9.5\pm 1.1\)Myr. The following principal semi-axes of the residual velocity ellipsoid were determined:\(\sigma_{1,2,3}=(5.25,1.84,0.35)\pm(0.34,0.63,0.26)\)km s\({}^{-1}\).
AbstractThe stellar and integral photometry of 30 irregular dwarf galaxies was performed in the\(F606W\)(\(V\)) and\(F814W\)(\(I\)) filters based on archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope. Distances were determined for 12 galaxies using the TRGB method. Branches of blue supergiants were identified on the plotted Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams, and the average luminosities of the three brightest stars were calculated. The color indices\((V-I)\)and luminosities of galaxies in the\(V\)and\(I\)filters were determined in circular apertures with the maximum radius\(\textrm{Rad}=50^{\prime\prime}\). A diagram of the dependence between the luminosities of galaxies and their brightest stars was developed, which shows that the luminosity of the brightest stars increases with increasing luminosity of the parent galaxies. A comparison of the dependence for 30 irregular galaxies with a similar one for 150 spiral and irregular galaxies, published by Tikhonov et al. in 2021, shows their similarity. This result confirms the hypothesis that the absence of bright massive stars in dwarf irregular galaxies cannot be explained by the small number of stars in these galaxies. Using the results of Hunter et al. (2019 and 2021), we developed a dependence between the luminosity of galaxies and the mass of the third-largest H I cloud of these galaxies. The presented correlation, as well as the well-known Larson correlation proposed in 1982, between the mass of molecular hydrogen clouds and the mass of stars born in them, give us reason to conclude that the dependence between the luminosity of galaxies and the brightest stars is a consequence of the correlation between the luminosity (mass) of galaxies and the average mass of the gaseous clouds of these galaxies.
AbstractCas 1 is a Local Volume (LV) dIr. In 2019 Tikhonov, using HST images and the Tip of Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method, derived its distance\(D=1.61\pm 0.1\)Mpc and determined the stellar metallicity of Cas 1,\(z=0.0004\)(or\(Z_{\textrm{stars}}=Z_{\odot}/50\)). Such an eXtremely Metal-Poor (XMP) dwarf would be a nearby analogue of I Zw 18 and a valuable object for the follow-up detailed studies. Meanwhile, the distance to Cas 1 remains debatable. Its TRGB distance of\(4.5\pm 0.2\)Mpc, based on the deeper HST images, was presented in the Extragalactic Distance Database (EDD). It places Cas 1 in the field between groups of IC 342 (\(D=3.3\)Mpc) and Maffei 1/Maffei 2 (\(D=5.7\)Mpc). To test the suggested XMP nature of Cas 1, we conduct the 6-m telescope (BTA, SAO RAS) spectroscopy to estimate O/H in its two H II regions. We also use these spectra to derive, via the observed Balmer decrements, the upper limit of the MW extinction in Cas 1. The derived values of\(12+\log(\textrm{O/H})\)are\(7.83\pm 0.1\)and\(7.58\pm 0.1\)dex. The measured Balmer decrements result in the upper limit MW extinction in this direction of\(A_{B}=3\overset{\textrm{m}}{.}06\pm 0\overset{\textrm{m}}{.}14\). This is smaller by\(0\overset{\textrm{m}}{.}63\)than\(A_{B}\), used in the previous estimates of the distance to Cas 1. This reduces the original EDD distance to\(4.1\pm 0.36\)Mpc. We use the LV galaxies relationship between their\(12+\log(\textrm{O/H})\)and blue absolute magnitude,\(M_{B}\), published by Berg et al. in 2012, to restrict\(M_{B}\)for Cas 1. The related distance estimate to Cas 1 is 1.64 Mpc with the 1\(\sigma\)uncertainty of a factor of 2.17. From obtained here\(Z({\textrm{gas}})\sim Z_{\odot}/10\), we conclude that Cas 1 is not an XMP dwarf. Its newly derived distances are consistent with each other within 1\(\sigma\)errors, with the likely distance of about 3.73 Mpc. This distance favors Cas 1 to reside in the environs of IC 342, but not in the field.
AbstractThe paper presents and analyzes a summary of magnetometric studies of single white dwarfs (WD) conducted at SAO RAS jointly with a number of other observatories. The goals of the studies are to search for regular large-scale magnetic fields in these stars and to construct a probability distribution of WD occurrence depending on the strength of these fields. Based on the analysis, the WDs were determined whose magnetospheres do not change their configurations for a long time, from several tens to hundreds of years at least, and possibly more. These stars can be used as standards of circular polarization. Using data from modern surveys and SAO RAS observations, versions of the observed probability distributions of WDs by their surface magnetic fields in the range of\(10^{3}{-}10^{9}\)G were constructed. The distribution of WDs with fields from\(10^{6}\)G to\(10^{9}\)G is well described by a power-law dependence. In the region of smaller fields the dependence is violated, demonstrating a selection ‘‘dip’’. The selection is caused by the technical complexity of magnetometric studies of WDs. The paper also discusses the physical nature of the selection associated with the complication of the interaction of global magnetic fields of low intensity (less than 10 kG) with dynamic processes in the surface layers of WDs. In particular, convection is capable of destroying the global symmetry of the surface magnetic field with an intensity of several kilogauss. Based on the analysis of the obtained distributions, it is concluded that all WDs with surface fields above several tens of kilogauss are carriers of regular global fields damped on times of\(10^{10}\)years. Magnetic fields with intensities of several kilogauss and lower lose their global structure, fragmenting into spots, which complicates and even makes impossible their detection by standard spectropolarimetric methods. Confirming examples and recommendations for improving the methodology of magnetometric observations of degenerate stars with weak magnetic fields are given.
AbstractThis paper is devoted to studying the variability of the\(\gamma\)Cas variable star SAO 49725. We analyze both the optical and X-ray spectra of the star. The line profile variability in the spectrum of SAO 49725 was discovered on short (70–223 minutes) scales. Regular variations of the SAO 49725 light curves with a period of 1.1989 days are detected using the photometric light curves obtained with the TESS satellite, identified with the rotation period of the star. The pattern of the photometric variability of SAO 49725 according to the TESS data significantly varies at different observational epochs. The TESS components of the SAO 49725 light curves with the periods of about\(3{-}21\)days may be instrumental. The presence of variations with the period\(P=230\pm 178\)minutes in the SAO 49725 X-ray light curves, obtained by the XMM-Newton telescope, is suspected.
AbstractThe structure of sound waves in baryonic gas generated during the evolution of spherically symmetric dark matter halos with a mass less than the Jeans mass has been calculated. In this case, the source of the gravitational field that creates the wave can be at both the linear stage (evolving perturbation in dark matter) and the nonlinear stage (separated and virialized object). Peculiar motions of baryons in a sound wave in the second order in speed cause the absorption of relict radiation in the 21 cm line. It is shown that this additional absorption on sound waves is a fraction of a percent at redshifts\(z\sim 15{-}20\)of the absorption value in the model of a homogeneous Universe, however, the additional absorption can be larger in the case of a non-standard spectrum of cosmological perturbations of matter density on small scales.
AbstractWe have selected candidate massive stars in the galaxy IC 342 based on archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope and images from the 2-m telescope at the National Astronomical Observatory, Rozhen, Bulgaria. Spectral observations of 24 out of 27 selected stars are carried out with the 6-m BTA telescope of SAO RAS and with the 3.5-m Apache Point Observatory telescope (USA) as part of the program for searching for bright massive stars in galaxies outside the Local Group. Our analysis reveals that 12 objects have spectra lacking prominent features, except for the emission lines of the surrounding nebulae and are identified as single supergiants of classes O9 to F5 or spatially unresolved young compact clusters. One source with an absorption spectrum probably belongs to our Galaxy. The spectra of seven other objects show features typical of Wolf–Rayet stars or compact clusters containing Wolf–Rayet stars. Another source is a compact supernova remnant. Two other objects are tentatively classified as cold LBV candidates, and one object is classified as a B[e]-supergiant candidate.
AbstractThe spectroscopic material obtained from 2015 to 2021 for the young Herbig Ae star HD 179218 is described and analyzed. The profiles of the H\(\beta\)and He I\(\lambda 5876\)lines and their variability on different time scales are studied. Analysis of the observation results showed that the profiles of the H\(\beta\)line in the spectrum of HD 179218 have the shape of a single emission component with local absorption features superimposed on it, the radial velocities of which vary from the blue to the red edge of the emission. On certain dates, one can simultaneously observe several components persisting for at least three days. Over 17 observation dates, the H\(\beta\)and He I\(\lambda 5876\)line profiles looked like the inverse profile of P Cyg, the red boundary of which\(v_{\textrm{red}}\)varied from date to date from\(+235\)to\(+390\)km s\({}^{-1}\). Analysis of variations in the parameter\(v_{\textrm{red}}\)for these lines by the Lafleur–Kinman method showed the presence of a regular component with the period\(P=1.341\pm 0.002\)days corresponding to the expected rotation period of the star. The detected variability of HD 179218 may be a sign of magnetospheric accretion. The object’s rotation axis inclination is determined,\(i=23^{\circ}\pm 3^{\circ}\). The pattern of the observed variability of HD 179218 can be explained by the peculiarities of its magnetism.
AbstractThe structure of a solar coronal filament with plasma parameters typical for quiescent solar prominences (particle concentration\(10^{10}{-}10^{12}\)cm\({}^{-3}\)and temperature in the coldest part ranging from 4000 to 20 000 K), located horizontally in the corona at heights of several tens of thousands of kilometers has been calculated. The filament is considered as the upper part of a slightly curved twisted magnetic loop, the legs of which are anchored in the photosphere. The magnetic field of the filament is helical (twisted). To maintain transverse equilibrium, an external longitudinal field is necessary. There is also a weak transverse magnetic field, which has a significant effect on the distribution of pressure and gas density in the filament. A characteristic feature of the model, reproduced theoretically for the first time, is the presence of a rarefaction (cavity) outside the filament. The fine filamentary structure of the prominence, consisting of dense and cold fibrils immersed in a weak uniform horizontal magnetic field, has been modeled. It is shown that the observed vertical movements of plasma elements in the prominence, usually interpreted as manifestations of ‘‘thermal convection’’ in its body, can be due to vertical mechanical displacements of individual magnetic fibrils that make up the body of the prominence. Shear (slip) plasma movements on the photosphere can change the sign of the weak transverse field and thus reduce the plasma density on the filament axis, i.e., bring the density of the electric current on its axis closer to the critical value at which the drift velocity of electrons equals the ion sound speed.
AbstractWe present a refined speckle-interferometric orbit of a binary system\(\mu\)Cet, with the main component studied based on the analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data, obtained with the SAO RAS 6-m telescope. The object was initially classified as a giant with chemical composition anomalies. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the star belongs to the Main Sequence, to the class of non-peculiar stars. Analysis of photometric data from the TESS mission indicates that the main component of the system belongs to the\(\gamma\)Dor pulsators.
A model of a conducting cylinder with a radial temperature gradient which creates an electric field that increases with time in the surrounding vacuum is examined. The conditions under which this model functions are pointed out. An electric field is also generated when a magnetic field exists along the axis of the cylinder. This article discusses the interactions of the thermal flux, magnetic field, and charge distribution. Four models are considered with different conditions for the supply of electrons from a central source and the possibility either of capturing electrons inside the cylinder or their freely leaving it through the outer boundary.
AbstractWe report the results of laboratory studies of the main optical properties of the slitless spectrograph developed for a small telescope with a 0.5 m-diameter primary mirror and a focal ratio of\(1:6.8\). The spectrograph operates in the 450–950 nm wavelength interval and has a field of\(35\overset{\prime}{.}6\times 7\overset{\prime}{.}2\). Its distinctive feature is the use of a composite grism subdivided into two subapertures with independently optimized parameters. Measurements show that the use of such a grism makes it possible to achieve a spectral resolving power\(R\)from 461 to 1041 with the grating diffraction efficiency as high as 45\(\%\). We demonstrate that our solution provides better optical characteristics compared to the classical grism and that our measurements agree well with the results of modeling.
We investigate a symmetric traversable wormhole model, integrating Einstein’s gravitational coupling phantom field and a nonlinear electromagnetic field. This work indicates the emergence of negative ADM mass within a specific parameter range, coinciding with distinct alterations in the wormhole’s spacetime properties. Despite violating the Null Energy Condition (NEC) and other energy conditions, the solution exhibits unique characteristics in certain energy-momentum tensor components, potentially accounting for the manifestation of negative mass.
In this paper, we present analytical solutions to the Einstein field equations for spherically symmetric anisotropic matter distributions using the well-established Tolman VII metric potential, chosen for its strong physical and mathematical foundations. Our solutions are derived using three distinct approaches: the vanishing complexity factor condition (VCC), the embedding class I condition (ECC), and the conformally flat condition (CFC). We conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of these three approaches. By ensuring a smooth match between the interior spacetime metric and the exterior Schwarzschild metric, and applying the condition of vanishing radial pressure at the boundary, we determine the model parameters. We graphically assess the model’s stability by examining conditions such as causality, the adiabatic index, equations of state, and the generalized Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkov (TOV) equation, considering the forces acting within the system. Additionally, the effects of anisotropy on the stars’ physical characteristics are investigated through graphical representations.
Variations at the event horizon structure of a black hole will emit the signals of the gravitational wave echoes associated with the ringdown of the binary black hole merger. In this work, combining mass model of M87 and Einasto profile for dark matter halo, we construct one formal solution of black holes in dark matter halo, and this solution includes the regular black hole for geometric parameter\(a < 2M\)and the wormhole for\(a \ge 2M\). Then, we test this solution under axial gravitational perturbation and calculate their quasinormal modes (QNM). Our results show that when geometric parameter\(a>2M\), a series of gravitational wave echoes appear after the QNM, and one distinctive feature of gravitational wave echoes is the double barrier. Besides, we also study the impacts of shape parameters\(\alpha \)of Einasto profile both on the QNM and gravitational wave echoes, and extract their frequencies using WKB method and Prony method. In principle, with the increasing of shape parameter\(\alpha \), the frequencies of the QNM and gravitational wave echoes between the different shape parameters must be different. But now there is zero difference of the frequencies between shape parameter\(\alpha =0.18\)and\(\alpha =0.20\). Zero difference is not allowed, so we give an upper limit for shape parameter\(\alpha \), which is approximately\(\alpha <0.18\). These signals of gravitational wave echoes in a dark matter halo may be detected in the near future, and these characteristics of gravitational wave echoes may serve as local measurements of dark matter.
Utilizing the holographic dictionary from the proposal that treats Newton’s constant as a thermodynamic variable, we establish a thermodynamic topological equivalence between the AdS black holes in the bulk and the thermal states in the dual CFT. The findings further reveal that the thermodynamic topological characteristics of the RegMax AdS black holes are strongly influenced by the characteristic parameter of the regularized Maxwell theory. Additionally, we investigate the phase transition between low and high entropy thermal states within a canonical ensemble in the dual CFT. Our observations indicate that the phase transition behavior of the thermal states mirrors that of the black holes. By modeling the phase transition process as a stochastic process, we are able to calculate the rates of phase transition between the thermal states. This result enhances our understanding of the dominant processes involved in the phase transition of the thermal states in the dual CFT.
Understanding the polarization property of\(J/\psi \)is critical to constrain its production mechanism. In addition, the polarization of\(J/\psi \)can reveal the impact of strong electromagnetic and vorticity fields in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this study, we analyzed the yield and polarization of\(J/\psi \)in relativistic heavy ion collisions at different centrality and transverse momentum regions, using three different reference frames: the Collins–Soper frame, the helicity frame, and the event plane frame. The polarization of initially produced\(J/\psi \)is determined by the NRQCD calculation and is similar to that ofppcollisions. However, both unpolarization and transverse polarization are considered for the regenerated\(J/\psi \). Our results indicate that the polarization at high\(p_T\)is similar to that observed inppcollisions. However, at low\(p_T\), where regenerated\(J/\psi \)dominates, it is likely that the polarized charm quarks in the rotational QGP medium are responsible for this phenomenon. Our study supplies a baseline for future research on the effects of strong electromagnetic and vorticity fields on\(J/\psi \)polarization.
This paper investigates the disparity between matter and antimatter in the universe with the help of gravitational baryogenesis. This phenomenon commenced shortly after the big bang, resulting in a predominance of matter over antimatter. We analyze the mechanism of gravitational baryogenesis (baryon to entropy ratio) under the framework off(Q,C) gravity, whereQindicates non-metricity scalar andCdenotes the boundary term. This Phenomenon depends on the charge parity violation interaction and for this paper we produce it with the coupling between baryon matter current (\(j^{\nu }\)) and\(\partial _{\nu }(Q+C)\). In the present work, we evaluate he baryon to entropy ratio (\(\frac{\eta _{_B}}{S}\)) by proposing two models off(Q,C) with the assumption of power-law scale factor for each model and the universe contains perfect fluid throughout. We find that under optimal choice of model parameters, the results of\(\frac{\eta _{_B}}{S}\)of propose models inf(Q,C) are compatible with the observational bound. The crux of the current work is that the outcomes of our propose models for generalized case of gravitational baryogenesis are consist with its observational constraint in different eras of the Universe.
We propose a technique to generate a new class of solutions for an anisotropic charged matter distribution. We show its viability as a model to describe an ultra-compact static spherically symmetric star where anisotropy may be a dominant factor. The solution extends some previously reported stellar solutions with or without charge or anisotropy. The interior matter distribution satisfies a double equation of state with two parameters. The parameters affect the gravitational behaviour of the model and the physical features, such as stability.
The null-surface formulation (NSF) of general relativity differs markedly from the conventional approach. The conventional approach to general relativity is concerned with local fields such as the metric, whereas the NSF focuses on surfaces. The NSF has two distinct but mathematically equivalent interpretations: (a) Future-directed light rays leave a spacetime point and intersect future null-infinity. The resulting surface, known as a light-cone cut, encodes the properties of the spacetime; (b) The angular coordinates (Bondi coordinates) of null-infinity are used to label past light cones, thereby producing a family of null surfaces. These will satisfy the NSF field equations and a solution of these equations provides a description of spacetime. This paper features a new exact solution that, for the first time, directly links the two interpretations, thereby illustrating both approaches and demonstrating their equivalence. The solution and its properties are first explored in 2+1 dimensions, after which, the generalization to 3+1 is outlined.
The static properties and dynamic evolution of bottomonium states in a hot QCD medium are investigated through the Schrödinger equation with complex heavy quark potentials, which have been presented recently in a lattice QCD study and with three different extractions. This approach builds a direct connection between the in-medium heavy quark potentials from the lattice QCD to the experimental observables. The yields and nuclear modification factors\(R_{AA}\)of bottomonium in Pb–Pb collisions at\(\sqrt{s_\textrm{NN}}=5.02\)TeV are calculated in this work. Our results show a large suppression of the bottomonium yield in heavy ion collisions due to the large imaginary potential. To understand bottomonium\(R_{AA}\)based on lattice QCD potentials, we propose a formation time for bottomonium states and find that experimental data can be well explained with the heavy quark potential extracted by the Padé fit, which shows no color screening in the real part potential.
The acceleration observed in cosmological expansion is often attributed to negative pressure, potentially arising from quintessence. We explore the relationship between the photon orbit radius and the phase transition of spherical AdS black holes inf(R,T) gravity influenced by quintessence dark energy, specifically Kiselev-AdS black holes inf(R,T) gravity. We are treating the negative cosmological constant\(\Lambda \)as the system’s pressure to examine the impact of the state parameter\(\omega \)and thef(R,T) gravity parameter\(\gamma \). Interestingly, Kiselev-AdS black holes within thef(R,T) gravity framework exhibit a van der Waals-like phase transition. In contrast, these black holes display a Hawking–Page-like phase transition in general relativity. We demonstrate that below the critical point, the black hole undergoes a first-order vdW-like phase transition, with\(r_{ps}\)and\(u_{ps}\)serving as order parameters exhibiting a critical exponent of 1/2, similar to ordinary thermal systems. It suggests that\(r_{ps}\)and\(u_{ps}\)can serve as order parameters in characterizing black hole phase transitions, hinting at a potentially universal gravitational relationship near critical points within black hole thermodynamic systems. Investigating the correlation between photon sphere radius and thermodynamic phase transitions provides a valuable means of distinguishing between different gravity theory models, ultimately shedding light on the nature of dark energy. Finally, as\(\gamma \)tends towards zero, our results precisely align with those of Kiselev-AdS black holes.
We study systematically magnetic moments of hiddden-bottom pentaquark states with quantum numbers\(J^P=\frac{1}{2}^{\pm }\),\(J^P=\frac{3}{2}^{\pm }\), and\(J^P=\frac{5}{2}^{\pm }\)with molecular, diquark–diquark–antiquark, and diquark–triquark models. The numerical results show that magnetic moments are different within the same model according to same quantum numbers and spin-orbit couplings. The results are also different when different models are taken into account with the same angular momentum. The magnetic moments encode valuable information about inner structures. We believe that our results may be helpful for experimental studies.
Time-delay measurements from strong lensing systems combined with spectroscopic measurements of stellar kinematics in deflecting galaxies provide a natural way to infer absolute distances (lensing distances). This means that it can be used to anchor the relative distances of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and further infer the Hubble constant\(H_0\)in a cosmological model-independent way, while avoiding the assumptions of curvature and the equation of state of dark energy. Indeed, observations based on gravitational lensing time delays can measure\(H_0\)directly, but usually require assumptions about the specific cosmological models. Meanwhile, this method suffers the mass-sheet degeneracy obstacle. These factors may induce the bias on determination of\(H_0\). However, the inverse distance ladder method we use avoids these assumptions altogether. In this study, we seek for the Pantheon and Pantheon plus datasets and use Gaussian process regression to reconstruct the unanchored distance to match the distance at the redshift of the lens to determine\(H_0\), respectively. Based on the four H0LiCOW lenses, the unanchored distances reconstructed by combining the Pantheon and Pantheon plus datasets yielded\(H_0=80.1^{+7.0}_{-6.9} \mathrm {~km/s/Mpc}\)and\(H_0=81.2^{+7.1}_{-7.0} \mathrm {~km/s/Mpc}\)with\(1 \sigma \)observational uncertainty, respectively. All the lenses show the measured\(H_0\)is in good agreement with the local measurement results reported by the SH0ES collaboration within\(\sim \)\(1.3 \sigma \)confidence level.
Understanding the behavior of fermion-antifermion (\(f\overline{f}\)) pairs is crucial in modern physics. These systems, governed by fundamental forces, exhibit complex interactions essential for particle physics, high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and solid-state physics. This study introduces a novel theoretical model using the many-body Dirac equation for\(f\overline{f}\)pairs with an effective position-dependent mass (i.e.,\(m \rightarrow m + \mathcal {S}(r)\)) under the influence of an external magnetic field. To validate our model, we show that by modifying the mass with a Coulomb-like potential,\(m(r) = m - \alpha /r\), where\(-\alpha /r\)is the Lorentz scalar potential\(\mathcal {S}(r)\), our results match the well-established energy eigenvalues for\(f\overline{f}\)pairs interacting through the Coulomb potential, without approximation. By applying adjustments based on the Cornell potential (i.e.,\(\mathcal {S}(r) = kr - \alpha /r\)), we derive a closed-form energy expression. We believe this unique model offers significant insights into the dynamics of\(f\overline{f}\)pairs under various interaction potentials, with potential applications in particle physics. Additionally, it could be extended to various\(f\overline{f}\)systems, such as positronium, relativistic Landau levels for neutral mesons, excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, and Weyl pairs in monolayer graphene sheets.

We believe this unique model offers significant insights into the dynamics of\(f\overline{f}\)pairs under various interaction potentials, with potential applications in particle physics. Additionally, it could be extended to various\(f\overline{f}\)systems, such as positronium, relativistic Landau levels for neutral mesons, excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, and Weyl pairs in monolayer graphene sheets.
In this paper, we investigate the quasi-two-body decays\(B_c \rightarrow K_0^{*}(1430,1950) D_{(s)} \rightarrow K \pi D_{(s)}\)within the perturbative QCD (PQCD) framework. The S-wave two-meson distribution amplitudes (DAs) are introduced to describe the final state interactions of the\(K\pi \)pair, which involve the time-like form factors and the Gegenbauer polynomials. In the calculations, we adopt two kinds of parameterization schemes to describe the time-like form factors: one is the relativistic Breit–Wigner (RBW) formula, which is usually more suitable for the narrow resonances, and the other is the LASS line shape proposed by the LASS Collaboration, which includes both the resonant and nonresonant components. We find that the branching ratios and the direct CP violations for the decays\(B_c \rightarrow K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)}\)obtained from those of the quasi-two-body decays\(B_c \rightarrow K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)} \rightarrow K \pi D_{(s)}\)under the narrow width approximation (NWA) can be consistent well with the previous PQCD results calculated in the two-body framework by assuming that\(K^*_0(1430)\)is the lowest lying\(\bar{q} s\)state, which is the so-called scenario II (SII). We conclude that the LASS parameterization is more suitable to describe the\(K_0^{*}(1430)\)than the RBW formula, and the nonresonant components play an important role in the branching ratios of the decays\(B_c \rightarrow K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)} \rightarrow K \pi D_{(s)}\). In view of the large difference between the decay width measurements for the\(K_0^{*}(1950)\)given by BaBar and LASS collaborations, we calculate the branching ratios and the CP violations for the quasi-two-body decays\(B_c \rightarrow K_0^{*}(1950) D_{(s)} \rightarrow K \pi D_{(s)}\)by using two values,\(\Gamma _{K^*_0(1950)}=0.100\pm 0.04\)GeV and\(\Gamma _{K^*_0(1950)}=0.201\pm 0.034\)GeV, besides the two kinds of parameterizations for the resonance\(K^*_0(1950)\). We find that the branching ratios and the direct CP violations for the decays\(B_c \rightarrow K_0^{*}(1950) D_{(s)} \rightarrow K \pi D_{(s)}\)have not as large difference between the two parameterizations as the case of decays involving the\(K^*_0(1430)\), especially for the results with\(\Gamma _{K^*_0(1950)}=0.201\pm 0.034\)GeV. The effect of the nonresonant component in the\(K^*_0(1950)\)may be not so serious as that in the\(K^*_0(1430)\). The quasi-two-body decays\(B^+_c \rightarrow K^{*+}_0(1430) D^{0} \rightarrow K^0 \pi ^+ D^{0}\)and\(B^+_c \rightarrow K^{*0}_0(1430) D^{+} \rightarrow K^+ \pi ^- D^{+}\)have large branching ratios, which can reach to the order of\(10^{-4}\)and are most likely to be observed in the future LHCb experiments. Furthermore, the branching ratios of the quasi-two-body decays\(B_c \rightarrow K_0^{*}(1950) D_{(s)} \rightarrow K \pi D_{(s)}\)are about one order smaller than those of the corresponding decays\(B_c \rightarrow K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)} \rightarrow K \pi D_{(s)}\).
In this paper, we revisit the model-independent reconstruction off(T) andf(R) gravity at the cosmological background and linear matter density perturbation levels respectively via Gaussian process by using the currently available cosmic observations, which consist Pantheon+ SNe Ia samples, observed Hubble parameterH(z) and the redshift space distortion\(f\sigma _8(z)\)data points. For thef(T) gravity, we find the reconstructed form off(T) from the background and perturbation levels cannot match each other well in 1\(\sigma \)regions, it might imply the tension between the background and perturbation evolutions. For thef(R) gravity, due to the existence of an extra degree for freedom\({\dot{F}}\), the form off(R) can be reconstructed by the addition of the growth rate function. The results show that the reconstructed form off(R) might be viable in the redshift range of\(z<0.75\)based on the currently available cosmic observations, for filling the requirement of\(f_{,R}>0\)and\(f_{,RR}>0\)to avoid a tachyonic instability and be ghosts free in theory.
The energy dependence for the singlet sector of Parton Distributions Functions (PDFs) is described by an entangled pair of ordinary linear differential equations. Although there are no exact analytic solutions, it is possible to provide approximated results depending on the assumptions and the methodology adopted. These results differ in their sub-leading, neglected terms and ultimately they are associated with different treatments of the theoretical uncertainties. In this work, a novel analytic approach in Mellin space is presented and a new methodology for obtaining closed and exponentiated analytic solutions is devised. Different results for the DGLAP evolution at Next-Leading-Order are compared, discussing advantages and disadvantages for each solution. The generalizations to higher orders are addressed.
Realistic quantum systems are affected by the expanding universe in their preparation and quantum information processing. In this paper, we study the relationship between the Gaussian quantum steering distribution and the parameters of the expanding universe. The expansion process of the universe can be described as a channel acting on a two-mode squeezed Gaussian state, with the evolution of quantum steering from the asymptotic past to the asymptotic future resulting in new distributions parameterized by cosmic parameters. We find that Gaussian quantum steering is more sensitive to the volume change of the expanding universe than the expansion rate, and the Gaussian quantum steering generated by particles with suitable mass and small momentum is more affected by the expanding universe.
In 2022, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration has reported the first observations of Sagittarius A*(SgrA*). Applying the EHT observational results, we find out constraints on non-singular Hayward parameter of regular dark energy black hole. Considering these constraints and different thin disk accretion, we present a detailed investigation into influence of different dark energy and Hayward parameters on shadows from non-singular Hayward black holes. In the first second-order attenuation function model, corresponding shadow radius and peak for observed intensity from direct image decrease with increasing dark energy parameter and Hayward parameter. However, for the lensing ring and photon ring, corresponding peak become bigger as dark energy parameter increase in case of fixed Hayward parameter. In the second third-order attenuation function model, significantly different from model 1, above two rings completely overlay on the direct image, resulting in two distinct peaks in the observed intensity. As increase of Hayward and dark energy parameters, the difference between the two peaks decreases, and shadows and observed intensity decrease. In the final inverse trigonometric function attenuation model, the result shows corresponding lensing ring as well as photon ring can be distinguished within the superposition region, and the superposition region becomes larger. With the increase of the dark energy parameter, the shadow radius exhibits a decreasing trend, while observed intensity increases. However, with the increase of the Hayward parameter, both decreases. Compared with the first two models, the shadow radius becomes smaller, but the observed intensity becomes larger, making the bright ring wider and brighter. Therefore, different accretion models and non-singular Hayward parameters can give rise to interesting and distinguish characteristic for the black hole shadow and rings.
We consider Klein–Gordon equation in the Dyonic Kerr–Sen black hole background, which is the charged rotating axially symmetric solution of the Einstein–Maxwell–Dilaton–Axion theory of gravity. The black hole incorporates electric, magnetic, dilatonic and axionic charges and is constructed in 3+1 dimensional spacetime. We begin our investigations with the construction of the scalar field’s governing equation, i.e., the covariant Klein–Gordon equation. With the help of the ansatz of separation of variables, we successfully separate the polar part, and find the exact solution in terms of Spheroidal Harmonics, while the radial exact solution is obtained in terms of the Confluent Heun function. The quantization of the quasibound state is done by applying the polynomial condition of the Confluent Heun function that gives rise to discrete complex-valued energy levels for massive scalar fields. The real part is the scalar field relativistic quantized energy, while the imaginary part represents the quasibound states’s decay. We present all of the sixteen possible exact energy solutions for both massive and massless scalars. We also present the investigation the Hawking radiation of the Dyonic Kerr–Sen black hole’s apparent horizon, via the Sigurd–Sannan method by making use of the obtained exact scalar wave functions. The radiation distribution function, and the Hawking temperature are also obtained.
The CP-violating phase\(\phi _s\), the\(B_{s}\)decay width (\(\varGamma _s\)), and the\(B_{s}\)decay width difference (\(\varDelta \varGamma _s\)) are sensitive probes to new physics and can constrain the heavy quark expansion theory. The potential for the measurement at futureZfactories is studied in this manuscript. It is found that operating at Tera-Zmode, the expected precision can reach:\(\sigma (\phi _s) = 4.6~\textrm{mrad}\),\(\sigma (\varDelta \varGamma _s) = 2.4~\mathrm {ns^{-1}}\)and\(\sigma (\varGamma _s) = 0.72~\mathrm {ns^{-1}}\). The precision of\(\phi _s \)is 40% larger than the expected precision with the LHCb experiment at HL-LHC. If operating at 10-Tera-Zmode, the precision of\(\phi _s \)can be measured at 45% of the precision obtained from the LHCb experiment at HL-LHC. However, the measurement of\(\varGamma _s\)and\(\varDelta \varGamma _s\)cannot benefit from the excellent time resolution and tagging power of the futureZ-factories. Only operating at 10-Tera-Zmode can the\(\varGamma _s\)and\(\varDelta \varGamma _s\)reach an 18% larger precision than the precision expected to be obtained from LHCb at HL-LHC. The control of penguin contamination at the future Z-factories is also discussed.
We study the universal behavior associated with a Relativistic Boltzmann Transport (RBT) approach with the full collision integral in 0+1D conformal systems. We show that all momentum moments of the distribution function exhibit universal behavior. Furthermore, the RBT approach allows to calculate the full distribution function, showing that an attractor behavior is present in both the longitudinal and transverse momentum dependence. We compare our results to the far-from-equilibrium attractors determined with other approaches, such as kinetic theory in Relaxation Time Approximation (RTA) and relativistic hydrodynamic theories, both in their viscous (DNMR) an anisotropic (aHydro) formulations, finding a very similar evolution, but an even faster thermalization in RBT for higher order moments. For the first time, we extended this analysis also to study the attractor behavior under a temperature-dependent viscosity\(\eta /s(T)\), accounting also for the rapid increase toward the hadronic phase. We find that a partial breaking of the scaling behavior with respect to\(\tau /\tau _{eq}\)emerges only at\(T \approx T_c\)generating a transient deviation from attractors; interestingly this in realistic finite systems may occur around the freeze-out dynamics. Finally, we investigate for the first time results beyond the boost-invariant picture, finding that also in such a case the system evolves toward the universal attractor. In particular, we present the forward and pull-back attractors at different space-time rapidities including rapidity regions where initially the distribution function is even vanishing.
We present a method for the numerical computation of Fourier–Bessel transforms on a finite or infinite interval. The function to be transformed needs to be evaluated on a grid of points that is independent of the argument of the Bessel function. We demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithm for a wide range of functions, including those that appear in the context of transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions in Quantum Chromodynamics.
In this paper we develop a method to obtain the rates for the decay of a Z boson into fermions in de Sitter geometry. Our general results obtained in de Sitter space-time allow us to obtain the Minkowski limits for the transition rates when the expansion parameter vanishes. Another important result reported in the present study is related to the emission of Z bosons by electrons and positrons. All the processes were studied by implementing perturbative methods that allow us to define the transition amplitudes in the first order of perturbation theory. The variation of probabilities and rates in terms of expansion parameter and particles masses is also given, pointing out that the processes that generate particle production are possible only in the early universe. For computing the transition rates and probabilities we use the dimensional regularization method and the minimal substraction method.
Research infrastructures have been identified as an important source of greenhouse gas emissions of astronomical research. Based on a comprehensive inventory of 1,211 ground-based observatories and space missions, we assessed the evolution of the number of astronomical facilities and their carbon footprint from 1945 to 2022. We found that space missions dominate greenhouse gas emissions in astronomy, showing an important peak at the end of the 1960s, followed by a decrease that has turned again into a rise over the last decade. Extrapolating past trends, we predict that greenhouse gas emissions from astronomical facilities will experience no strong decline in the future, and may even rise substantially, unless research practices are changed. We demonstrate that a continuing growth in the number of operating astronomical facilities is not environmentally sustainable. These findings should motivate the astronomical community to reflect about the necessary evolutions that would put astronomical research on a sustainable path.
We investigate the possibility of multi-lepton (four and six) signatures, including an exotic signature of same-sign four-lepton (SS4L) as signals of pair production of a doubly charged Higgs in the minimal left-right symmetric model, extended with two doublet scalars. The right-handed neutrino masses are generated in this model through a dimension-5 lepton-number violating operator allowing the triplet scalar interactions with leptons to become negligibly small. This leads to interesting six-lepton and SS4L signatures that can be observed at the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) with almost no background for doubly charged Higgs with mass below 500 GeV.
The one-dimensional quantum breakdown model, which features spatially asymmetric fermionic interactions simulating the electrical breakdown phenomenon, exhibits an exponential U(1) symmetry and a variety of dynamical phases including many-body localization and quantum chaos with quantum scar states. We investigate the minimal quantum breakdown model with the minimal number of on-site fermion orbitals required for the interaction and identify a large number of local conserved charges in the model. We then reveal a mapping between the minimal quantum breakdown model in certain charge sectors and a quantum link model which simulates theU(1) lattice gauge theory and show that the local conserved charges map to the gauge symmetry generators. A special charge sector of the model further maps to the PXP model, which shows quantum many-body scars. This mapping unveils the rich dynamics in different Krylov subspaces characterized by different gauge configurations in the quantum breakdown model.
We introduce a two-step procedure for finding Kerr-type rotating black hole solutions without tears. Considering the low-energy sector of Hořava gravity as aviableLorentz-violating gravity in four dimensions which admits a different speed of gravity, we find the exact rotating black hole solutions (with or without cosmological constant). We find that the singular region extends to\(r<0\)region from the ring singularity at\(r=0\)in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates. There are two Killing horizons where\(g^{rr}=0\)and the black hole thermodynamics laws are still valid. We find the rotating black hole solutions with electromagnetic charges only when we consider thenobleelectromagnetic couplings, in such a way that the speed of light is the same as the speed of gravity. With the noble choice of couplings, our Lorentz-violating gravity can be consistent with the recently-observed time delay of the coincident GW and GRB signals. Furthermore, in Appendices, we show that (a) the uniqueness of the invariant line element\(ds^2\)underthe foliation-preservingdiffeomorphism\({ Diff}_\mathcal{F}\), contrary to Lorentz-violating action, (b) the solutions are the Petrov type I with four distinct principal null vectors, and (c) the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesic particles arenotseparable.
The current upper limit on\(N_\textrm{eff}\)at the time of CMB by Planck 2018 can place stringent constraints in the parameter space of BSM paradigms where their additional interactions may affect neutrino decoupling. Motivated by this fact in this paper we explore the consequences of light gauge boson (\(Z'\)) emerging from local\(U(1)_X\)symmetry in\(N_\textrm{eff}\)at the time of CMB. First, we analyze the generic\(U(1)_X\)models with arbitrary charge assignments for the SM fermions and show that, in the context of\(N_\textrm{eff}\)the generic\(U(1)_X\)gauged models can be broadly classified into two categories, depending on the charge assignments of first generation leptons. We then perform a detailed analysis with two specific\(U(1)_X\)models:\(U(1)_{B_3-3L_e}\)and\(U(1)_{B_3-3L_\mu }\)and explore the contribution in\(N_\textrm{eff}\)due to the presence of\(Z'\)realized in those models. For comparison, we also showcase the constraints from low energy experiments like: Borexino, Xenon 1T, neutrino trident, etc. We show that in a specific parameter space, particularly in the low mass region of\(Z'\), the bound from\(N_\textrm{eff}\)(Planck 2018) is more stringent than the experimental constraints. Additionally, a part of the regions of the same parameter space may also relax the\(H_0\)tension.
The massless fields in the universal NS-NS sector of string theory formO(D,D) multiplets of Double Field Theory, which is a theory that provides a T-duality covariant formulation of supergravity, leading to a stringy modification of General Relativity. In this framework, it is possible to write down the extensions of the Einstein field equations and the Friedmann equations in such a way that the coupling of gravitational and matter sectors is dictated by theO(D,D) symmetry universally. In this paper, we obtain the autonomous form of theO(D,D)-complete Friedmann equations, find the critical points and perform their stability analysis. We also include the phase portraits of the system. Cosmologically interesting cases of scalar field, radiation, and matter are separately considered and compared with the Chameleon models in a similar setting. Accelerating phases and the conditions for their existence are also given for such cases.
In this paper, we investigate symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) in free bosonic quantum many-body systems. Utilizing a lattice regularization scheme, we compute symmetry-resolved Rényi entropies for free complex scalar fields and a specific class of non-local field theories, where entanglement entropy (EE) exhibits volume-law scaling. We present effective and approximate eigenvalues for the correlation matrix used in computing SREE and demonstrate their consistency with numerical results. Furthermore, we explore the equipartition of EE, verifying its effective behavior in the massless limit. Finally, we comment on EE in non-local quantum field theories and provide an explicit expression for the symmetry-resolved Rényi entropies.
A conformal invariant QED-inspired model is solved for a general covariant linear gauge using the Dyson–Schwinger equations for the propagators assuming a pure vector like interaction. The leading corrections to the asymptotic solutions and the exponents, that characterize the corrections to each of the two fermion propagator functions, are computed as a function of the coupling and gauge fixing parameter\(\xi \). For the scalar component of the fermion propagator our findings generalizes for linear covariant gauges previous results found in the literature and reproduce the outcome of the perturbative analysis of quenched QED in the Landau gauge. Our solution for the exponent associated with vector component of the fermion propagator is new and, in the weak coupling regime, agrees with the estimation based on the perturbative analysis of quenched QED. Of the two critical exponents describing the conformal limit of the vector interaction, one of them is, in QED, associated with the regime where chiral symmetry is broken dynamically, which demands one mass scale, namely the Miransky scaling. A second mass scale has to be introduced at larger coupling constants and is associated with a change on the nature of the fermion wave function. This provides one example, that it is possible to find two interwoven cycles in Quantum Field Theory, albeit in a truncated framework, as it is known in the quantum few-body problem in the limit of a zero-range interaction.
The Yang algebra was proposed a long time ago as a generalization of the Snyder algebra to the case of curved background spacetime. It includes as subalgebras both the Snyder and the de Sitter algebras and can therefore be viewed as a model of noncommutative curved spacetime. A peculiarity with respect to standard models of noncommutative geometry is that it includes translation and Lorentz generators, so that the definition of a Hopf algebra and the physical interpretation of the variables conjugated to the primary ones is not trivial. In this paper we consider the realizations of the Yang algebra and its\(\kappa \)-deformed generalization on an extended phase space and in this way we are able to define a Hopf structure and a twist.
We study the decay of Dirac and massive scalar fields at asymptotically late times in the background of the charged asymptotically de Sitter dilatonic black holes. It is shown that the asymptotic decay is exponential and oscillatory for large and intermediate mass of the field, while for zero and small mass it is pure exponential without oscillations. This reflects the dominance of quasinormal modes of the empty de Sitter spacetime at asymptotically late times. We also show that the earlier WKB calculation of the massive scalar field spectrum does not allow one to find the fundamental mode with reasonable accuracy.
In this work, tilted source solutions in both Einstein–Hilbert General Relativity (GR) and Quadratic Gravity (QG) for the anisotropic Bianchi V model are addressed. Since the excellent CMBR match of Starobinsky’s inflation with Planck’s team measurements data, QG has acquired a prominent status in the effective sense, for sufficiently strong gravity fields. The main interest is in the numeric time evolution to thepasttowards the singularity and the behavior of the kinematic variables, vorticity, acceleration, and the expansion of this source substance. In QG we found that for universes with higher and smaller matter densities fall into the Kasner or isotropic singularity attractors to the past, respectively. We also found that the Kasner singularity attractor to the past has always zero vorticity, for both GR and QG theories. While for QG the isotropic singularity attractor may have divergent vorticity. For the set of assumptions and conditions supposed in this work, the isotropic singularity attractor, favors QG as compared to GR. Only in QG we were able to find a geometric singularity with divergences in all of the kinematic variables of the substance, decreasing to finite values to thefuture, upon time reversing. That is, we obtained an initial kinematic singularity substance, that approaches a perfect fluid source.
A gravitational field can cause a rotation of the polarisation vector of light. This phenomenon is known as the gravitational Faraday effect. We study the gravitational Faraday effect of linearly polarised light propagating in the gravitational field of a weak plane gravitational wave (GW) with “\(+\)", “\(\times \)", and elliptical polarisation modes. The corresponding gravitational Faraday rotation angle is proportional to the GW amplitude and to the squared distance traveled by the light and inversely proportional to the GW squared wavelength. The Faraday rotation is maximal if the light propagates along directions perpendicular to the GW propagation and tilted by\(\pi /4\)to the directions of its polarisation. There is no a gravitational Faraday rotation when light and a GW propagate along the same directions, or when light propagates along directions of a GW polarisation. Helicity of an elliptically polarised GW gives cubic order contribution to the Faraday rotation.
\(U(N)^{\otimes r} \otimes O(N)^{\otimes q}\)invariants are constructed by contractions of complex tensors of order\(r+q\), also denoted (r,q). These tensors transform underrfundamental representations of the unitary groupU(N) andqfundamental representations of the orthogonal groupO(N). Therefore,\(U(N)^{\otimes r} \otimes O(N)^{\otimes q}\)invariants are tensor model observables endowed with a tensor field of order (r,q). We enumerate these observables using group theoretic formulae, for tensor fields of arbitrary order (r,q). Inspecting lower-order cases reveals that, at order (1, 1), the number of invariants corresponds to a number of 2- or 4-ary necklaces that exhibit pattern avoidance, offering insights into enumerative combinatorics. For a general order (r,q), the counting can be interpreted as the partition function of a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) with the symmetric group serving as gauge group. We identify the 2-complex pertaining to the enumeration of the invariants, which in turn defines the TQFT, and establish a correspondence with countings associated with covers of diverse topologies. For\(r>1\), the number of invariants matches the number of (q-dependent) weighted equivalence classes of branched covers of the 2-sphere withrbranched points. At\(r=1\), the counting maps to the enumeration of branched covers of the 2-sphere with\(q+3\)branched points. The formalism unveils a wide array of novel integer sequences that have not been previously documented. We also provide various codes for running computational experiments.
The statefinder diagnostic is useful to discriminate dark energy models. In this paper, under the minimum assumption of a spatially flat Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker Universe, we reconstruct the statefinder pair\(\{r(z),s(z)\}\)in addition to the deceleration parameterq(z) via the Gaussian process from the cosmic observational data points which include the recently released Pantheon+ SN Ia samples and the observational Hubble dataH(z). The reconstructed evolution trajectories are shown on the\(r-q\),\(r-s\)planes. The reconstructedq(z) is consistent with previous studies. Meanwhile, a novel quantity namedsuitabilityis introduced on the\(r-q\),\(r-s\)planes to assess the validation of a dark energy model.
The standardΛCDM cosmological model predicts the presence of cold dark matter, with the current accelerated expansion of the Universe driven by dark energy. This model has recently come under scrutiny because of tensions in measurements of the expansion and growth histories of the Universe, parameterized usingH0andS8. The three-dimensional clustering of galaxies encodes key cosmological information that addresses these tensions. Here we present a set of cosmological constraints using simulation-based inference that exploits additional non-Gaussian information on nonlinear scales from galaxy clustering, inaccessible with current analyses. We analyse a subset of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) galaxy survey usingSimBIG, a new framework for cosmological inference that leverages high-fidelity simulations and deep generative models. We use two clustering statistics beyond the standard power spectrum: the bispectrum and a summary of the galaxy field based on a convolutional neural network. We constrainH0andS81.5 and 1.9 times more tightly than power spectrum analyses. With this increased precision, our constraints are competitive with those of other cosmological probes, even with only 10% of the full BOSS volume. Future work extendingSimBIGto upcoming spectroscopic galaxy surveys (DESI, PFS, Euclid) will produce improved cosmological constraints that will develop understanding of cosmic tensions.
We examine the geometrical differences between the black hole (BH) and naked singularity (NS) or superspinar via Lense–Thirring (LT) precession in spinning modified-gravity (MOG). ForBHcase, we show that the LT precession frequency (\(\Omega _{LT}\)) along the pole is proportional to the angular-momentum (J) parameter or spin parameter (a) and is inversely proportional to the cubic value of radial distance parameter, and also governed by Eq. (1). Along the equatorial plane it is governed by Eq. (2). While forsuperspinar, we show that the LT precession frequency is inversely proportional to the cubic value of the spin parameter and it decreases with distance by MOG parameter as derived in Eq. (3) at the pole and in the limit\(a>>r\)(whereais spin parameter). For\(\theta \ne \frac{\pi }{2}\)and in the superspinar limit, the spin frequency varies as\(\Omega _{LT}\propto \frac{1}{a^3\cos ^4\theta }\)and by Eq. (38).
Recent data from elliptical galaxies indicate that the growth in the masses of black holes exceeds what is expected from the accretion of surrounding matter, and this growth appears to be dependent on the expansion of the universe. This phenomenon can be explained by considering the accretion of dark energy, which is responsible for cosmological expansion, into these black holes. In this paper, we investigate the perturbative interaction of a black hole with a real scalar field\(\phi \)(which can represent dark energy) in a cosmological background using an appropriate metric. We derive solutions for the field\(\phi (t, r)\), the black hole massM(t), and the expansion rateH(t), and discuss the behaviour of the scalar field\(\phi \)in the vicinity of the black hole, with respect to exterior and interior observers.
In this paper we study meson scattering in a non-minimally Lorentz-violating scalar QED at finite temperature. The meson scatterings were investigated in tree level and the finite temperature effects were addressed by using the thermofield dynamics formalism. We have considered three types of scattering, namely, meson-antimeson ofa-type into meson-antimeson ofb-type, meson-antimeson ofa-type into meson-antimeson ofa-type and meson-meson ofa-type into meson-meson ofa-type. For each scattering we have computed the cross section in order to investigate the influence of the finite temperature effects.
A measurement is presented of a ratio observable that provides a measure of the azimuthal correlations among jets with large transverse momentum\(p_{\textrm{T}}\). This observable is measured in multijet events over the range of\(p_{\textrm{T}} = 360\)–\(3170\,\text {Ge}\hspace{-.08em}\text {V} \)based on data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\(\,\text {Te}\hspace{-.08em}\text {V}\), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 134\(\,\text {fb}^{-1}\). The results are compared with predictions from Monte Carlo parton-shower event generator simulations, as well as with fixed-order perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) predictions at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy obtained with different parton distribution functions (PDFs) and corrected for nonperturbative and electroweak effects. Data and theory agree within uncertainties. From the comparison of the measured observable with the pQCD prediction obtained with the NNPDF3.1 NLO PDFs, the strong coupling at the Z boson mass scale is\(\alpha _\textrm{S} (m_{{\textrm{Z}}}) =0.1177 \pm 0.0013\, \text {(exp)} _{-0.0073}^{+0.0116} \,\text {(theo)} = 0.1177_{-0.0074}^{+0.0117}\), where the total uncertainty is dominated by the scale dependence of the fixed-order predictions. A test of the running of\(\alpha _\textrm{S}\)in the\(\,\text {Te}\hspace{-.08em}\text {V}\)region shows no deviation from the expected NLO pQCD behaviour.
In this article, we explore the Yukawa modification of the Casimir wormhole within the framework off(R) gravity. To accomplish this, we adopt an approach proposed by Garattini (Eur Phys J C 81:824, 2021), wherein the original Casimir source is modified by a Yukawa term in three distinct scenarios. We utilize these Yukawa Casimir energy densities to assess the feasibility of traversable wormholes. The resulting shape function satisfies the criteria for traversability under the specified parameter values. Furthermore, we scrutinize the energy conditions and the violation of the null energy conditions suggests the presence of exotic matter within the Yukawa Casimir wormholes. Additionally, we analyze the embedding procedures for the wormhole geometry.
We present a novel implementation of the Schwinger mechanism in QCD, which fixes uniquely the scale of the effective gluon mass scale and streamlines considerably the procedure of multiplicative renormalization. The key advantage of this method stems from the nonlinear nature of the dynamical equation that generates massless poles in the longitudinal sector of the three-gluon vertex. An exceptional feature of this approach is an extensive cancellation involving the components of the integral expression that determines the gluon mass scale; it is triggered once the Schwinger–Dyson equation of the pole-free part of the three-gluon vertex has been appropriately exploited. It turns out that this cancellation is driven by the so-called Fredholm alternatives theorem, which operates among the set of integral equations describing this system. Quite remarkably, in the linearized approximation this theorem enforces the exact masslessness of the gluon. Instead, the nonlinearity induced by the full treatment of the relevant kernel evades this theorem, allowing for the emergence of a nonvanishing mass scale. The numerical results obtained from the resulting equations are compatible with the lattice findings, and may be further refined through the inclusion of the remaining fundamental vertices of the theory.
TRAPPIST-1 hosts seven planets. The period ratios of neighbouring pairs are close to the 8:5, 5:3, 3:2, 3:2, 4:3 and 3:2 ratios in increasing distance from the star. The Laplace angles associated with neighbouring triplets are observed to be librating, proving the resonant nature of the system. This compact, resonant configuration is a manifest sign of disk-driven migration; however, the preferred outcome of such evolution is the establishment of first-order resonances, not the high-order resonances observed in the inner system. Here, we explain the observed orbital configuration with a model that is largely independent of the specific disk migration and orbital circularization efficiencies. Together with migration, the two key elements of our model are that the inner border of the protoplanetary disk receded with time and that the system was initially separated into two subsystems. Specifically, the inner b, c, d and e planets were initially placed in a 3:2 resonance chain and then evolved to the 8:5–5:3 commensurability between planets b, c and d due to the recession of the inner edge of the disk, whereas the outer planets migrated to the inner edge at a later time and established the remaining resonances. Our results pivot on the dynamical role of the presently unobservable recession of the inner edge of protoplanetary disks. They also reveal the role of recurring phases of convergent migration followed by resonant repulsion with associated orbital circularization when resonant chains interact with migration barriers.
Water is an important component of exoplanets, with its distribution, that is, whether at the surface or deep inside, fundamentally influencing the planetary properties. The distribution of water in most exoplanets is determined by yet-unknown partition coefficients at extreme conditions. Here we first conduct ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the metal–silicate partition coefficients of water up to 1,000 GPa and then model planet interiors by considering the effects of water content on density, melting temperature and water partitioning. Our calculations reveal that water strongly partitions into iron over silicate at high pressures and, thus, would preferentially stay in a planet’s core. The results of our planet interior model challenge the notion of water worlds as imagined before: the majority of the bulk water budget (even more than 95%) can be stored deep within the core and the mantle, and not at the surface. For planets more massive than ~6 M⨁and Earth-size planets (of lower mass and small water budgets), the majority of water resides deep in the cores of planets. Whether water is assumed to be at the surface or at depth can affect the radius up to 15–25% for a given mass. The exoplanets previously believed to be water-poor on the basis of mass–radius data may actually be rich in water.
The Sen formulation for chiral (2p)-form in\(4p+2\)dimensions describes a system with two separate sectors, one is physical while the other is unphysical. Each contains a chiral form and a metric. In this paper, we focus on the cases where the self-duality condition for the unphysical sector is linear while for the physical sector can be nonlinear. We show the decoupling at the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian levels. The decoupling at the Hamiltonian level follows the idea in the literature. Then by an appropriate field redefinition of the corresponding first-order Lagrangian, the separation at the Lagrangian level follows. We derive the diffeomorphism of the theory in the case where the chiral form in the physical sector has nonlinear self-dual field strength and couples to external\((2p+1)\)-form field. Explicit forms of Sen theories are also discussed. The Lagrangian for the quadratic theory is separated into two Henneaux–Teitelboim Lagrangians. We also discuss the method of generating explicit nonlinear theories with\(p=1\). Finally, we also show that the M5-brane action in the Sen formulation is separated into a Henneaux–Teitelboim action in unphysical sector and a gauge-fixed PST in physical sector.
We construct new classes of the dynamical black hole solutions in five or higher dimensional Einstein–Maxwell theory, coupled to a dilaton field, in the presence of an arbitrary cosmological constant. The dilaton field interacts non-trivially with the Maxwell field, as well as the cosmological constant, with two arbitrary coupling constants. The solutions are non-stationary, and almost conformally regular everywhere. To construct the solutions, we use the four-dimensional Bianchi type IX geometry, as the base space. We find three different classes of solutions, based on the values of the coupling constants. We notice that our solutions could be asymptotically de-Sitter, anti-de-Sitter or flat. We find the relevant quantities of the solutions, and discuss the properties of the solutions.
Recent studies have increasingly focused on the effect of relativistic motion on quantum coherence. Prior research predominantly examined the influence of relative motion on basis-dependent quantum coherence, underscoring its susceptibility to decoherence under accelerated conditions. Yet, the effect of relativistic motion on basis-independent quantum coherence, which is critical for understanding the intrinsic quantum features of a system, remains an interesting open question. This paper addresses this question by examining how total, collective, and localized coherence are affected by acceleration and coupling strength. Our analysis reveals that both total and collective coherence significantly decrease with increasing acceleration and coupling strength, ultimately vanishing at high levels of acceleration. This underscores the profound impact of Unruh thermal noise. Conversely, localized coherence exhibits relative stability, decreasing to zero only under the extreme condition of infinite acceleration. Moreover, we demonstrate that collective, localized, and basis-independent coherence collectively satisfy the triangle inequality. These findings are crucial for enhancing our understanding of quantum information dynamics in environments subjected to high acceleration and offer valuable insights on the behavior of quantum coherence under relativistic conditions.
The search of the new physics (NP) beyond the Standard Model is one of the most important topics in current high energy physics. With the increasing luminosities at the colliders, the search for NP signals requires the analysis of more and more data, and the efficiency in data processing becomes particularly important. As a machine learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM) is expected to to be useful in the search of NP. Meanwhile, the quantum computing has the potential to offer huge advantages when dealing with large amounts of data, which suggests that quantum SVM (QSVM) is a potential tool in future phenomenological studies of the NP. How to use SVM and QSVM to optimize event selection strategies to search for NP signals are studied in this paper. Taking the tri-photon process at a muon collider as an example, it can be shown that the event selection strategies optimized by the SVM and QSVM are effective in the search of the dimension-8 operators contributing to the anomalous quartic gauge couplings.
This paper investigates the generation and properties of gravitational radiation within the framework of generalized Brans–Dicke (GBD) theory, with a specific emphasis on its manifestation in compact binary systems. The study begins by examining the weak field equations in GBD theory, laying the foundation for subsequent analyses. Solutions to the linearized field equations for point particles are then presented, providing insights into the behavior of gravitational fields in the context of GBD theory. The equation of motion of point mass is explored, shedding light on the dynamics of compact binary systems within the GBD framework. The primary focus of this study lies in the comprehensive exploration of gravitational radiation generated by compact binaries. The energy momentum tensor and the associated gravitational wave (GW) radiation power in GBD theory are investigated, elucidating the relationship between these fundamental concepts. Furthermore, detailed calculations are provided for the GW radiation power originating from both tensor fields and scalar fields. Based on our calculations, both scalar fields contribute to GW radiation by producing dipole radiation. We also study the period derivative of compact binaries in this theory. By comparing with the observational data of the orbital period derivative of the quasicircular white dwarf-neutron star binary PSR J1012+5307, we put bounds on the two parameters of the theory: the Brans–Dicke coupling parameter\(\omega _{0}\)and the mass of geometrical scalar field\(m_f\), resulting in a lower bound\(\omega _{0}>6.09723\times 10^6\)for a massless BD scalar field and the geometrical field whose mass is smaller than\(10^{-29} \text { GeV}\). The obtained bound on\(\omega _0\)is two orders of magnitude stricter than those derived from solar system data. Finally, we find the phase shift that GWs experience in the frequency domain during their propagation. These calculations offer a quantitative understanding of the contributions from different components within the GBD theory, facilitating a deeper comprehension of the overall behavior and characteristics of gravitational radiation.
Assessing the applicability of hydrodynamic expansions close to phase transition points is crucial from either theoretical or phenomenological points of view. We explore this within the gauge/gravity duality, using the Einstein–Klein–Gordon model, a bottom-up string theory construction. This model incorporates a parameter,\(B_4\), that simulates different types of phase transitions in the strongly coupled field theory existing at the boundary. We thoroughly examine the thermodynamics and dynamics of time-dependent, linearized perturbations in the spin-2, spin-1, and spin-0 sectors. Our findings suggest that ‘hydrodynamic series breakdown near transition points” is valid exclusively for second-order phase transitions, not for crossovers or first-order phase transitions. Additionally, we observe that the high-temperature and low-temperature limits of the radius of convergence for the hydrodynamic series (\(q^2_c\)) are equal. We also discover that the relationship\((\text {Max}|q^2_c|)_{\text {spin-2}}< (\text {Max}|q^2_c|)_{\text {spin-0}} < (\text {Max}|q^2_c|)_{\text {spin-1}}\)is consistent for different spin sectors, regardless of the phase transition type. At the chaos point, we observe the emergence of pole-skipping behavior for both gravity and scalar perturbations at\(\omega _n = -2\pi T n i\). Lastly, comparing the chaos momentum with\(q^2_c\), we find that\(q^2_{ps} < q^2_c\), except for extremely high temperatures.
The values of the low-energy constants (LECs) are very important in the chiral perturbation theory. This paper adopts a Bayesian method with the truncation errors to globally fit eight next-to-leading order (NLO) LECsLriand next-to-next-leading order (NNLO) LECsCri. With the estimation of the truncation errors, the fitting results ofLriin the NLO and NNLO are very close. The posterior distributions ofCriindicate the boundary-dependent relations of theseCri. TenCriare weakly dependent on the boundaries and their values are reliable. The otherCriare required more experimental data to constrain their boundaries. Some linear combinations ofCriare also fitted with more reliable posterior distributions. If one knows some more precise values ofCri, some otherCrican be obtained by these values. With these fitting LECs, most observables provide a good convergence, except for theπKscattering lengthsa3/20anda1/20. An example is also introduced to test the improvement of the method. All the computations indicate that considering the truncation errors can improve the global fit greatly, and more prior information can obtain better fitting results. This fitting method can be extended to the other effective field theories and the perturbation theory.
We consider the propagation of photons in a model of a charged scalar Bose-Einstein (BE) condensate. We determine the dispersion relations of the collective modes, as well as the photon polarization tensor and the dielectric constant in the model. Two modes correspond to the transverse photon polarizations, with dispersion relations of the usual form for transverse photons in a plasma. The other two modes, denoted as the\((\pm )\)modes, are combinations of the longitudinal photon and the massive scalar field. Their dispersion relations behave very differently as functions of momentum. The\((+)\)mode dispersion relation increases steadily and remains greater than the momentum as the momentum increases. The dispersion relation of the\((-)\)mode decreases in a given momentum range, with the group velocity being negative in that range, while in another range it increases steadily but remains smaller than the momentum, akin to the situation in a medium with an index of refraction greater than 1. We consider the non-relativistic limit of the\((\pm )\)dispersion relations and discuss some aspects of the results. We also determine the wavefunctions of the\((\pm )\)modes, which are useful to obtain the corrections to the dispersion relations, e.g., imaginary parts due to the damping effects and/or the effects of scattering, due to the interactions with the excitations of the system. The results can be useful in various physical contexts that have been considered in the literature involving the electrodynamics of a charged scalar BE condensate.
In this paper, we calculated the extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) waveform radiated from a binary composed of a massive horizonless object (MHO) and a compact object (CO), where CO is spiraling on a circular equatorial orbit around the MHO. Due to the absent of horizon, there exist the ingoing and outgoing waves near the reflective surface of MHO, which have significantly influence on the evolution of orbital parameters. We observe that there indeed exist the differences of EMRI trajectories between the massive Kerr black hole and MHO cases. By calculating the mismatch of gravitational wave (GW) waveforms from massive black hole (MBH) and MHO, our result indicates that the space-borne gravitational wave detector could distinguish the modified effect of reflectivities from the BH case, which allows to put an upper constraint on the reflectivity\({\mathcal {R}}\)of MHO, at the level of\({\mathcal {R}} > rsim 10^{-4}\).
In the present work, we first regularize a black hole spacetime in modified gravity (MOG) in the presence of the scalar-tensor-vector (STV) field, called the Schwarzschild MOG black hole, under the transformation\(r^2 \rightarrow r^2 + a^2\), known as the Simpson–Visser (SV) spacetime (whereais regularization or black-bounce parameter). The spacetime can represent a black hole and a wormhole. We analyze horizon properties and calculate the effective mass of the spacetime. Also, we find black hole-wormhole regions in black-bounce and MOG parameter spacetime. We also analyze scalar invariants of spacetime, such as the Ricci scalar, the square of the Ricci tensor, and the Kretchmann scalar. We study test particle motion in the SV-MOG spacetime by considering the interaction between the particle and the STV field. We investigate how the STV fields change the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs), energy, and angular momentum of the test particle’s ISCO. It is shown that the ISCO decreases in the presence of the black bounce parameter and increases in the STV field. We also study the collisions of test particles and analyze how the MOG and black-bounce parameters influence the critical angular momentum of colliding particles and their center of mass energy.
With the observed data of the S2 orbit around the black hole Sgr A\(^*\)and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we make a constraint on parameters of a disformal Schwarzschild black hole in quadratic degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. This black hole belongs to a class of non-stealth solutions and owns an extra disformal parameter described the deviation from general relativity. Our results show that the best fit value of the disformal parameter is positive. However, in the range of\(1\sigma \), we also find that general relativity remains to be consistent with the observation of the S2 orbit.
This study investigates the nature of the\(X_0(2900)\)and\(\chi _{c0}(3930)\)based on experimental results of the process\(B^+\)\(\rightarrow \)\(D^+ D^- K^+\). We focus on the S-wave\(D^{*-}K^{*+}\)and\(D_s^+D_s^-\)molecular states, which can be related to the\(X_0(2900)\)and\(\chi _{c0}(3930)\), respectively. Using effective Lagrangians, we construct the potential kernel of the\(D^{*-}K^{*+}\)–\(D^{-}K^{+}\)and\(D_s^+D_s^-\)–\(D^+D^-\)interactions with a one-boson-exchange model, and determine the scattering amplitudes and their poles through a quasipotential Bethe–Salpeter equation approach. By incorporating the potential kernel into the three-body decay process\(B^+\)\(\rightarrow \)\(D^+ D^- K^+\), we evaluate the\(D^-K^+\)and\(D^+D^-\)invariant mass spectra, as well as the Dalitz plot, using Monte Carlo simulation. A satisfactory fit to the\(D^-K^+\)and\(D^+D^-\)invariant mass spectra is achieved after introducing additional Breit–Wigner resonances,\(X_1(2900)\),\(\psi (3770)\), and\(\chi _{c2}(3930)\). Prominent signals of the\(X_0(2900)\)and\(\chi _{c0}(3930)\)states appear as peaks in the\(D^-K^+\)and\(D^+D^-\)invariant mass spectra near 2900 and 3930 MeV, respectively. Clear event concentration from the\(X_0(2900)\)and\(\chi _0(3930)\)is evident as strips in the Dalitz plot. The results suggest that both\(X_0(2900)\)and\(\chi _{c0}(3930)\)can be interpreted as molecular states, with the inclusion of\(X_1(2900)\)and\(\chi _2(3930)\)necessary to describe structures in the\(D^-K^+\)and\(D^+D^-\)invariant mass spectra, respectively.
The Einstein-dilaton-Gauss–Bonnet (EdGB) theory is a modified theory of gravity which include a scalar field to couple with the higher order curvature terms. It has already been constrained with various observations include the gravitational wave (GW) with LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration. In this work, we study the capability for space-borne GW detectors to constrain the EdGB theory using the signal of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRIs). We use the “numerical kludge (NK)” method to construct the waveform of EMRI in the EdGB theory, focusing on the case when the central black hole is spinless. We then study how a future space-borne gravitational wave detector, TianQin, for example, can place constraints on the EdGB theory through the detection of EMRIs. With the analysis using mismatch and Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), we find that the EdGB parameter\(\sqrt{\alpha }\)is expected to be constrained to the level of\(\sim \mathcal {O}(0.1)\)km.
In this paper, we investigate the topological numbers of the four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole,d-dimensional Reissner–Nordström (RN) black hole,d-dimensional singly rotating Kerr black hole and five-dimensional Gauss–Bonnet black hole via the Rényi statistics. We find that the topological number calculated via the Rényi statistics is different from that obtained from the Gibbs–Boltzmann (GB) statistics. However, what is interesting is that the topological classifications of different black holes are consistent in both the Rényi and GB statistics: the four-dimensional RN black hole, four-dimensional and five-dimensional singly rotating Kerr black holes, five-dimensional charged and uncharged Gauss–Bonnet black holes belong to the same kind of topological class, and the four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole and\(d(>5)\)-dimensional singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to another kind of topological class. In addition, our results suggest that the topological numbers calculated via the Rényi statistics in asymptotically flat spacetime background are equal to those calculated from the standard GB statistics in asymptotically AdS spacetime background, which provides more evidence for the connection between the nonextensivity of the Rényi parameter\(\lambda \)and the cosmological constant\(\Lambda \).
This article investigates the geodesic structure and deflection angle of charged black holes in the presence of a nonzero vacuum expectation value background of the Kalb–Ramond field. Topics explored include null and timelike geodesics, energy extraction by collisions, and the motion of charged particles. The photon sphere radius is calculated and plotted to examine the effects of both the black hole charge (Q) and the Lorentz-violating parameter (b) on null geodesics. The effective potential for timelike geodesics is analyzed, and second-order analytical orbits are derived. We further show that the combined effects of Lorentz-violating parameter and electric charge can mimic a Kerr black hole spin parameter up to its maximum values, i.e.,\(a/M \sim 1\)thus suggesting that the current precision of measurements of highly spinning black hole candidates may not rule out the effect of Lorentz-violating parameter. The center of mass energy of colliding particles is also considered, demonstrating a decrease with increasing Lorentz-violating parameter. Circular orbiting particles of charged particles are discovered, with the minimum radius for a stable circular orbit decreasing as bothbandQincrease. Results show that this circular orbit is particularly sensitive to changes in the Lorentz-violating parameter. Additionally, a timelike particle trajectory is demonstrated as a consequence of the combined effects of parametersbandQ. Finally, the light deflection angle is analyzed using the weak field limit approach to determine the Lorentz-breaking effect, employing the Gauss–Bonnet theorem for computation. Findings are visualized with appropriate plots and thoroughly discussed.
We study the sphaleron solutions in two deformations of the\(\phi ^6\)model and analyze the oscillons originated from them. We find that the presence of internal modes plays a crucial role in the sphaleron collapse. The positive internal modes triggered by a squeezing of the sphaleron are able to change the direction of collapse. We provide an analytical understanding behind this phenomenon.
Einstein's expression‘Drama of Ideas’to describe the history of fundamental physics is especially suitable for the problem of quantum gravity (QG). The problem was identified by Einstein in 1916 based on an empirico-cosmological argument that was cosmologically flawed and empirically immeasurable. In 1929, the problem was strikingly underestimated by prominent figures in quantum theory, W. Heisenberg and W. Pauli. In 1929, Bohr, basing on the puzzling results of recent nuclear experiments and theoretical quantum limitations, hypothesized that the law of conservation of energy does not hold in nuclear physics. The young Russian physicist Landau enthusiastically supported Bohr's ‘beautiful idea’ and in 1931 proposed its theoretical justification, which, however, was rejected by Bohr. In late 1932, Landau realized that Bohr's hypothesis was incompatible with Einstein's theory of gravity. This meeting of two fundamental theories prompted Matvei Bronstein to investigate the quantization of gravity in-depth. In 1935, he proposed the first physical theory of QG for the weak gravity and revealed how deep the QG problem was for strong gravity. He showed that the gravitational field at a point in space–time is in principle unobservable and concluded that a complete theory of QG would require the ‘rejection of a Riemannian geometry…and perhaps also the rejection of our ordinary concepts of space and time, replacing them by some much deeper and non-evident concepts’. Until now, despite thousands of publications on QG, the problem remains a great challenge in theoretical physics.
The yields of\(K^0_S\)mesons have been measured in inelasticp+pinteractions at incident projectile momenta of 31, 40 and 80\(\text {Ge}\hspace{-1.00006pt}\text {V}\!/\!c\)(\(\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7, 8.8\)and 12.3\(\text {Ge}\hspace{-1.00006pt}\text {V}\), respectively). The data were recorded by the NA61\(/\)SHINE spectrometer at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron and the\(K^0_S\)mesons identified via their decays into\(\pi ^{+} \pi ^{-}\)pairs. Double-differential distributions are presented as function of transverse momentum and rapidity. The mean multiplicities of\(K^0_S\)mesons were determined to be\((5.95 \pm 0.19 (stat) \pm 0.30 (sys)) \times 10^{-2}\)at 31\(\text {Ge}\hspace{-1.00006pt}\text {V}\!/\!c\),\((7.61 \pm 0.13 (stat) \pm 0.43 (sys)) \times 10^{-2}\)at 40\(\text {Ge}\hspace{-1.00006pt}\text {V}\!/\!c\)and\((11.58 \pm 0.12 (stat) \pm 0.55 (sys)) \times 10^{-2}\)at 80\(\text {Ge}\hspace{-1.00006pt}\text {V}\!/\!c\). The results on\(K^{0}_{S}\)production are compared with the production of charged kaons in corresponding reactions and with model calculations (Epos1.99, SMASH 2.0 and PHSD) as well as with published data from other experiments.
Giant planet migration appears widespread among planetary systems in our Galaxy. However, the timescales of this process, which reflect the underlying dynamical mechanisms, are not well constrained, even within the Solar System. As planetary migration scatters smaller bodies onto intersecting orbits, it would have resulted in an epoch of enhanced bombardment in the Solar System’s asteroid belt. Here, to accurately and precisely quantify the timescales of migration, we interrogate thermochronologic data from asteroidal meteorites, which record the thermal imprint of energetic collisions. We present a database of40K–40Ar system ages from chondrite meteorites and evaluate it with an asteroid-scale thermal code coupled to a Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion. Simulations require bombardment to reproduce the observed age distribution and identify a bombardment event beginning\(11.{3}_{-6.6}^{+9.5}\, {\mathrm{Myr}}\)after the Sun formed (50% credible interval). Our results associate a giant planet instability in our Solar System with the dissipation of the gaseous protoplanetary disk.
A search for leptoquark pair production decaying into\(te^- \bar{t}e^+\)or\(t\mu ^- \bar{t}\mu ^+\)in final states with multiple leptons is presented. The search is based on a dataset ofppcollisions at\(\sqrt{s}=13~\text {TeV} \)recorded with the ATLAS detector during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\(^{-1}\). Four signal regions, with the requirement of at least three light leptons (electron or muon) and at least two jets out of which at least one jet is identified as coming from ab-hadron, are considered based on the number of leptons of a given flavour. The main background processes are estimated using dedicated control regions in a simultaneous fit with the signal regions to data. No excess above the Standard Model background prediction is observed and 95% confidence level limits on the production cross section times branching ratio are derived as a function of the leptoquark mass. Under the assumption of exclusive decays into\(te^{-}\)(\(t\mu ^{-}\)), the corresponding lower limit on the scalar mixed-generation leptoquark mass\(m_{\textrm{LQ}_{\textrm{mix}}^{\textrm{d}}}\)is at 1.58 (1.59) TeV and on the vector leptoquark mass\(m_{{\tilde{U}}_1}\)at 1.67 (1.67) TeV in the minimal coupling scenario and at 1.95 (1.95) TeV in the Yang–Mills scenario.
In this paper, we investigate the polarization images of a synchrotron-emitting fluid ring surrounding a static hairy black hole within the framework of Horndeski’s theory. Our findings indicate that the characteristics of these polarization images are predominantly influenced by the hairy parameter, alongside the magnetic field near the black hole, the fluid’s velocity, and the observer’s inclination angle. Specifically, the hairy parameter primarily affects the polarized intensity and the apparent radius of the ring in the images. Conversely, the impacts of the magnetic field, fluid velocity, and inclination angle on the polarization images are found to be independent of the hairy parameter and closely resemble those observed in the context of Schwarzschild black holes. Additionally, the polarization direction is significantly influenced by the magnetic field orientation, while the inclination angle crucially determines the apparent flatness of the images. Variations in the fluid velocity direction also markedly affect the trend in polarized intensity. Furthermore, we explore how these parameters influence the Stokes\(Q-U\)loops, revealing distinct behaviors in response to changes in the aforementioned variables. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of the intricate dynamics and observational signatures of black holes within alternative gravitational theories.
New one-parameter models of non-rotating dynamical particles are derived as isotropic solutions of Einstein’s equations with perfect fluid in space-times with FLRW asymptotic behaviour, thus generalizing the models recently proposed by Cotăescu (Eur. Phys. J. C 82:86, 2022). These particles are produced by central singularities of the fluid density but without changing the pressure of the asymptotic FLRW space-times. The principal features of these models are investigated using a brief graphical analysis to elucidate the role of the new free parameter. The conclusion is that this gives rise to families of models which behave as non-rotating black holes in the physical space domain bordered by the black hole and cosmological horizons.
Causal set theory offers a simple and elegant picture of discrete physics. But the vast majority of causal sets look nothing at all like continuum spacetimes, and must be excluded in some way to obtain a realistic theory. I describe recent results showing that almost all non-manifoldlike causal sets are, in fact, very strongly suppressed in the gravitational path integral. This does not quite demonstrate the emergence of a continuum—we do not yet understand the remaining unsuppressed causal sets well enough—but it is a significant step in that direction.
We consider a massless and minimally coupled self interacting quantum scalar field in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime. The scalar potential is taken to be a hybrid of cubic and quartic self interactions,\(V(\phi )= \lambda \phi ^4/4!+\beta \phi ^3/3!\)(\(\lambda >0\)). Compared to the earlier well studied\(\beta =0\)case, the present potential has a rolling down effect due to the\(\phi ^3\)term, along with the usual bounding effect due to the\(\phi ^4\)term. We begin by constructing the Schwinger–Dyson equation for the scalar Feynman propagator up to two loop, at\({\mathcal {O}}(\lambda )\),\({{\mathcal {O}}}(\beta ^2)\),\({{\mathcal {O}}}(\lambda ^2)\)and\({\mathcal {O}}(\lambda \beta ^2)\). Using this equation, we consider first the local part of the scalar self energy and compute the rest mass squared of the scalar field, dynamically generated via the late time non-perturbative secular logarithms, by resumming the daisy-like graphs. The logarithms associated here are sub-leading, compared to those associated with the non-local, leading terms. We also argue that unlike the quartic case, considering merely the one loop results for the purpose of resummation does not give us any sensible result here. We next construct the non-perturbative two particle irreducible effective action up to three loop and derive from it the Schwinger–Dyson equation once again. This equation is satisfied by the non-perturbative Feynman propagator. By series expanding this propagator, the resummed local part of the self energy is shown to yield the same dynamical mass as that of the above. We next use this equation to resum the effect of the non-local part of the scalar self energy in the Feynman propagator, and show that even though the perturbatively corrected propagator shows secular growth at late times, there exists one resummed solution which is vanishing for large spacelike separations, in qualitative agreement with the well known result found via the stochastic formalism.
This paper investigates the axial gravitational perturbations originating from spherically symmetric black holes inf(R) gravity, along with the optical appearance of such a black hole. The aim is to search for evidence of the existence of these black holes in astrophysical observations and thereby test the correctness of thef(R) theory. In literature Kalita and Mukhopadhyay (Eur Phys J C 79:877, 2019), the spherically symmetric black hole metric inf(R) gravity is obtained. By comparing it with the metric for spherically symmetric black holes in general relativity, we find that the modification of gravity due tof(R) can be described in this black hole spacetime using a parameter\(C_f\). Next, we study axial gravitational perturbations in this spacetime and successfully derive a decoupled axial perturbation equation. We also discuss the impact off(R) gravity on the quasi-normal mode frequencies. Additionally, we have also investigated the optical appearance of the black hole. We discuss the impact of the parameter\(C_f\)on the observable characteristics of the accretion disk. In principle, both of these effects can be observed using gravitational wave detectors and astronomical telescopes.
In this article, we develop a new class of solutions that describe stellar structures of recently observed pulsars. We adopt the condition of the vanishing complexity proposed by Herrera (Phys Rev D 97:044010, 2018) and an appropriate metric potential for generating the solutions. The solutions which are obtained from the complexity-free conditions, are physically well-behaved and satisfy all the rigorous conditions to describe static and spherically symmetric realistic compact objects. The features of observed anisotropic compact stars including Vela X-1, LMC X-4, Cen X-3, and EXO 1785-248 are validated with our model. It is further shown that the solutions supporting matter configurations are physically plausible, stable with positive anisotropy, and in an equilibrium state as verified by investigating the generalized TOV equation in the case of our model.
We formulate the variance-based uncertainty relations (URs) via the Robertson’s inequality, for a 2-particle entangled system constrained on a torus and subject to a stationary magnetic field\(\mathcal {\vec {B}}\). We explore the system’s parameter space and show that these new URs have field-tunable uncertainty bounds. Our analysis reveals that\(\mathcal {\vec {A}}\)(vector potential) induces a phase shift in the state, due to the Aharonov–Bohm effect, leading to a perturbed system dynamics which results in asymmetric product of variance (\(\mathcal {POV}\)). Additionally, we give the critical range of\(\mathcal {\vec {A}}\)and\(\mathcal {\vec {B}}\)where the system acts as an entanglement amplifier; this amplification is also discussed under various geometric parameters. The possibility of reducing the\(\mathcal {POV}\)of the conjugate pair [q,p] below the known benchmark value by the Generalized Uncertainty Relation (GUR) is also demonstrated. Finally, we check the susceptibility of state coherence to\(\mathcal {\vec {B}}\)by saturating the angular momentum uncertainty relation and identify the critical coherence value\({\mathcal {B}}_c\)such that when\({\mathcal {B}}\ne {\mathcal {B}}_c\), the state decoheres.
The quest for supersymmetric (SUSY) particles is among the main search channels currently pursued at the LHC. Particularly, electroweak (EW) particles with masses as low as a few hundred GeV are still viable. Recent searches for the “golden channel”,\(pp \rightarrow \tilde{\chi }_{2}^0 \tilde{\chi }_{1}^\pm \rightarrow \tilde{\chi }_{1}^0 Z^{(*)} \, \tilde{\chi }_{1}^0 W^{\pm (*)}\)show consistent excesses between ATLAS and CMS in the 2 lepton, 3-lepton and mono-jet searches, assumingand\(\Delta m:= m_{\tilde{\chi }_{2}^0} - m_{\tilde{\chi }_{1}^0} \approx 20 \,\, \textrm{GeV}\). This mass configuration arises naturally in SUSY scenarios with wino/bino Dark Matter (DM) or higgsino DM. In these scenarios the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), assumed to be the lightest neutralino,\(\tilde{\chi }_{1}^0\), as a DM candidate is in good agreement with the observed limits on the DM content of the universe, as well as with negative results from Direct Detection (DD) experiments. We analyze these two scenarios with respect to the observed excesses, taking into account all relevant experimental constraints. We show that in particular wino/bino DM with different signs of theSU(2) andU(1) soft SUSY-breaking parameters can describe well the experimental excesses, while being in agreement with all other constraints.
In this paper, we explore the existence of various non-singular compact stellar solutions influenced by the Maxwell field within the matter-geometry coupling based modified gravity. We start this analysis by considering a static spherically symmetric spacetime which is associated with the isotropic matter distribution. We then determine the field equations corresponding to two specific functions of this modified theory. Along with these models, we also adopt different forms of the matter Lagrangian. We observe several unknowns in these equations such as the metric potentials, charge and fluid parameters. Thus, the embedding class-one condition and a particular realistic equation of state is used to construct their corresponding solutions. The former condition provides the metric components possessing three constants, and we calculate them through junction conditions. Further, four developed models are graphically analyzed under different parametric values. Finally, we find all our developed solutions well-agreeing with the physical requirements, offering valuable insights for future explorations of the stellar compositions in this theory.
In this paper, we delve into the study of thermodynamics and phase transition of charged Gauss–Bonnet black holes within the context of anti-de Sitter space, with particular emphasis on the central charge’s role within the dual conformal field theory (CFT). We employ a holographic methodology that interprets the cosmological constant and the Newton constant as thermodynamic variables, leading to the derivation of a modified first law of thermodynamics that incorporates the thermodynamic volume and pressure. Our findings reveal that the central charge of the CFT is intrinsically linked to the variation of these constants, and its stability can be ensured by simultaneous adjustment of these constants. We further explore the phase structures of the black holes, utilizing the free energy. Our research uncovers the existence of a critical value of the central charge, beyond which the phase diagram displays a first-order phase transition between small and large black holes. We also delve into the implications of our findings on the complexity of the CFT. Our conclusions underscore the significant role of the central charge in the holographic thermodynamics and phase transition of charged Gauss–Bonnet black holes. Furthermore, we conclude that while the central charge considered provides suitable and satisfactory solutions for this black hole in 4 and 5 dimensions, it becomes necessary to introduce a unique central charge for this structure of modified gravity. In essence, the central charge in holographic thermodynamics is not a universal value and requires modification in accordance with different modified gravities. Consequently, the physics of the problem will significantly deviate from the one discussed in this article, indicating a rich and complex landscape for future work.
In an effort to understand nuclei in terms of quarks we develop an effective theory to low-energy quantum chromodynamics in which a single quark contained in a nucleus is driven by a mean field due to other constituents of the nucleus. We analyze the reason why the number ofdquarks in light stable nuclei is much the same as that ofuquarks, while for heavier nuclei beginning with\(\mathrm{{}^{40}_{20}Ca}\), the number ofdquarks is greater than the number ofuquarks. To account for the finiteness of the periodic table, we invoke a version of gauge/gravity duality between the dynamical affair in stable nuclei and that in extremal black holes. With the assumption that the end of stability for heavy nuclei is dual to the occurrence of a naked singularity, we find that the maximal number of protons in stable nuclei is\(Z_{\max }^{\textrm{H}}\approx 82\).
We find a new solution to calculate the orbital periastron advance of a test body subject to a central gravitational force field for relativistic theories and models beyond Einstein. This analitycal formula has general validity that includes all the post-Newtonian (PN) contributions to the dynamics and is useful for high-precision gravitational tests. The solution is directly applicable to corrective potentials of various forms, without the need for numerical integration. Later, we apply it to the scalar tensor fourth order gravity (STFOG) and noncommutative geometry, providing corrections to the Newtonian potential of Yukawa-like form\(V(r)=\alpha \frac{e^{-\beta r}}{r}\), and we conduct the first analysis involving all the PN terms for these theories. The same work is performed with a Schwarzschild geometry perturbed by a Quintessence Field, leading to a power-law potential\(V(r)=\alpha _q {r}^q\). Finally, by using astrometric data of the Solar System planetary precessions and those of the S2 star around Sgr A*, we infer new theoretical constraints and improvements in the bounds for\(\beta \). The resulting simulated orbits turn out to be compatible with general relativity.
We argue that the existence of the electroweak monopole predicts the existence of the electroweak string in the standard model made of monopole–antimonopole pair separated infinitely apart, which carry the quantized magnetic flux\(4 \pi n/e\). We show how to construct such quantized magnetic flux string solution. Our result strongly indicates that genuine fundamental electromagnetic string could exist in nature which could actually be detected. We discuss the physical implications of our result in cosmology.
We systematically investigate the mass spectrum and two-body open-charm strong decays of charmonium states in a coupled-channel model where the\(^3P_0\)quark-antiquark pair creation mechanism is employed. The results of masses, mass shifts, proportions of the\(c\bar{c}\)component, and open-charm decay widths are provided. TheS-Dwave mixing angles and di-electric decay widths for vector mesons are also presented. Based on our results, we find that the\(\psi (3770)\),\(\psi (4040)\),\(\psi (4160)\),\(\psi (4360)\), and\(\psi (4415)\)can be assigned as the\(1^3D_1\)-,\(3^3S_1\)-,\(2^3D_1\)-,\(4^3S_1\)-, and\(3^3D_1\)-dominated charmonium states, respectively. The\(\psi _3(3842)\)is a good candidate of the\(\psi _3(1D)\)charmonium state. The calculated mass and strong decay width of\(\chi _{c1}(2P)\)with significant continuum contribution (\(\sim \)57%) favor the charmonium interpretation for the mysterious\(\chi _{c1}(3872)\). When considering the large uncertainty in the observed decay width, the possibility to assign the\(\chi _{c0}(3860)\)as the\(\chi _{c0}(2P)\)charmonium state cannot be ruled out. One may describe well the properties of\(\chi _{c2}(3930)\)with the\(\chi _{c2}(2P)\)charmonium. The predictions on properties of other\(c\bar{c}\)states can be tested by future experiments.
We investigate how the Next-Two-Higgs Doublet Model extension (N2HDM) should look if we are to address the naturalness problem using dimensional regularization. In such a model, new Higgs states are predicted, namely: three CP-even\(h_{1,2,3}\), one CP-oddA, and a pair of charged Higgs boson\(H^\pm \). Our calculations of the overall quadratic divergences have been performed with full consistency with the latest data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) concerning the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson, alongside precision electroweak data tests and lower mass limits on charged Higgs boson. It is shown that the quadratically divergent quantum corrections\(\delta _i\)(i=1,2,3) for the three CP-even Higgs bosons are controllably small, though hidden fine-tuning might still be required. This reveals a significant impact on the model parameter space, Higgs spectrum mass and notably the singlet-doublet admixture.
With just the Standard Model Higgs doublet, there are only three types of seesaw models that generate light Majorana neutrino masses at tree level after electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, if there exist additional TeV scalars acquiring vacuum expectation values, coupled with heavier fermionic multiplets, several new seesaw models become possible. These new seesaws are the primary focus of this study and correspond to the tree-level ultraviolet completions of the effective operators studied in a companion publication. We are interested in the genuine cases, in which the standard seesaw contributions are absent. In addition to the tree-level generation of neutrino masses, we also consider the one-loop contributions. Furthermore, we construct low-energy versions that exhibit a very rich phenomenology. Specifically, we scrutinise the generation of dimension-6 operators and explore their implications, including non-unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix, non-universal\(Z-\)boson interactions, and lepton flavor violation. Finally, we provide (Generalised) Scotogenic-like variants that incorporate viable dark matter candidates.
The propagation directions of cosmic rays travelling through interstellar space are repeatedly scattered by fluctuating interstellar magnetic fields. The nature of this scattering is a major unsolved problem in astrophysics, one that has resisted solution largely due to a lack of direct observational constraints on the scattering rate. Here we show that very high-energy γ-ray emission from the globular cluster Terzan 5, which has unexpectedly been found to be displaced from the cluster, presents a direct probe of this process. We show that this displacement is naturally explained by cosmic rays accelerated in the bow shock around the cluster, which then propagate a finite distance before scattering processes re-orient enough of them towards Earth to produce a detectable γ-ray signal. The angular distance between the cluster and the signal places tight constraints on the scattering rate, which we show are consistent with a model in which scattering is primarily due to excitation of magnetic waves by the cosmic rays themselves. The analysis method we develop here will make it possible to use sources with similarly displaced non-thermal X-ray and tera-electronvolt γ-ray signals as direct probes of cosmic ray scattering across a range of Galactic environments.
Extensions of the Standard Model featuring light vector bosons have been explored with the goal of resolving certain tensions between theory and experiment, among them the discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon,\(\Delta a_{\mu }\). In particular, this is the case of a minimal construction including a leptophilic, strictly flavour violating, vector boson\(Z^\prime \). These new vector bosons are also well-motivated dark matter portals, with non-trivial couplings to stable, weakly interacting states which can account for the correct dark matter density. Here we study the prospects of a Standard Model extension (via a vector boson and a fermionic dark matter candidate) concerning signatures at the LHC, and at future lepton and hadron colliders. We discuss the cross-sections of several processes leading to same- and opposite-sign muon-tau lepton pairs in the final state, as well as final states with missing energy (in the form of neutrinos and/or dark matter). Our findings suggest that a future muon collider offers the best prospects to probe this model (together with searches for dilepton pairs and missing energy signatures at the FCC-ee running at theZ-pole); moreover, the complementarity of the different future high-energy colliders is also paramount to probing distinct\(Z^\prime \)mass regimes.
A novel approach is proposed to probe the nature of the double charm tetraquark through the prompt production asymmetry between\(T_{\bar{c}\bar{c}}^-\)and\(T_{cc}^+\)inppcollisions. When comparing two theoretical pictures, i.e. the compact tetraquark and hadronic molecular pictures, we find that the former one exhibits a significantly larger production asymmetry, enabling the unambiguous determination of the tetraquark’s internal structure. Additionally, distinctive differences in the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of\(T_{\bar{c}\bar{c}}^-\)and\(T_{cc}^+\)cross sections emerge, particularly at\(p_\textrm{T}\approx 2~\textrm{GeV}\)and\(y\approx \pm 6\)at a center-of-mass energy of 14\(~\textrm{TeV}\). The insignificant asymmetry in hadronic molecular picture is because that hadronic molecules are produced in hadronic phase, where the phase space of their constituents needs to be taken into account rigorously. Our work can be extended to the exploration of other double heavy tetraquark candidates, offering a versatile approach to advance our understanding of exotic hadrons.
We derive the exact solutions for electrically charged black holes both in the absence and presence of a cosmological constant in the gravitational theory with Lorentz violation induced by a background Kalb–Ramond (KR) field. The corresponding thermodynamic properties are investigated. It is found that the standard first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr formula remain valid for the charged KR black holes. Nevertheless, the Lorentz-violating effect influences their ranges of local thermodynamic stability and the first- and second-order phase transition points. Furthermore, to examine the impact of Lorentz violation on the motion of test particles in the spacetime, we analyze the shadow and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of these black holes. Our results reveal that both the shadow and ISCO radii exhibit a high sensitivity to the Lorentz-violating parameter\(\ell \), with a decrease observed as\(\ell \)increases.
We present the open-sourceSIMUnetcode, designed to fit Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) Wilson coefficient alongside Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) of the proton.SIMUnetcan perform SMEFT global fits, as well as simultaneous fits of the PDFs and of an arbitrarily large number of SMEFT degrees of freedom, by including both PDF-dependent and PDF-independent observables.SIMUnetcan also be used to determine whether the effects of any New Physics models can be fitted away in a global fit of PDFs.SIMUnetis built upon the open-sourceNNPDFcode and is released together with documentation, and tutorials. To illustrate the functionalities of the new tool, we present a new global analysis of the SMEFT Wilson coefficients accounting for their interplay with the PDFs. We increment our previous analysis of the LHC Run II top quark data with both (i) the Higgs production and decay rates data from the LHC, and (ii) the precision electroweak and diboson measurements from LEP and the LHC.
Extended teleparallel gravity, characterized by functionF(Q), whereQis the non-metricity scalar, is one of the most promising approaches to general relativity. In this paper, we reexamine a specific dynamical dark energy model, which is indistinguishable from the\(\Lambda \)CDM model at the present time and exhibits a special event in the future, withinF(Q) gravity. To constrain the free parameters of the model, we perform Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, using the last data from\(\hbox {Pantheon}^{+}\)and the latest measurements of the H(z) parameter, combined. On the basis of this analysis, we find that our dynamical dark energy model, in the context of F(Q) gravity, lies in the quintessence regime rather than in the phantom regime, as in the case of general relativity. Furthermore, this behavior affects the future expansion of the Universe, as it becomes decelerating at a\(1\sigma \)confidence level for\(z<-0.5\), showing a bounce at\(z_{\text {B}}\approx -0.835\). We support our conclusion with a cosmographic analysis.
In this study, we explore how a fermion–antifermion (\(f\overline{f}\)) pair interacts via an exponentially decaying potential. Using a covariant one-time two-body Dirac equation, we examine their relative motion in a three-dimensional flat background. Our approach leads to coupled equations governing their behavior, resulting in a general second-order wave equation. Through this, we derive analytical solutions by establishing quantization conditions for pair formation, providing insights into their dynamics. Notably, we find that such interacting\(f\overline{f}\)systems are unstable and decay over time, with the decay time depending on the Compton wavelength of the fermions.
The main objective of this article is to investigate the viability of bouncing cosmological scenarios using different forms of scale factors with perfect matter configuration in the framework of extended symmetric teleparallel theory. This modified proposal is defined by the functionf(Q,T), whereQcharacterizes non-metricity andTdenotes the trace of energy-momentum tensor. We investigate the modified field equations of this theory using different parametric values of the Hubble parameter and non-metricity to derive viable solutions. These solutions are relevant in various cosmological bounce models such as symmetric-bounce, super-bounce, oscillatory-bounce, matter-bounce and exponential-bounce models. Furthermore, we examine the behavior of energy density and pressure to analyze the characteristics of dark energy. A comprehensive analysis is also conducted to explore the behavior of the equation of state parameter and deceleration parameter to examine the evolutionary eras of the cosmos. Our findings show that thef(Q,T) gravity describes the cosmic expansion in the vicinity of the bouncing point during the early and late times of cosmic evolution.
We analyse an-dimensional Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) quantization framework, characterized by a non-commutative nature of the configurational variables. First, we identify a set of states which are maximally localized only along a single direction, at the expense of being less localized in all the other ones. Subsequently, in order to recover information about localization on the whole configuration space, we use the only state of the theory which exhibits maximal localization simultaneously in every direction to construct a satisfactory quasi-position representation, by virtue of a suitable translational operator. The resultant quantum framework is then applied to model the dynamics of the Bianchi I cosmology. The corresponding Wheeler–DeWitt equation is reduced to Schrödinger dynamics for the two anisotropy degrees of freedom, using a WKB representation for the volume-like variable of the Universe, in accordance with the Vilenkin scenario. The main result of our cosmological implementation of the constructed quantum theory demonstrates how the dynamics of a wave packet peaked at some point in the configuration space represented in the quasi-position variables favours as the most probable configuration exactly the initial one for a relatively long time, if compared with the ordinary quantum theory. This preference arises from the different dynamical behavior exhibited by wave packets in the two quantum theories.
The Friedberg–Lee–Sirlin (FLS) model is a well-known renormalizable theory of scalar fields that provides for the existence of non-topological solitons. Since this model was proposed, numerous works have been dedicated to studying its classical configurations and its general suitability for various physical problems in cosmology, quantum chromodynamics, etc. In this paper, we study how Q-balls in effective field theory (EFT) reproduce non-topological solitons in the full FLS theory. We obtain an analytical description of the simplified model and compare the results with numerical calculations and perturbation theory. We also study the condensation of charged bosons on the domain wall. A full numerical solution allows us to check the EFT methods for this problem. The latter analysis is based on the application of EFT methods to significantly inhomogeneous configurations. We give an interpretation of the results in terms of the shifted boson mass and the vacuum rearrangement.
We present shower formation constraints on the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) energy scale for photons with a cubic dispersion relation from recent gamma-ray observations in the 100 TeV–PeV energy range by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We assume a Myers–Pospelov effective field theory framework, and calculate the suppression for the Bethe–Heitler process which is mainly responsible for the formation of photon-initiated atmospheric showers. Comparing the high-energy photon events with the suppressed flux predictions, we obtain\(95\%\)CL constraints on the LIV energy scale. The obtained shower constraint\(E_\textrm{LIV} \gtrsim \mathcal {O} \left( 10^{20} \text{ GeV }\right) \)is significantly weaker than existing birefringence constraints but is independent.
The Regge–Gribov model of the pomeron and odderon in nontrivial transverse space is studied by the renormalization group technique. The single-loop approximation is adopted. Five real fixed points are found, and the high-energy behavior of the propagators is correspondingly calculated. As without the odderon, the asymptotic is modulated by logarithms of energy in certain rational powers. Movement of coupling constants away from the fixed points is investigated both analytically (close to the fixed points) and numerically (far away). In the former case, attraction occurs only in restricted domains of initial coupling constants. More generally, in one third of the cases the coupling constants instead grow large, indicating the breakdown of the single-loop approximation.
The first observation of\(\mathcal {B}\left( B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu \nu \right) \)by the Belle II experiment lies almost\(3\sigma \)away from the Standard Model expectation. In this letter we study this result in the SMEFT, extended by a light right-handed neutrino. We explore the correlations between the measured decay rate and other observables, such as\(\mathcal {B}\left( B\rightarrow K^*\nu \nu \right) \)and\(F_L\left( B\rightarrow K^*\nu \nu \right) \), showing that they could disentangle among scenarios involving left-handed neutrinos and those with the right-handed ones. Furthermore, we find that the high-\(p_T\)tails of Drell–Yan processes studied at LHC provide important constraints that help us exclude some of the scenarios consistent with the Belle II result.
Kalb–Ramond gravity is expected to show the signatures of the low energy limit of the Lorentz violating extension of the standard model of particle physics. To understand the theory further, we study the circular geodesics belonging to a class of exact solutions [found recently by Lessa, Silva, Maluf, Almeida (LSMA)] by posing them as a Hamiltonian dynamical autonomous system. The analysis on the phase space for relevant values of the Lorentz violating parameters reveals for the first time a wealth of novel information that include prediction of homoclinic orbits, saddle points, separatrices that are not available from the conventional analysis. Their image on the actual physical space is discussed.
This work presents analytical black hole solutions for a coupled Einstein–Born–Infeld–Scalar gravity system in AdS spacetime with two different non-minimal coupling functionsf(z). For both solutions, we establish the regularity of the scalar field and curvature scalars outside the horizon. For one of the considered coupling cases, thermodynamic analysis in the canonical ensemble reveals stability across all temperatures, while the other case exhibits the Hawking/Page phase transition between the stable large phase of the black hole and thermal-AdS. We investigate the effect of the scalar hair parameter and black hole charge on the phase transition temperature and observe that the critical values of the scalar hair and the charge parameters constrain the feasibility of Hawking/Page phase transition.
We describe 5D dynamical cosmological solutions of the stabilized holographic dilaton and their role in completion of the conformal phase transition. This analysis corresponds, via the AdS/CFT dictionary, to a study of out-of-equilibrium dynamics where trajectories of the dilaton do not depend solely on thermodynamic quantities in the early universe, but have sensitivity also to initial conditions. Unlike the well-studied thermal transition, which requires quantum tunneling of an infrared brane through the surface of an AdS-Schwarzschild horizon, our approach instead invokes an early epoch in which the cosmology is fully 5-dimensional, with highly relativistic brane motion and with Rindler horizons obscuring the infrared brane at early times. In this context, we demonstrate the existence of a large class of natural initial conditions that seed trajectories where the brane simply passes through the Rindler horizon and into the basin of attraction of the stabilized dilaton potential. This corresponds to successful completion of the phase transition without sacrificing perturbativity of the 5D theory.
In principle, the local classification of spacetimes is always possible using the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm. However, in practice, the process of determining equivalence of two spacetimes relies on determining if a set of equations has a solution. Depending on the form of the equations this may be undecideable. Furthemore, if a solution does exist the equations may still be unsolvable in some way. In the case that spacetimes admit Killing vector fields with non-trivial orbits, we propose a new set of invariant quantities, called Killing invariants. These invariants will allow for the sub-classification of spacetimes admitting the same group of symmetries and will, in principle, be substantially less complicated than other sets of invariants. We apply this approach to the class of static spherically symmetric geometries as an illustrative example.
Jet production from hadronic Higgs decays at future lepton colliders will have significantly different phenomenological implications than jet production via off-shell photon andZ-boson decays, owing to the fact that Higgs bosons decay to both pairs of quarks and gluons. We compute observables involving flavoured jets in hadronic Higgs decays to three partons at Born level including next-to-leading order corrections in QCD (i.e., up to\(\mathcal {O}(\alpha _\textrm{s}^2))\). The calculation is performed in the framework of an effective theory in which the Higgs boson couples directly to gluons and masslessb-quarks retaining a non-vanishing Yukawa coupling. For the energy of the leading and subleading flavoured jet, the angular separation and the invariant mass of the leadingb–\(\bar{b}\)pair, we contrast the results obtained in both Higgs-decay categories and using either of the infrared-safe flavoured jet algorithms flavour-\(k_{\textrm{T}}\)and flavour-dressing.
We study a model of the neutron star in\(\kappa \)-deformed space-time in the presence of the cosmological constant (\(\Lambda \)). The Einstein tensor and the energy-momentum tensor are generalized to\(\kappa \)-deformed space-time and we construct the field equations with the cosmological constant. Considering the interior of the star to be a perfect fluid as in the commutative case, we find the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations with the inclusion of the cosmological constant in\(\kappa \)-deformed space-time. The behavior of the maximum allowed mass of the star and its radius are studied with the variation in the cosmological constant as well as the deformation parameter. We see that the non-commutativity enhances the mass of the star and its maximum mass increases with a decrease in the cosmological constant. The maximum mass varies from 3.44 to\(3.68\,\text {M}_{\odot }\)as\(\Lambda \)varies from\(10^{-10}\)to\(10^{-15}\,\text {m}^{-2}\). We also obtain the compactness factor and surface redshift of the star. We observe that the compactness of the star increases as the cosmological constant decreases, whereas the surface redshift of the star decreases with a decrease in the cosmological constant. The compactness factor and surface redshift corresponding to the maximum mass of the neutron star remains almost constant as\(\Lambda \)decreases.
The observed excesses in the search for neutralinos and charginos by ATLAS and CMS can be fitted simultaneously in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) assuming a light higgsino mass, of magnitude less than about 250 GeV, and acompressedhiggsino dominated neutralino and chargino spectrum, with 5–10% mass splittings. However, light higgsinos as dark matter would have far too large direct detection cross sections. We consider the Next-to-MSSM (NMSSM) with an additional singlino-like lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) a few GeV below the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). Sparticles prefer to decay first into the NLSP and remnants from the final decay into the LSP are too soft to contribute to the observed signals. Co-annihilation in the higgsino-sector can generate a relic density in the WMAP/Planck window. The singlino-like LSP has automatically a direct detection cross section below present and future sensitivities: a direct detection signal in the near future would exclude this scenario. The singlet-like Higgs scalar of the NMSSM can have a mass around 95 GeV and signal cross sections in the\(b\bar{b}\)channel at LEP and in the\(\gamma \gamma \)channel at the LHC compatible with the respective observations.
We study wormhole as the solution of the Wheeler–DeWitt (WdW) equation satisfying Hawking–Page wormhole boundary conditions in Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) cosmology. The quantum wormholes are formulated with arbitrary factor ordering of the Hamiltonian constraint operators with perfect fluid matter sources as well as minimally coupled scalar fields.
The multi-staged XENON program at INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso aims to detect dark matter with two-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers of increasing size and sensitivity. The XENONnT experiment is the latest detector in the program, planned to be an upgrade of its predecessor XENON1T. It features an active target of 5.9 tonnes of cryogenic liquid xenon (8.5 tonnes total mass in cryostat). The experiment is expected to extend the sensitivity to WIMP dark matter by more than an order of magnitude compared to XENON1T, thanks to the larger active mass and the significantly reduced background, improved by novel systems such as a radon removal plant and a neutron veto. This article describes the XENONnT experiment and its sub-systems in detail and reports on the detector performance during the first science run.
The H1 Collaboration reports the first measurement of the 1-jettiness event shape observable\(\tau _1^b\)in neutral-current deep-inelastic electron-proton scattering (DIS). The observable\(\tau _1^b\)is equivalent to a thrust observable defined in the Breit frame. The data sample was collected at the HERAepcollider in the years 2003–2007 with center-of-mass energy of\(\sqrt{s}=319\,\textrm{GeV} \), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 351.1\(\textrm{pb}^{-1}\). Triple differential cross sections are provided as a function of\(\tau _1^b\), event virtuality\(Q^{2}\), and inelasticityy, in the kinematic region\(Q^{2} >150\,\textrm{GeV}^2 \). Single differential cross sections are provided as a function of\(\tau _1^b\)in a limited kinematic range. Double differential cross sections are measured, in contrast, integrated over\(\tau _1^b\)and represent the inclusive neutral-current DIS cross section measured as a function of\(Q^{2}\)andy. The data are compared to a variety of predictions and include long-standing and more recent Monte Carlo event generators, predictions in fixed-order perturbative QCD where calculations up to\(\mathcal {O}(\alpha _\textrm{s} ^3)\)are available for\(\tau _1^b\)or inclusive DIS, and resummed predictions at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy matched to fixed order predictions at\(\mathcal {O}(\alpha _\textrm{s} ^2)\). These comparisons reveal sensitivity of the 1-jettiness observable to QCD parton shower and resummation effects, as well as the modeling of hadronization and fragmentation. Within their range of validity, the fixed-order predictions provide a good description of the data. Monte Carlo event generators are predictive over the full measured range and hence their underlying models and parameters can be constrained by comparing to the presented data.
We discuss the oscillations in the elasticppdifferential cross section seen in the TOTEM data at\(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV on the top of the usual smooth behaviour.
In this second part of our two-series on extracting the Hawking temperature of dynamical black holes, we focus into spacetimes that are conformal transformations of static spacetimes. Our previous investigation builds upon the Unruh–Hawking analogy, which relates the spacetime of a uniformly accelerating observer to the near-horizon region of a black hole, to obtain the Hawking temperature. However, in this work, we explicitly compute the Bogoliubov coefficients associated with incoming and outgoing modes, which not only yields the temperature but also thermal spectrum of particles emitted by a black hole. For illustration, we take the simplest nontrivial example of the linear Vaidya spacetime, which is conformal to the static metric and using this property, we analytically solve the massless scalar field in its background. This allows the explicit computations of the Bogoliubov coefficients to study the particle production in this spacetime. We also derive an expression for the total mass of such dynamical spacetimes using the conformal Killing vector. We then perform differential variations of the mass formula to determine whether the laws of dynamical black hole mechanics correspond to the laws of thermodynamics.
In the realm of natural supersymmetric models, higgsinos are typically the lightest electroweakinos. In gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking models, the lightest higgsino-dominated particles decay into aZ-boson or a Higgs boson (h), along with an ultra-light gravitino (\(\tilde{G}\)) serving as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). This scenario suggests a significant non-resonanthhproduction. Basing on the recent global fitting results of the\(\tilde{G}\)-EWMSSM (MSSM with light electroweakinos and an eV-scale gravitino as the LSP) performed by theGAMBITcollaboration, which support a higgsino-dominated electroweakino as light as 140 GeV, we develop two simplified models to evaluate their detection potential at the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) with\(\sqrt{s} = 14~\textrm{TeV}\)and an integrated luminosity of\(3000~\textrm{fb}^{-1}\). The first model examines the processes where heavier higgsino-dominated states decay into softW/Zbosons, while the second focuses on direct decays of all three higgsino-dominated electroweakinos intoW/Z/hplus a\(\tilde{G}\). Our study, incorporating both models and their distinct decay channels, utilizes detailed Monte Carlo simulations for signals and standard model backgrounds. We find that the HL-LHC can probe higgsinos up to 575 GeV, potentially discovering or excluding the natural SUSY scenario in the context of a gravitino LSP. Further, we reinterpret this discovery potential using the GAMBIT global fit samples, and find that the entire parameter space of\(|\mu | \le 500~\textrm{GeV}\)with an electroweak fine-tuning measure (\(\Delta _{\textrm{EW}}\)) under 100 in\(\tilde{G}\)-EWMSSM is accessible at the HL-LHC.
The\(H_{0}\)tension problem is studied in the light of a matter creation mechanism (an effective approach to replacing dark energy), the way to define the matter creation rate being of pure phenomenological nature. Bayesian (probabilistic) Machine Learning is used to learn the constraints on the free parameters of the models, with the learning being based on the generated expansion rate,H(z). Taking advantage of the method, the constraints for three redshift ranges are learned. Namely, for the two redshift ranges:\(z\in [0,2]\)(cosmic chronometers) and\(z\in [0,2.5]\)(cosmic chronometers + BAO), covering already availableH(z) data, to validate the learned results; and for a third redshift interval,\(z\in [0,5]\), for forecasting purposes. It is learned that the\(3\alpha H_{0}\)term in the creation rate provides options that have the potential to solve the\(H_{0}\)tension problem.
The Kerr/CFT correspondence has been established to explore the quantum theory of gravity in the near-horizon geometry of an extreme Kerr black holes. The quantum gravitational corrections on the near-horizon region may manifest in form of a partially reflective membrane that replace the horizon. In such modification, the black holes now can be seen as a horizonless exotic compact object (ECO). In this paper, we consider the properties of Kerr-like ECOs in near-extremal condition using Kerr/CFT correspondence. We study the quasinormal modes and absorption cross-section in that background and compare these by using CFT dual computation. The corresponding dual CFT one needs to incorporate finite size/finiteNeffects in the dual CFT terminology. We also extend the dual CFT analysis for higher spin perturbations such as photon and graviton. We find consistency between properties of the ECOs from gravity sides and from CFT sides. The quasinormal mode spectrum is in line with non-extreme case, where the differences are in the length of the circle, on which the dual CFT lives, and phase shift of the incoming perturbation. The absorption cross-section has oscillatory feature that start to disappear near extremal limit. The particle spin determines the phase shift and conformal weight. We also obtain that the echo time-delay depends on the position of the membrane and extremality of the ECOs.
The most massive black holes in our Universe form binaries at the centre of merging galaxies. The recent evidence for a gravitational-wave (GW) background from pulsar timing may constitute the first observation that these supermassive black-hole binaries (SMBHBs) merge. Yet, the most massive SMBHBs are out of reach of interferometric GW detectors and are exceedingly difficult to resolve individually with pulsar timing. These limitations call for unexplored strategies to detect individual SMBHBs in the uncharted frequency band ≲10−5Hz to establish their abundance and decipher the coevolution with their host galaxies. Here we show that SMBHBs imprint detectable long-term modulations on GWs from stellar-mass binaries residing in the same galaxy at a distanced≲ 1 kpc. We determine that proposed decihertz GW interferometers sensitive to numerous stellar-mass binaries could uncover modulations from ~O(10−1–104) SMBHBs with masses ~O(107–108) M⊙out to redshiftz≈ 3.5. This offers a unique opportunity to map the population of SMBHBs through cosmic time, which might remain inaccessible otherwise.
Consideration of extra spatial dimensions is motivated by the unification of gravity with other interactions, the achievement of the ultimate framework of quantum gravity, and fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. Much attention has been focused on the effect of these extra dimensions on the modified theories of gravity. Analytically examining astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is one approach to understand how extra dimensions would affect the modified gravitational theories. The purpose of this study is to derive a higher-dimensional metric for a dark compact object in STVG theory and then examine the behaviour of the shadow shapes for this solution in STVG theory in higher dimensions. We apply the Carter method to formulate the geodesic equations and the Hamilton–Jacobi method to find photon orbits around this higher-dimensional MOG dark compact object. We investigate the effects of extra dimensions and the STVG parameter\(\alpha \)on the black hole’s shadow size. Next, we compare the shadow radius of this higher-dimensional MOG dark compact object to the shadow size of the supermassive black hole M87*, which has been realized by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaborations, in order to restrict these parameters. We find that extra dimensions in the STVG theory typically lead to a reduction in the shadow size of the higher-dimensional MOG dark compact object, whereas the effect of parameter\(\alpha \)on this black hole’s shadow is suppressible. Remarkably, given the constraints from EHT observations, we find that the shadow size of the four-dimensional MOG dark compact object lies in the confidence levels of the EHT data. Finally, we investigate the issue of acceleration bounds in higher-dimensional MOG dark compact object in confrontation with EHT data of M87*.

A study of the anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson to vector bosons, including\({\textit{CP}}\)-violation effects, has been conducted using its production and decay in the WW channel. This analysis is performed on proton–proton collision data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC during 2016–2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 138\(\,\text {fb}^{-1}\). The different-flavor dilepton\(({\textrm{e}} {{\upmu }})\)final state is analyzed, with dedicated categories targeting gluon fusion, electroweak vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or Z boson. Kinematic information from associated jets is combined using matrix element techniques to increase the sensitivity to anomalous effects at the production vertex. A simultaneous measurement of four Higgs boson couplings to electroweak vector bosons is performed in the framework of a standard model effective field theory. All measurements are consistent with the expectations for the standard model Higgs boson and constraints are set on the fractional contribution of the anomalous couplings to the Higgs boson production cross section.
This research article examines the impact of\(f({\mathcal {Q}},{\mathcal {T}})\)theory on the geometry of charged neutron stars filled with anisotropic matter configuration. Here,\({\mathcal {Q}}\)represents non-metricity and\({\mathcal {T}}\)denotes the trace of energy-momentum tensor. We use a particular functional form of this modified theory to reduce the system’s complexity and derive explicit relations of the energy density and pressure components. Further, we consider viable non-singular solutions to analyze the internal structure of the charged neutron stars. The unspecified parameters in the metric coefficients are evaluated through Darmois junction conditions, which ensures consistency between interior and exterior solutions of the stellar objects. These parameters are then used to explore different physical characteristics such as the behavior of energy density, pressure components, anisotropy, energy bounds, equation of state parameter, compactness and redshift function in the interior of charged neutron stars. The stability and equilibrium states of the charged stellar objects are discussed using the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation and the speed of sound, respectively. Our results suggest that the charged neutron stars are viable and stable in the presence of dark source terms.
We present a benchmark comparison of the massless inclusive deep-inelastic-scattering (DIS) structure functions up to\(\mathcal {O}(\alpha _s ^3)\)in perturbative QCD. The comparison is performed using the codesapfel++ andhoppetwithin the framework of the variable-flavour-number scheme and over a broad kinematic range relevant to the extraction of parton distribution functions. We provide results for both the single structure functions and the reduced cross sections in both neutral- and charged-current DIS. Look-up tables for future reference are included, and we also release the code used for the benchmark.
Many analyses in particle and nuclear physics use simulations to infer fundamental, effective, or phenomenological parameters of the underlying physics models. When the inference is performed with unfolded cross sections, the observables are designed using physics intuition and heuristics. We propose to design targeted observables with machine learning. Unfolded, differential cross sections in a neural network output contain the most information about parameters of interest and can be well-measured by construction. The networks are trained using a custom loss function that rewards outputs that are sensitive to the parameter(s) of interest while simultaneously penalizing outputs that are different between particle-level and detector-level (to minimize detector distortions). We demonstrate this idea in simulation using two physics models for inclusive measurements in deep inelastic scattering. We find that the new approach is more sensitive than classical observables at distinguishing the two models and also has a reduced unfolding uncertainty due to the reduced detector distortions.
In this paper, we present a cosmological model within the framework of symmetric teleparallel gravity, focusing onf(Q) gravity, whereQrepresents the non-metricity scalar. Utilizing cosmological datasets, we derive an accelerating cosmological model by constraining its free parameters. To achieve this, we determine the parametric form of the Hubble parameter using a well-motivatedf(Q) function. Remarkably, all obtained values fall within the range suggested by cosmological observations. By employing the best-fit parameters, we calculate the present geometrical parameters and demonstrate the accelerating behaviour of the Universe. Furthermore, we thoroughly examine the evolutionary behaviours of the Universe, noting that our model converges to the\(\Lambda \)CDM model at late times. Finally, we investigate the energy conditions and find a violation of the strong energy condition, which could provide a valuable understanding of the nature of dark energy.
The unfolding of detector effects is a key aspect of comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions. In recent years, different Machine-Learning methods have been developed to provide novel features, e.g. high dimensionality or a probabilistic single-event unfolding based on generative neural networks. Traditionally, many analyses unfold detector effects using transfer-matrix-based algorithms, which are well established in low-dimensional unfolding. They yield an unfolded distribution of the total spectrum, together with its covariance matrix. This paper proposes a method to obtain probabilistic single-event unfolded distributions, together with their uncertainties and correlations, for the transfer-matrix-based unfolding. The algorithm is first validated on a toy model and then applied to pseudo-data for the\(pp\rightarrow Z\gamma \gamma \)process. In both examples the performance is compared to the Machine-Learning-based single-event unfolding using an iterative approach with conditional invertible neural networks (IcINN).
We investigate vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor for a massive Dirac field in flat spacetime with a toroidal subspace of a general dimension. Quasiperiodicity conditions with arbitrary phases are imposed on the field operator along compact dimensions. These phases are interpreted in terms of magnetic fluxes enclosed by compact dimensions. The equation of state in the uncompact subspace is of the cosmological constant type. It is shown that, in addition to the diagonal components, the vacuum energy-momentum tensor has nonzero off-diagonal components. In special cases of twisted (antiperiodic) and untwisted (periodic) fields the off diagonal components vanish. For untwisted fields the vacuum energy density is positive and the energy-momentum tensor obeys the strong energy condition. For general values of the phases in the periodicity conditions the energy density and stresses can be either positive or negative. The numerical results are given for a Kaluza-Klein type model with two extra dimensions.
We explore Noether symmetries of Horndeski gravity, extending the classification of general scalar–tensor theories. Starting from the minimally coupled scalar field and the first-generation scalar–tensor gravity, the discussion is generalised to kinetic gravity braiding and Horndeski gravity. We highlight the main findings by focusing on the non-minimally coupled Gauss–Bonnet term and the extended cuscuton model. Finally, we discuss how the presence of matter can influence Noether symmetries. It turns out that the selected Horndeski functions are unchanged with respect to the vacuum case.
The optical appearance of the numerically black hole solutions within the higher derivative gravity illuminated by an accretion disk context is discussed. We obtain solutions for non-Schwarzschild black holes with\(r_0=1\),\(r_0=2\), and\(r_0=3\). Further analysis of spacetime trajectories reveals properties similar to Schwarzschild black holes, while the\(r_0=2\)black hole exhibits significant differences. The results reveal the presence of a repulsive potential barrier for the black hole, allowing only particles with energies exceeding a certain threshold to approach it, providing a unique gravitational scenario for non-Schwarzschild black holes. Additionally, the optical images are derived through numerical simulations by discussing the trajectories of photons in the black hole spacetime. The distribution of radiation flux and the effects of gravitational redshift and Doppler shift on the observed radiation flux are considered. Interestingly, previous analyses of the optical appearance of black holes were conducted within the framework of analytic solutions, whereas the analysis of numerical black hole solutions first appears in our analysis.
To shed light on the nature of the controversial and not yet fully understood exotic states, we are carrying out a systematic study of their electromagnetic properties. The magnetic moment of a hadron state is as fundamental a dynamical quantity as its mass and contains valuable information on the deep underlying structure. In this study, we use the QCD light-cone sum rule to extract the magnetic moments of the\(\mathrm {P_{c}(4312)}\),\(\mathrm {P_{c}(4380)}\), and\(\mathrm {P_{c}(4440)}\)pentaquarks by considering them as the molecular picture with spin-parity\(\mathrm {J^P= \frac{1}{2}^-}\),\(\mathrm {J^P= \frac{3}{2}^-}\), and\(\mathrm {J^P= \frac{3}{2}^-}\), respectively. We define the isospin of the interpolating currents of these states, which is the key to solving the puzzle of the hidden-charm pentaquark states, to make these analyses more precise and reliable. We have compared our results with other theoretical predictions that could be a useful complementary tool for the interpretation of the hidden-charm pentaquark sector, and we observe that they are not in mutual agreement with each other. We have also calculated higher multipole moments for spin-3/2\(\bar{D}^{*} \Sigma _c\)and\(\bar{D} \Sigma _c^{*}\)pentaquarks, indicating a non-spherical charge distribution.
In this work, we study several extensions of the higher curvature modification of\(R^{2}\)inflation in the context of gravity’s rainbow. We modify the\((R+R^{2})\)model by adding an\(f_{1}R^3\)-term, an\(f_{2}R^4\)-term, and an\(f_{3}R^{3/2}\)-term to the original model. We calculate the inflationary observables and confront them using the latest observational bounds from Planck 2018 data. We assume the rainbow function of the form\({\tilde{f}}=1+\left( \frac{H}{M}\right) ^{\lambda }\)with\(\lambda \)being a rainbow parameter andMa mass-dimensional parameter. We demonstrate that the power spectrum of curvature perturbation relies on the dimensionless coefficient\(f_{i},\,i=1,2,3\), a rainbow parameter\(\lambda \)and a ratioH/M. Likewise, the scalar spectral index\(n_s\)is affected by both\(f_{i}\)and the rainbow parameter. Moreover, the tensor-to-scalar ratioris solely determined by the rainbow parameter. Interestingly, by ensuring that\(n_s\)aligns with the Planck collaboration’s findings at the\(1\sigma \)confidence level, the tensor-to-scalar ratio could reach up to\(r\sim 0.01\), which is possibly measurable for detection in forthcoming Stage IV CMB ground experiments and is certainly feasible for future dedicated space missions.
AbstractSemianalytical pancake models published in the literature are considered, in which it is assumed that a low-strength, fragmented body, like a liquid, expands during flight in the atmosphere and, while maintaining a certain simple shape and increasing the cross-sectional area, decelerates at much higher altitudes than a strong body. Individual models differ in the rate of increase in the transverse size of the body. For comparison with the models, hydrodynamic simulations of falls of liquid bodies with a diameter of 40 m in the Earth’s atmosphere were carried out without taking into account ablation. Such bodies, before they begin to slow down significantly, break up into fragments. Unlike simple models, while the body remains coherent, it can take on very distorted shapes. Comparison of pancake models with the results of hydrodynamic modeling allows us to determine the most suitable models for assessing the behavior of asteroids in the atmosphere and evaluate the assumptions embedded in them. In hydrodynamic modeling taking into account ablation, as shown by the results published in other works, complete evaporation of the body can first occur and, only then, the braking of the vapor jet. In pancake models, complete evaporation means the disappearance of mass and a complete stop of motion. The theoretical basis of these models needs to be revised.
AbstractThe article presents the results of the analysis of data from the Russian neutron spectrometer LEND (Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector), installed aboard NASA’s lunar orbiter LRO (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter). An estimate of the content of subsurface water ice in the permanently shadowed region Cabeus-1, located inside the large Cabeus crater in the vicinity of the lunar south pole, has been obtained. The analysis used observations made with the LEND instrument from 2009 to 2023. It is shown that the surface neutron albedo in the vicinity and inside of Cabeus-1 correlates with the relief height and the distribution of average annual temperatures. The average subsurface water ice content over the entire Cabeus-1 region was estimated to be 0.49 ± 0.05% by mass fraction. The maximum value of about 0.7% is observed at the very bottom of the crater on the surface area where the minimum average annual temperature was recorded. This site coincides with the site of the LCROSS (Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite) impact experiment, which confirmed a significant amount of water ice in the near-surface material of the Moon.
AbstractThe Chandler wobble of Venus has been analyzed on the basis of the Earth-like models of the planet. The method for calculating the Chandler wobble period of Venus was tested on the example of the Earth. To take into account the inelasticity of the interior of a planet, the Andrade rheology was used; and the values of the rheologic model parameters, which can explain the observed period of the Chandler wobble of the Earth, were determined. Projections on the Chandler wobble period of Venus were obtained. For the most plausible models of the internal structure of Venus, in which the core radius is assumed to be within an interval of 3288 ± 167 km, the Chandler wobble period is 30–48 thousand years. A large error in the results is mainly caused by a wide range of probable values for the constant of precession of Venus.
AbstractIn order to estimate the age, the work examined the probabilistic evolution of three young pairs of asteroids in close orbits: (87 887) 2000 SS286—(415 992) 2002 AT49, (320 025) 2007 DT76—(489 464) 2007 DP16, (21 436) Chaoyichi—(334 916) 2003 YK39. In the numerical simulation, along with gravitational disturbances, the Yarkovsky effect in the form of a secular drift of the orbital semimajor axis was taken into account. For each pair of asteroids, 25 evolution scenarios were considered, corresponding to different combinations of obliquities of the asteroids’ rotation axes and, correspondingly, different drift rates of the semimajor axes due to the Yarkovsky effect. For each asteroid, 1000 clones were generated. Age estimates were obtained based on analysis of moment distributions: (1) low relative-velocity close encounters of asteroids of pair to distances on the order of the Hill sphere at a relative speed of several units of the escape velocity and (2) achievement of minimum values of the Kholshevnikov metric, which characterizes the distance between orbits.The following age estimates for young asteroid pairs were obtained: (87 887) 2000 SS286 and (415 992) 2002 AT49 from 7.58 ± 0.04 to 8.80 ± 0.04 kyr; (320 025) 2007 DT76 and (489464) 2007 DP16 from 15.5 ± 1.0 to 58.6 ± 16.0 kyr; (21 436) Chaoyichi and (334 916) 2003 YK39 from 32.3 ± 0.1 to 102.6 ± 0.7 kyr.
A connection is established between transonic sound waves propagating along a de Laval nozzle and quasinormal modes emitted from hairy black holes obtained with the gravitational decoupling method applied to the Reissner–Nordström geometry. Aerodynamical features provide an analogue setup to test experimentally perturbations of fluid flows in a de Laval nozzle producing quasinormal modes. In particular, nozzle shape, pressure, Mach number, temperature, density, and thrust coefficient profiles are determined as functions of the black hole parameters for several multipole numbers. The black hole quasinormal mode frequencies are also investigated for different overtones, evaluating the quality factor of the nozzle.
AbstractThe results of numerical modeling of the values of the Chandler wobble period of Mars have been presented for a set of internal structure models that satisfy all currently available observable data: geodetic (average radius, mass, moment of inertia, tidal Love numberk2) and crustal thickness and core radius values obtained from seismic data processing. Andrade rheology was used to take into account inelasticity when calculating model values of the tidal Love numberk2and the Chandler wobble period. It has been shown how the model values of the Love numberk2and the Chandler period depend on the Andrade rheological parameter and the adopted viscosity distribution.
AbstractBased on the PREM Earth model, more than a thousand models of the internal structure of Venus have been built, differing in the radius and density of the core, the density of the mantle, the viscosity distribution and rheology. The core radius varies from 2800 to 3600 km, and the density in the mantle and core varies within a few percent of the PREM model values. When calculating tidal Love numbers, Andrade rheology is used to take into account the inelasticity of the mantle. Specifically the values of the Andrade rheological model parameters that best describe the tidal deformation of the Earth are used. This significantly reduces the error when calculating Love numbers. It has been shown that Venus can have an internal solid core only if the composition of the planet is very different from that of Earth. Comparison of the observed values of the moment of inertia and tidal Love numberk2with model values allowed us to conclude that the radius of the core of Venus is with a high probability in the range of 3288 ± 167 km.
We are systematically studying the electromagnetic characteristics of multiquark systems to shed light on their internal structure, whose nature and quantum numbers are controversial. In this study, we investigate the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the\(\Xi _c^*{\bar{K}}\)state within the context of the QCD light-cone sum rule. During this analysis, we posit that the\(\Xi _c^*{\bar{K}}\)state assumes a molecular structure with quantum numbers\(J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-\). The extracted outcomes are given as\(\mu _{\Xi _c^*{\bar{K}}} = 0.15^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\,\mu _N\),\({\mathcal {Q}}_{\Xi _c^*{\bar{K}}} = (-0.93^{+0.22}_{-0.17})\times 10^{-3}\,\textrm{fm}^{\textrm{2}}\), and\({\mathcal {O}}_{\Xi _c^*{\bar{K}}} = (-0.45^{+0.10}_{-0.09})\times 10^{-4}\,{\textrm{fm}}^{\textrm{3}}\). The findings of this study, when considered alongside other pertinent characteristics, may assist in elucidating the nature of this controversial phenomenon.
We extend our previous study of the interactions of\(\bar{D}^{(*)} \Lambda _c - \bar{D}^{(*)}\Sigma _c^{(*)}\)within an analytic, unitary, coupled-channel approach by including the\(J/\psi p\)channel and performing fits to the\(J/\psi p\)invariant mass distributions in the\(\Lambda _b^0 \rightarrow J/\psi p K^-\)decay by the LHCb Collaboration. We take into account the contributions oft-channel pseudoscalar and vector meson exchanges andu-channel baryon exchanges in this work, and a series of bound states and resonances with different spin-parities are dynamically generated. According to the results, four states have a significant impact on the physical observables, with two having a spin-parity of\(1/2^-\)and the other two having\(3/2^-\). These states can be associated with the LHCb hidden-charm pentaquarks. We further provide the coupling strength between each pole and different channels, which provides some insights on how to search for them in future experiments. Moreover, we also search for poles in higher partial waves up to\(J=7/2\)and find indications for the existence of several states with larger widths.
Results are presented from an analysis of manifestations of the activity of the spectral class K2V dwarf HD189733, which has one of the best studied exoplanets of the hot-Jupiter type. Including the activity of the star makes analysis of the characteristics of the planet considerably more complicated (in particular, cool spots on the star’s surface introduce an additional signal in the relation between the depth of a transit and the size of the planet and prevent an exact determination of the radius of the planet). Photometric data for HD189733 in the archive of the TESS mission are analyzed and conclusions are reached on the values of the rotation period Protof the star, for which we estimated values of 12.5 and 11.3 days for sectors 41 and 54, respectively. A comparison of these with previous estimates based on earthbound photometric observations suggests that the differences in Protat different times are related to the fact of different observation times spots located at different latitudes on the surface of the differentially rotating star predominated. According to the TESS data the amplitude of the brightness variation of HD189733 is 1.6 and 0.9% of the mean brightness level of the star (for sectors 41 and 54, respectively). The standard method was used to estimate the spottedness parameter of the star (2.0 and 1.2% of the star’s surface area) and values of the area of the spotted surface A of the star in absolute terms (9200 MSH and 5400 MSH for sectors 41 and 54, respectively) were obtained. Based on 771 estimates of the star’s brightness in the V band presented in the Kamogata Wide-field Survey, an analysis was made of the long-term activity of HD189733 which yielded indications of the possible existence of activity cycles of duration 1140 and 4220 days (3.1 and 11.6 years, respectively). Based on an analysis of published data it has been concluded that the level of chromospheric activity of HD189733 exceeds the average values typical of other cool dwarfs with analogous values of the color index (B-V) and is higher than the solar value. It is concluded that HD189733 has a moderate (or somewhat higher than average) activity typical of analogous dwarfs in spectral class K but, nevertheless, requires that the properties and evolution of the planet formed around this star be taken into detailed account during modeling, regardless of whether a simplified method or an exact magnetohydrodynamic model is used to estimate them. It should also be noted that the activity of the star is a variable over time (on a time scale comparable to Prot) and requires estimates that are made simultaneously with the main studies of the exoplanet’s atmosphere.
We have carried out a spectral classification by the Activity Types for a subsample of Blazars from the BZCAT v.5 Catalogue, namely the BL Lac (BLL, Lacertids) candidates, designated in the Catalogue as BZB subtype objects. The classification is based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) homogeneous medium-resolution optical spectroscopy and along with the standard BPT-type diagnostic diagrams, we have applied our newly introduced fine classification scheme with subtypes of Quasars and considering many more features. Out of 1151 BZB objects, 552 having SDSS spectra were classified. After new classification, 259 (46.1%) of 552 have not changed their optical class, and 293 (53.1%) of these objects have changed their optical class. Having this new information on the optical classification we suggest to change the classification of some objects in BZCAT: for 130 BZB objects to BZG, for 18 BZB objects to BZQ and for 145 BZB objects to BZU.
In this paper, we have used the Plane Symmetric LRS Bianchi type I metric to study bulk viscous fluid coupled to a string of clouds within the framework of thef(R) theory of gravity. To obtain the deterministic solutions, some physically plausible conditions like the weak field limit for a point-like sourcef(R) =R3/2, the very well known expansion-shear scalar proportionality relation and the special form of an average scale factor are taken into account. Furthermore, we have calculated some physical and kinematical parameters along with the energy conditions to study the astrophysical implications of the constructed model and discussed their graphical behaviour, which shows good similarity with recent observational data.
The properties of isospin-asymmetric cold nuclear matter are studied in terms of the relativistic mean-field theory in which, besides the fields of σ, ω, and ρ mesons, and the isovector, Lorentz-scalar field of the δ-meson is also taken into account. The properties of purely nucleonicnpmatter are studied as a function of the baryon densitynBand the asymmetry parameter α, as well as the properties of electrically neutral β-equilibriumnpeμ matter as a function of the baryon densitynB.For different values ofnBand a, such characteristics ofnpmatter as the energy per baryon, the specific energy owing to isospin asymmetry, the effective proton and neutron masses, and the specific binding energy, are determined. It is shown that the energy owing to the asymmetry for a fixed value of α is a monotonically increasing function of the baryon densitynB. Fornpem matter, the effective proton and neutron masses\({M}_{p}^{\left(eff\right)},{M}_{n}^{\left(eff\right)},\)the specific binding energyEbind, the symmetry energyEsym, the quantitative fraction of protonsYp=np/nBare studied, as well as the average meson fields\(\widetilde{\upsigma },\widetilde{\upomega },\widetilde{\updelta },\)and\(\widetilde{\uprho }\)as functions of the baryon densitynB.
This paper is an analysis of data from multicolor photometric observations of the asynchronous polar IGR J19552+0044 obtained over 59 nights from 2019-2022 at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, as well as at the Terskol Peak, Sanglokh, and Lesniki Observatories, and data from the TESS space telescope obtained on 27 days in 2022. It is shown that the maximum amplitude of the brightness oscillations at the rotation period of the white dwarf (~2m.5-3m) is observed in the Ic band and is essentially close to zero in the B band. The rotation period of the white dwarf is refined to 0.05645350(14) days. A dependence of the amplitude of the brightness curve of the rotation period on the phase of the synodic period is detected.
This paper presents the reconstruction of the quintessence dark energy potential in a model- independent way. Reconstruction relies on a Gaussian process and on available expansion rate data. Specifically, 40-point values of H(z) are used, consisting of a 30-point sample deduced from a differential age method and an additional 10-point sample obtained from the radial BAO method. Results are obtained for two kernel functions and for three different values of H0. This sheds light on the H0tension problem indicating that it is not just a numerical problem. The model-independent reconstruction of the potential can serve as a reference to constraint available models and construct new ones. Various possibilities, including V(ϕ) ~ e-λϕ, are compared with the reconstructions here obtained, which is notably the first truly model-independent reconstruction of the quintessence dark energy potential. This allows the selection of new models that can be interesting for cosmology. The method can be extended to reconstruct the potential of related dark energy models, to be considered in future work.
In this paper, we have revisited the Berman’s idea of the variation of Hubble parameter. While previously explored in the context of Λ-varying cosmologies, where scale factor variations yield linear universe expansion, this parametrization has undergone extensive scrutiny. Our investigation, however, explores into its implications in the context of late-time cosmic acceleration, within the framework of classical general relativity, adopting the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime as our background metric. Our analysis offers a precise solution to Einstein’s field equations (EFEs) in a model-independent way, affording a thorough assessment of both geometrical and physical model parameters. Additionally, this study supplements its findings with graphical representations of the evolving cosmological parameters across flat, closed, and open universe scenarios, all subject to constraints derived from the model parameters. In synthesizing these results, we shed light on the intricate interplay between cosmic acceleration, dark energy, and the parametrization of the Hubble parameter, thereby providing valuable insights into the fundamental mechanics of our universe.
Photometric data were used to perform the first light curve analysis of the V0610 Vir binary system. Observations and analysis were done in the form of the Binary Systems of South and North (BSN) Project. We extracted the minima from our observations and compiled the literature, which was few. Therefore, we performed computations using the reference ephemeris and presented a new ephemeris and O-C diagram with a linear fit. Light curve analysis was performed using the PHOEBE Python code and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The assumption of a hot starspot was required due to the asymmetry in the light curve’s maxima. The analysis shows that V0610 Vir is a contact binary system with a fillout factor of 0.085, a mass ratio of 0.998, and an inclination of 70°.65. The absolute parameters of the system were estimated based on the Gaia DR3 parallax method. The results show that the system is a low-mass contact binary with a total mass lower than 0.8 M⨀. The location of the stars was shown in the M - L and M - R diagrams.
The Vlasov equations are used to determine the transverse and longitudinal dielectric permeabilities of a hot, rarefied ultrarelativistic electron-positron plasma. The Fermi distribution is used as the unperturbed distribution function of the electrons and positrons. It is shown that, owing to the abundant production of electron-positron pairs, the plasma frequency of the ultrarelativistic plasma increases linearly with rising temperature. Here the ratio of the frequency at which the spectral density of the equilibrium emission is maximal to the plasma frequency remains fixed and equals 28. It is shown that in this sort of plasma, in particular in the matter of the early universe in the ultrarelativistic electronpositron epoch, the spectrum of the radiation differs very little from black-body radiation.
A method is presented to reconstruct charged particles with lifetimes between\(10\,\text {ps} \)and\(10\,\text {ns},\)which considers a combination of their decay products and the partial tracks created by the initial charged particle. Using the\({\varXi } ^- \)baryon as a benchmark, the method is demonstrated with simulated events and proton-proton collision data at\(\sqrt{s} =13\,\text {TeV},\)corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.0\(\,\text {fb} ^{-1}\)collected with the LHCb detector in 2018. Significant improvements in the angular resolution and the signal purity are obtained. The method is implemented as part of the LHCb Run 3 event trigger in a set of requirements to select detached hyperons. This is the first demonstration of the applicability of this approach at the LHC, and the first to show its scaling with instantaneous luminosity.
We compute top quark pair production in association with a bottom quark pair at the LHC within the five-flavour scheme, matched to a parton shower, employing the FxFx merging scheme for\(t\bar{t}+\text {jets}\)production with up to 2 jets at NLO accuracy. To enhance the selection efficiency for the events withb-jets within the inclusive five-flavour sample, we augment the generation probability of bottom quark flavours in the short-distance event generation. Our analysis reveals some differences from NLO predictions within the four-flavour scheme.
Correlation functions are ubiquitous tools in quantum field theory from both a fundamental and a practical point of view. However, up to now their use in theories of quantum gravity beyond perturbative and asymptotically flat regimes has been limited, due to difficulties associated with diffeomorphism invariance and the dynamical nature of geometry. We present an analysis of a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant, nonperturbative two-point curvature correlator in two-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity. It is based on the recently introduced quantum Ricci curvature and uses a lattice regularization of the full path integral in terms of causal dynamical triangulations. We discuss some of the subtleties and ambiguities in defining connected correlators in theories of dynamical geometry, and provide strong evidence from Monte Carlo simulations that the connected two-point curvature correlator in 2D Lorentzian quantum gravity vanishes. This work paves the way for an analogous investigation in higher dimensions.
In this work, the spectra of the prospective exotic hidden-charm and hidden-bottom baryonium, viz. the baryon–antibaryon states, with\(J^{PC}=0^{--}\)and\(0^{+-}\)are investigated in the framework of QCD sum rules. The non-perturbative contributions up to dimension 12 are taken into account. Numerical results indicate that there might exist 3 possible\(0^{--}\)hidden-charm baryonium states with masses\((5.22\pm 0.26)\),\((5.52\pm 0.25)\), and\((5.46\pm 0.24)\)GeV, and 5 possible\(0^{+-}\)hidden-charm baryonium states with masses\((4.76\pm 0.28)\),\((5.24\pm 0.28)\),\((5.16\pm 0.27)\),\((5.52\pm 0.27)\), and\((5.69\pm 0.27)\)GeV, respectively. The corresponding hidden-bottom partners are found lying in the range of\(11.68-12.28\)GeV and\(11.38-12.33\)GeV, respectively. The possible baryonium decay modes are analyzed, which are hopefully measurable in LHC experiments.
In this work, we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to study the behavior of a triply heavy baryon within anisotropic backgrounds. Beginning with the total action of the three quarks, we derive the balance equation for the three-quark system and compute the separation distance and potential energy. Our results reveal a consistent decrease in both the separation distance and potential energy for the A configuration and the B configuration as the anisotropy coefficientaincreases. This suggests that the presence of an anisotropic background promotes the dissolution of the three-quark system. Additionally, we compare the potential energies of the A and B configurations and observe that the A configuration has a slightly smaller potential energy, suggesting greater stability compared to the B configuration.
Organic macromolecular matter is the dominant carrier of volatile elements such as carbon, nitrogen and noble gases in chondrites—the rocky building blocks from which Earth formed. How this macromolecular substance formed in space is unclear. Here we show that its formation could be associated with the presence of dust traps, which are prominent mechanisms for forming planetesimals in planet-forming disks. We demonstrate the existence of heavily irradiated zones in dust traps, where small frozen molecules that coat large quantities of microscopic dust grains could be rapidly converted into macromolecular matter by receiving radiation doses of up to several tens of electronvolts per molecule per year. This allows for the transformation of simple molecules into complex macromolecular matter within several decades. Up to roughly 4% of the total disk ice reservoir can be processed this way and subsequently incorporated into the protoplanetary disk midplane where planetesimals form. This finding shows that planetesimal formation and the production of organic macromolecular matter, which provides the essential elemental building blocks for life, might be linked.
A search is presented for flavour-changing neutral-current interactions involving the top quark, the Higgs boson and an up-type quark (\(q=u,c\)) with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis considers leptonic decays of the top quark along with Higgs boson decays into two\(W\)bosons, two\(Z\)bosons or a\(\tau ^{+}\tau ^{-}\)pair. It focuses on final states containing either two leptons (electrons or muons) of the same charge or three leptons. The considered processes are\(t\bar{t}\)andHtproduction. For the\(t\bar{t}\)production, one top quark decays via\(t\rightarrow Hq\). The proton–proton collision data set analysed amounts to\(({140}\,{\hbox {fb}^{-1}})\)at\((\sqrt{s}={13}\,\hbox {TeV})\). No significant excess beyond Standard Model expectations is observed and upper limits are set on the\(t\rightarrow Hq\)branching ratios at 95 % confidence level, amounting to observed (expected) limits of\(\mathcal {B}(t\rightarrow Hu)<2.8\,(3.0) \times 10^{-4}\)and\(\mathcal {B}(t\rightarrow Hc)<3.3\,(3.8) \times 10^{-4}\). Combining this search with other searches for\(tHq\)flavour-changing neutral-current interactions previously conducted by ATLAS, considering\(H\rightarrow b\bar{b}\)and\(H\rightarrow \gamma \gamma \)decays, as well as\(H\rightarrow \tau ^{+}\tau ^{-}\)decays with one or two hadronically decaying\(\tau \)-leptons, yields observed (expected) upper limits on the branching ratios of\(\mathcal {B}(t\rightarrow Hu)<2.6\,(1.8) \times 10^{-4}\)and\(\mathcal {B}(t\rightarrow Hc)<3.4\,(2.3) \times 10^{-4}\).
We describe pentaquarks as ‘baryo-charmonia’ with a color octet\(c{\bar{c}}\)core bonded to a color octet three-quark system. Fermi statistics of the light quark cloud allows to describe two pentaquark triplets: a lower one, well supported by experiment, and a higher one with strangeness. For the time being, the lowest line of the strange triplet has been experimentally identified in a\(3\sigma \)peak. Data also suggest two different production mechanisms for pentaquarks. We show how this can be described in the proposed scheme.
The butterfly velocity of four-dimensional rotating charged asymptotically AdS black hole is calculated to probe chaos using localized rotating shock waves. In this work, we obtain the angular momentum dependence of the butterfly velocity due to rotation in the shock wave probes. In general, the angular momentum\(\mathcal {L}\)of the shock waves increases the butterfly velocity. The localized shocks also generate butterfly velocities which vanish when we approach extremality, indicating no entanglement spread near extremality. One of the butterfly velocity modes is well bounded by both the speed of light and the Schwarzschild-AdS result, while the other may become superluminal. Aside from the logarithmic behavior of the scrambling time which indicates chaos, the Lyapunov exponent is also positive and bounded by\(\kappa =2\pi T_H/(1-\mu \mathcal {L})\). The Kerr–NUT–AdS and Kerr–Sen–AdS solutions and their ultraspinning versions are used as examples to attain a better understanding of the chaotic phenomena in rotating black holes, especially those with extra conserved charges.
We construct the generalized\(\beta \)and (q,t)-deformed partition functions throughWrepresentations, where the expansions are respectively with respect to the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials labeled byN-tuple of Young diagrams. We find that there are the profound interrelations between our deformed partition functions and the 4dand 5dNekrasov partition functions. Since the corresponding Nekrasov partition functions can be given by vertex operators, the remarkable connection between our\(\beta \)and (q,t)-deformedW-operators and vertex operators is revealed in this paper. In addition, we investigate the higher Hamiltonians for the generalized Jack and Macdonald polynomials.
Employing extended phase space formalism, we study critical phenomenon of A-charge and C-charge for holographic theories dual to Gauss–Bonnet black holes. We find an universal critical Gauss–Bonnet coupling, giving rise to an universal ratio between the two central charges at the critical point. This leads to a new intepretation for critical behavior of Gauss–Bonnet black holes in terms of the boundary degrees of freedoms, although the solutions are electrically neutral. Another novel feature is for either of the central charges, the transition temperature is beyond the critical point but is upper bounded by causality of the boundary theories.
In this work, we investigate six helicity amplitudes of the four-body\(B_{(s)} \rightarrow (\pi \pi )(K\bar{K})\)decays via an angular analysis in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach. The\(\pi \pi \)invariant mass spectrum is dominated by the vector resonance\(\rho (770)\)together with scalar resonance\(f_0(980)\), while the vector resonance\(\phi (1020)\)and scalar resonance\(f_0(980)\)are expected to contribute in the\(K\bar{K}\)invariant mass range. We extract the two-body branching ratios\(\mathcal{B}(B_{(s)}\rightarrow \rho \phi )\)from the corresponding four-body decays\(B_{(s)}\rightarrow \rho \phi \rightarrow (\pi \pi )(K \bar{K})\)based on the narrow width approximation. The predicted\(\mathcal{B}(B^0_{s}\rightarrow \rho \phi )\)agrees well with the current experimental data within errors. The longitudinal polarization fractions of the\(B_{(s)}\rightarrow \rho \phi \)decays are found to be as large as\(90\%\), basically consistent with the previous two-body predictions within uncertainties. In addition to the directCPasymmetries, the triple-product asymmetries (TPAs) originating from the interference among various helicity amplitudes are also presented for the first time. Since the\(B_s^0\rightarrow \rho ^0\phi \rightarrow (\pi ^+\pi ^-)(K^+K^-)\)decay is induced by both tree and penguin operators, the values of the\(\mathcal{A}^\textrm{CP}_\textrm{dir}\)and\(\mathcal{A}^{1}_{\text {T-true}}\)are calculated to be\((21.8^{+2.7}_{-3.3})\%\)and\((-10.23^{+1.73}_{-1.56})\%\)respectively. While for pure penguin decays\(B^0\rightarrow \rho ^0\phi \rightarrow (\pi ^+\pi ^-)(K^+K^-)\)and\(B^+\rightarrow \rho ^+\phi \rightarrow (\pi ^+\pi ^0)(K^+K^-)\), both the directCPasymmetries and “true” TPAs are naturally expected to be zero in the standard model (SM) due to the absence of the weak phase difference. The “fake” TPAs requiring no weak phase difference are usually none zero for all considered decay channels. The sizable “fake”\(\mathcal{A}^{1}_{\text {T-fake}}=(-20.92^{+6.26}_{-2.80})\%\)of the\(B^0\rightarrow \rho ^0\phi \rightarrow (\pi ^+\pi ^-)(K^+K^-)\)decay is predicted in the PQCD approach, which provides valuable information on the final-state interactions. The above predictions can be tested by the future LHCb and Belle-II experiments.
Based on the fitting results of the LHCb collaboration on the contributions of various intermediate resonances to the\(B^{+}\rightarrow \pi ^{+}\pi ^{+}\pi ^{-}\)decay, we calculate the branching fractions and localizedCPasymmetries of the quasi-two-body\(B^{+}\rightarrow \pi ^{+} \left( \rho (770), \omega (782), \rho (1450), f_{2}\left( 1270\right) \rightarrow \right) \pi ^{+}\pi ^{-}\)decays within the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach systematically. Our theoretical predictions for the branching fractions agree well with the data within the errors. In order to further test the framework of the three-bodyBmeson decays in PQCD and the wave functions of\(\pi \pi \)pair, we also calculate the branching fractions of the corresponding two-body\(B^{+}\rightarrow \pi ^{+}\rho (770)\),\(B^{+}\rightarrow \pi ^{+}\omega (782)\)and\(B^{+}\rightarrow \pi ^{+}f_{2}\left( 1270\right) \)decays under the narrow-width-approximation, which are in consistence with the experimental data. The directCPasymmetries of\(B^{+}\rightarrow \pi ^{+}(\rho (770/1450)\rightarrow ) \pi ^{+}\pi ^{-}\)decays are found to be very small because these decay modes are tree-dominated. However, due to the large penguin contributions from the chiral enhanced annihilation diagrams,\(B^{+}\rightarrow \pi ^{+} (f_{2}\left( 1270\right) \rightarrow )\pi ^{+}\pi ^{-}\)decay has a large directCPasymmetry, which is also discovered by LHCb collaboration. A relatively largeCPasymmetry is also expected in the\(B^+\rightarrow \pi ^+ (\omega \rightarrow )\pi ^+\pi ^-\)decay occurring via\(\rho -\omega \)mixing, which would be measured LHCb and Belle-II experiments in future.
We examine the main properties of gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by transient hyperbolic encounters of black holes. We begin by building the set of basic variables most relevant to setting our problem. After exposing the ranges of masses and eccentricities accessible at a given GW frequency, we analyze the dependence of the gravitational strain on those parameters and determine the trajectories resulting in the most sizeable strains. Some non-trivial behaviors are unveiled, showing that highly eccentric events can be more easily detectable than parabolic ones. In particular, we underline the correct way to extend formulas from hyperbolic to parabolic orbits. Our reasonings are as general as possible, and we make a point of explaining our considerations pedagogically. The majority of the work is based on Newtonian dynamics and aims at being a benchmark to which more accurate calculations can be compared.
We investigate the magnetic excitations of the two-dimensional (2D)S= 1/2 trimerized Heisenberg models with intratrimer interactionJ1and intertrimer interactionJ2on four different lattices using a combination of stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation methods (SAC), complemented by cluster perturbation theory (CPT). These models exhibit quasi-particle-like excitations wheng=J2/J1is weak, characterized by low-energy magnons, intermediate-energy doublons, and high-energy quartons. The low-energy magnons are associated with the magnetic ground states. They can be described by the linear spin wave theory (LSWT) of the effective block spin model and the original spin model. Doublons and quartons emerge from the corresponding internal excitations of the trimers with distinct energy levels, which can be effectively analyzed using perturbative calculation when the ratio of exchange interactionsgis weak. In this weakgregime, we observe a clear separation between the magnon and higher-energy spectra. Asgincreases, doublon and quarton gradually merge into the magnon modes or some continua. Notably, in the Collinear II and trimerized Hexagon lattice, a broad continuum emerges above the single-magnon spectrum, originating from the quasi-1D physics due to the dilute connections between chains. In addition, we also compare our numerical results to the experimental RIXS spectrum and analyze the difference. Our numerical analysis of these 2D trimers yields valuable theoretical predictions and explanations for the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra of 2D magnetic materials featuring trimerized lattices.
We study the bounce cosmology to construct a singularity-free\(f({\mathcal {R}})\)model using the reconstruction technique. The formulation of the\(f({\mathcal {R}})\)model is based on the Raychaudhari equation, a key element employed in reconstructed models to eliminate singularities. We explore the feasibility of obtaining stable gravitational Lagrangians, adhering to the conditions\(f_{{\mathcal {R}}}>0\)and\(f_{{\mathcal {R}}{\mathcal {R}}}>0\). Consequently, both models demonstrate stability, effectively avoiding the Dolgov–Kawasaki instability. Our assessment extends to testing the reconstructed model using energy conditions and the effective equation-of-state (EoS). Our findings indicate that the reconstructed super-bounce model facilitates the examination of a singularity-free accelerating universe for both phantom and non-phantom phases. However, in the case of the reconstructed oscillatory bounce model, two scenarios are considered with\(\omega =-\,1/3\)and\(\omega =-\,2/3\). While the model proves suitable for studying a singular-free accelerating universe in the\(\omega =-\,1/3\)case, it fails to demonstrate such behavior under energy conditions for the\(\omega =-\,2/3\)scenario. The reconstructed models accommodate early-time bouncing behavior and late-time cosmic acceleration within a unified framework.
In the quest for direct dark matter detection, innovative approaches to lower the detection threshold and explore the sub-GeV mass range, have gained high relevance in the last decade. This study presents the pioneering use of Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) as a low-temperature calorimeter for probing dark matter-electron interactions within the DAREDEVIL (DARk-mattEr DEVIces for Low energy detection) project. Our experimental setup features a GaAs crystal at an ultralow temperature of 15 mK, coupled with a Neutron Transmutation Doped Germanium (NTD-Ge) thermal sensor for precise energy estimation. This configuration is the first step towards detecting single electrons scattered by dark matter particles within the GaAs crystal, to improve the sensitivity to low-mass dark matter candidates significantly. Taking advantage of the production of optical phonons in polar materials such as GaAs gives the possibility to study the scattering of sub-MeV dark matter. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the detector’s response, using a calibration spectrum using\(\alpha \)particles and X-ray events. While the results do not meet the ambitious eV scale threshold yet, they establish a solid benchmark for assessing the detector’s current performance and sensitivity. This work not only highlights the detector’s potential but also sets the stage for future enhancements aimed at achieving the eV threshold, underscoring the promising direction of this detector technology. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using GaAs as a cryogenic calorimeter and hence open new avenues for investigating the elusive nature of dark matter through innovative direct detection techniques.
A novel method to treat effects from evanescent operators in next-to-leading order (NLO) computations is introduced. The approach allows, besides further simplifications, to discard evanescent-to-physical mixing contributions in NLO calculations. The method is independent of the treatments of\(\gamma _5\)and can therefore be combined with different renormalization schemes. We illustrate the utility of this result by reproducing literature results of two-loop anomalous dimension matrices for both\(|\Delta F| = 1\)and\(|\Delta F| = 2\)transitions.
We derive a low-temperature expansion of the formula to compute the average annihilation rate\({\langle {\sigma v}\rangle }\)for dark matter in\({\mathbb {Z}}_2\)-symmetric models, both in the absence and the presence of mass degeneracy in the spectrum near the dark matter candidate. We show that the result obtained in the absence of mass degeneracy is compatible with the analytic formulae in the literature, and that it has a better numerical behaviour for low temperatures. We also provide as ancillary files twoWolfram Mathematicanotebooks, which perform the two expansions at any order.
A system of dispersive representations of the Omnès–Khuri–Treiman–Sawyer–Wali type for the final-state interactions in the amplitudes of the\(K\rightarrow \pi \pi \pi \)weak transitions is constructed, under the assumptions that CP and isospin symmetries are conserved. Both the\(\Delta I = 1/2\)and\(\Delta I = 3/2\)transition channels are considered. The set of single-variable functions involved in these representations is identified, and the polynomial ambiguities in their definitions are discussed. Numerical solutions for the system of coupled integral relations satisfied by these functions are provided, and the determination of the subtraction constants in terms of the experimental information on the amplitudes in the decay region is addressed.
One of the main issues in gravitation is the presence of singularities in the most common space-time solutions of General Relativity, as the case of black holes. A way of constructing regular solutions that remove spacelike singularities consists in implement a bounce on such space-time, leading to what is usually known as black bounce space-times. Such space-times are known to describe regular black holes or traversable wormholes. However, one of the main issues lies on reconstructing the appropriate source that leads to such a solution. In this paper, a reconstruction method is implemented to show that such types of metrics can be well accommodated in non-linear electrodynamics with the presence of a scalar field. Some of the most important black bounces solutions are reconstructed in this framework, both in 3 + 1 as in 2 + 1 dimensions. For the first time in the literature, these solutions have an electrically charged source of matter from non-linear electrodynamics. Specific features are indicated that distinguish electric sources from magnetic ones, previously found for the same space-times.
The behavior of quark matter with both external electric field and chiral chemical potential is theoretically and experimentally interesting to consider. In this paper, the case of simultaneous presence of imaginary electric field and chiral chemical potential is investigated using the lattice QCD approach with\(N_f=1+1\)dynamical staggered fermions. We find that overall both the imaginary electric field and the chiral chemical potential can exacerbate chiral symmetry breaking, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. However we also find a non-monotonic behavior of chiral condensation at specific electric field strengths and chiral chemical potentials. The behavior of Polyakov loop in the complex plane is not significantly affected by chiral chemical potential in the region of the parameters considered.
The critical point of strongly interacting matter is searched for at the CERN SPS by the NA61/SHINE experiment in central\(^{40}\)Ar +\(^{45}\)Sc collisions at 13A, 19A, 30A, 40A, and 75AGeV/c. The dependence of the second-order scaled factorial moments of proton multiplicity distributions on the  number of subdivisions in transverse momentum space is measured. The intermittency analysis uses statistically independent data sets for every subdivision in transverse and cumulative-transverse momentum variables. The results obtained do not indicate the searched intermittent pattern. An upper limit on the fraction of correlated protons and the intermittency index is obtained based on a comparison with the Power-law Model.
Using a symmetry-preserving formulation of a vector\(\,\times \,\)vector contact interaction (SCI) and treating the proton as a quark + interacting-diquark bound state, whose structure is obtained by solving a Poincaré-covariant Faddeev equation, we provide a comprehensive, coherent set of predictions for unpolarised and polarised proton parton distribution functions (DFs): valence, glue, and four-flavour separated sea. The results enable many themes to be addressed, including: the asymmetry of antimatter in the proton; the neutron:proton structure function ratio; helicity retention in hard scattering processes; the charm quark momentum fraction; the sign and size of the polarised gluon DF; and the origin of the proton spin. In all cases where sound analyses of data are available, SCI predictions are semiquantitatively in agreement with the results. Those mismatches which exist are typically attributable to the momentum-independence of the underlying interaction. Judiciously interpreted, the SCI delivers a sound and insightful explanation of proton structure as expressed in DFs.
In this paper, the higher-dimensional topological dS black hole with a nonlinear source (HDTNS) is considered. First, we obtain the thermodynamic quantities of the (\(n+1\))-dimensional topological dS black hole, which satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Second, based on the effective thermodynamic quantities and Maxwell’s equal-area law method, we explore the phase equilibrium for the HDTNS. The boundary of the two-phase coexistence region in the\(P_\textrm{eff}^{0}-T_\textrm{eff}^{0}\)diagram is obtained. The critical thermodynamic quantities as well as the horizon potential are also investigated. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of parameters (the spacetime dimensionnand the ratio of two horizon radii\(x= {r_{+}}\)/\( {r_{c}}\)) on the boundary of the two-phase coexistence region and study the latent heat of phase transition for this system, which corresponds to the Clapeyron equation. The results indicate that the phase transition in HDTNS spacetime is analogous to that in a van der Waals (vdW) fluid system, which is determined by electrical potential at the horizon. These results help to understand the fundamental properties of black holes. A more intuitive and profound understanding of gravity is gained by studying the thermodynamic properties of different spacetimes. They provide a theoretical basis for an in-depth study of the classical and quantum properties of de Sitter spacetime and its evolution.
Stimulated by the recent experimental results on the fully-charm tetraquark states, we systematically calculate the mass spectra of the fully-charm tetraquark states in\(8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes 8_{[c\bar{c}]}\)color configuration via QCD sum rules. By constructing nine\(8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes 8_{[c\bar{c}]}\)type currents with quantum numbers\(J^{PC}=0^{-+},0^{--},1^{-+},1^{+-},1^{--}\)and\(2^{++}\), we perform analytic calculation up to dimension six in the operator product expansion (OPE). We find the fully-charm tetraquark states with\(J^{PC}=1^{+-},2^{++}\)lie around 6.48\(\sim \)6.62 GeV while the fully-charm tetraquark states with\(J^{PC}=0^{-+},0^{--},1^{--},1^{-+}\)are about 6.85\(\sim \)7.02 GeV. Notably, the mass predictions for the\(c\bar{c}c\bar{c}\)tetraquarks, specifically those with\(J^{PC}=2^{++}\), align with the broad structure identified by LHCb. Moreover, the masses of fully-charm tetraquarks with\(J^{PC}=0^{-+}\)and\(1^{-+}\)are anticipated to match closely with the mass of X(6900), considering the margin of error. Such findings hint at the presence of some\(8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes 8_{[c\bar{c}]}\)components within the di-\(J/\psi \)structures observed by LHCb. The predictions for tetraquark states with\(J^{PC}=0^{--},1^{+-},1^{--}\)may be accessible in the future BelleII, Super-B, PANDA, and LHCb experiments.
The quantum theory of relativistic mechanics to deal with the scalar fields behavior in a curved space-time is represented by the Klein–Gordon equation. In this work, we will investigate the gravitationally bound states of massive and massless scalar fields around a Einstein–Yang–Mills–Higgs’s rotating black hole. After applying the standard separation of variables ansatz, we will show in detail how to obtain the novel exact solutions of the radial part of the governing Klein–Gordon equation and express the radial solution in terms of the Confluent Heun functions. By applying the bound state boundary conditions, the Confluent Heun functions are reduced to be polynomials that lead to energy quantization. We find that the scalar fields have complex-valued energy levels that indicate the decaying/growing bound states known as quasibound states. In the end, using the exact radial solution, we derive the radiation distribution function of the black hole’s outer horizon to obtain the equation of the Hawking temperature.
AbstractWe present the Feynman rules for leading-twist gauge-invariant quark and gluon operators with an arbitrary number of total derivatives and applicable to any order in perturbation theory. This generalizes previous results and constitutes a necessary ingredient in the computation of the matrix elements of the corresponding operators. The results are written in a form appropriate for implementation in a computer algebra system. To illustrate the latter we provide implementations inMathematicaandFORM, which are made available athttps://github.com/vtsam/NKLO.Graphical abstract
Presented is the search for anomalous Higgs boson decays into two axion-like particles (ALPs) using the full Run 2 data set of\(140\,\text {fb}^{-1}\)of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of\(13\,\text {TeV}\)recorded by the ATLAS experiment. The ALPs are assumed to decay into two photons, providing sensitivity to recently proposed models that could explain the\((g-2)_\mu \)discrepancy. This analysis covers an ALP mass range from 100 to\(62\,\text {GeV}\)and ALP-photon couplings in the range\(10^{-7}\,\text {TeV}^{-1}<C_{a\gamma \gamma }/\Lambda <1 \,\text {TeV}^{-1}\), and therefore includes signatures with significantly displaced vertices and highly collinear photons. No significant excess of events above the Standard Model background is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are placed on the branching ratio of the Higgs boson to two ALPs in the four-photon final state, and are in the range of\( 10^{-5}\)to\(3\times 10^{-2}\), depending on the hypothesized ALP mass and ALP-photon coupling strength.
In this paper, we propose an approach to derive the brane cosmology in theD-dimensional braneworld model. We generalize the “bulk-based” approach by treating the 4-brane as a small perturbation to theD-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime. The linear corrections from a static 4-brane to the metric are derived from the linearized perturbation equations, while the nonlinear corrections are found by a parameterization of the perturbed metric solution. We use a time-dependent generalization to give the nonlinearly perturbed metric solution for the dynamical braneworld model, and analyze the stability of the model under the motion of the 4-brane. Through the fine tuning, we can recover the Friedmann equations for the universe with and without an effective cosmological constant. More importantly, the de Sitter expansion of the universe can be reproduced.
We study the time-honoured decay\(H^\pm \rightarrow A W^\pm \)but for the first time, we do so for the case of bothAand\(W^\pm \)being off-shell, therefore computing a\(1\rightarrow 4\)body decay. We show that the corresponding decay rate not only extends the reach of\(H^\pm \)searches to small masses of the latter but also that the results of our implementation differ significantly from the yield of the\(1\rightarrow 3\)body decay over the phase space region in which the latter is normally used. We show the phenomenological relevance of this implementation in the case of the so-called lepton-specific 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) over the mass region wherein the aforementioned\(1\rightarrow 4\)body decay can dominate just beyond the top (anti)quark mass. This mass region is accessible in the lepton-specific 2HDM as the Yukawa couplings are such that limits from\(b \rightarrow s \gamma \)and\(\tau \rightarrow \mu \nu _{\tau } \bar{\nu _\mu }\)observables on\(M_{H^\pm }\)are rather mild. However, we emphasize that similar effects may occur in other 2HDM types, as the\(W^\pm H^\mp A\)vertex is 2HDM type independent.
In this paper we use the Homotopy analysis method to obtain an analytic approximation for the entire photon trajectory in the Schwarzschild spacetime. This is usually expressed exactly in terms of an elliptic integral. We compare our approximation with other formulae found in the literature, which were specifically obtained for the Schwarzschild solution. Unlike some of these formulae, our approximation can be applied and maintains a good accuracy for emission point close to the event horizon and also for emission angles close to and greater than\(\pi /2\). We show that our method can easily be applied to other spherically symmetric solutions such as the Reissner-Nordström solution. Such an approximation would be useful when accurate determination of the light trajectories around compact objects is required without the need to revert to time consuming numerical integration of elliptic integrals.
We study the scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) from a chiral scalar–tensor theory of gravity. The parity-violating (PV) Lagrangian contains the Chern–Simons (CS) term and PV scalar–tensor terms, which are built of the quadratic Riemann tensor term and first-order derivatives of a scalar field. We consider SIGWs in two cases, in which the semi-analytic expression to calculate SIGWs can be obtained. Then, we calculate the fractional energy density of SIGWs with a monochromatic power spectrum for the curvature perturbation. We find that the SIGWs in chiral scalar–tensor gravity behave differently from those in GR before and after the peak frequency, which results in a large degree of circular polarization.
The effects of harmful space radiation are one of the biggest concerns for future lunar explorers. Here, we use a data-validated model, the Radiation Environment and Dose on the Moon (REDMoon), to create mission schedules for different scenarios of lunar bases limited by radiation constraints. We consider habitats at the surface and subsurface of the Moon with different regolith and aluminium shielding using the last two solar cycles (2000–2022) as a baseline. The exposure due to background galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is about 66% on the lunar surface than in interplanetary space and can even slightly increase beneath the surface before it decreases to a negligible value at about 3 m depth. If the shielding is insufficient, the surface dose during a single solar particle event could sometimes exceed annual GCR exposure, leading to an immediate replacement of the crew. Our work provides radiation-mitigation considerations for future human lunar bases and exploration cost estimates.
We hypothesis that large earthquakes generate Horndeski-like Gravitational Wave (GW). We find that such a Horndeski-like GW propagates with the speed of sound. The sound waves generated by an earthquake make a local and temporal change to the Earth’s diagravitational medium; therefore, they modify the GW speed in a standard, Alternative-Theory-of-Gravity (ATG) sense. The quantum of the Horndeski-like GW is a massless scalar quasiparticle and cannot exist outside of the propagation region of the P-field. The Horndeski-like GW may be detectable by future GW detectors with a sensitivity of 10–15\(\hbox {Hz}^{{-1/2}}\)in the region of 0.1–1 Hz.
Hybrid neutron stars, the compact objects consisting hadronic matter and strange quark matter, can be considered as the probes for the scalar tensor gravity. In this work, we explore the scalarization of hybrid neutron stars in the scalar tensor gravity. For the hadronic phase, we apply a piecewise polytropic equation of state constrained by the observational data of GW170817 and the data of six low-mass X-ray binaries with thermonuclear burst or the symmetry energy of the nuclear interaction. In addition, to describe the strange quark matter inside the hybrid neutron star, different MIT bag models are employed. We study the effects of the value of bag constant, the mass of s quark, the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter, and the density jump at the surface of quark-hadronic phase transition on the scalarization of hybrid neutron stars. Our results confirm that the scalarization is more sensitive to the value of bag constant, the mass of s quark, and the density jump compared to the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter.
We investigate shadows, deflection angle, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and sparsity of Hawking radiation of the Schwarzschild string cloud black hole’s solution after applying quantum corrections required by the Generalised Uncertainty Principle (GUP). First, we explore the shadow’s behaviour in the presence of a string cloud using three alternative GUP frameworks: linear quadratic GUP (LQGUP), quadratic GUP (QGUP), and linear GUP. We then used the weak field limit approach to determine the effect of the string cloud and GUP parameters on the light deflection angle, with computation based on the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. Next, to compute the quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild string clouds incorporating quantum correction with GUP, we determine the effective potentials generated by perturbing scalar, electromagnetic and fermionic fields, using the sixth-order WKB approach in conjunction with the appropriate numerical analysis. Our investigation indicates that string and linear GUP parameters have distinct and different effects on QNMs. We find that the greybody factor increases due to the presence of string cloud while the linear GUP parameter shows the opposite. We then examine the radiation spectrum and sparsity in the GUP corrected black hole with the cloud of string framework, which provides additional information about the thermal radiation released by black holes. Finally, our inquiries reveal that the influence of the string parameter and the quadratic GUP parameter on various astrophysical observables is comparable, however the impact of the linear GUP parameter is opposite.
Multiquarks can have two-hadron components and hidden-color components in their wave functions. The presence of two-hadron components in multiquarks introduces a potential source of confusion, particularly with respect to their resemblance to hadronic molecules. On the other hand, hidden-color components are essential for distinguishing between multiquarks and hadronic molecules. In this work, we study the hidden-color components in the wave functions of the tetraquark mixing model, a model that has been proposed as a suitable framework for describing the properties of two nonets in the\(J^{P}=0^{+}\)channel: the light nonet [\(a_{0} (980)\),\(K_{0}^{*} (700)\),\(f_{0} (500)\),\(f_{0} (980)\)] and the heavy nonet [\(a_{0} (1450)\),\(K_{0}^* (1430)\),\(f_{0} (1370)\),\(f_{0} (1500)\)]. Our analysis reveals a substantial presence of hidden-color components within the tetraquark wave functions. To elucidate the impact of hidden-color components on physical quantities, we conduct computations of the hyperfine masses,\(\langle V_{CS}\rangle \), for the two nonets, considering scenarios involving only the two-meson components and those incorporating the hidden-color components. We demonstrate that the hidden-color components constitute an important part of the hyperfine masses, such that the mass difference formula,\(\Delta M\approx \Delta \langle V_{CS}\rangle \), which has been successful for the two nonets, cannot be achieved without the hidden-color contributions. This can provide another evidence supporting the tetraquark nature of the two nonets.
Dark matter density can be significantly enhanced by the supermassive black hole at the galactic center, leading to a structure called dark matter spike. Dark matter spike may change the spacetime properties of black holes that constitute deviations from GR black holes. Based on these interesting background, we construct a set of solutions of black holes in a dark matter spike under the Newtonian approximation and full relativity. Combining the mass model of M87, we study the quasinormal modes of black holes in the scalar field and axial gravitational perturbation, then compared them with Schwarzschild black hole. Besides, the impacts of dark matter on the quasinormal mode of black holes have been studied in depth. In particular, in the axial gravitational perturbation, our results show that the impacts of dark matter spike on the quasinormal mode of black holes can reach up to\(10^{-4}\). These new features from quasinormal mode of black holes under the Newtonian approximation and full relativity may provide some help for the establishment of the final dark matter model, and provide a new thought for the indirect detection of dark matter.
In this paper, we would like to examine whether stable de Sitter inflationary solutions appear within power-law extensions of the Starobinsky model. In particular, we will address general constraints for the existence along with the stability of de Sitter inflationary solutions in a general case involving not only the Starobinsky\(R^2\)term but also an additional power-law\(R^n\)one. According to the obtained results, we will be able to identify which extension is more suitable for an early inflationary phase rather than a late-time cosmic acceleration phase. To be more specific, we will consider several values ofnto see whether the corresponding de Sitter inflationary solutions are stable or not.
We consider the light emitters moving freely along the geodesics on the equatorial plane near a Kerr black hole and study the observability of these emitters. To do so, we assume these emitters emit photons isotropically and monochromatically, and we compute the photon escaping probability (PEP) and the maximum observable blueshift (MOB) of the photons that reach infinity. We obtain numerical results of PEP and MOB for the emitters along various geodesic orbits, which exhibit distinct features for the trajectories of different classes. In particular, we find that the plunging emitters could have considerable observability even in the near-horizon region. This interesting observational feature becomes more significant for the high-energy emitters near a high-spin black hole. As the radiatively-inefficient accretion flow may consist of plunging emitters, the present work could be of great relevance to the astrophysical observations.
Twist-3 collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) are matrix elements of quark-gluon-quark or three-gluons light-cone operators. They depend on three momentum fraction variables, which are restricted to a hexagon region, and the evolution kernels are defined via two-dimensional convolution in these variables. We present the numerical realisation of the twist-3 evolution equations at leading order in the strong coupling for all kinds of twist-3 PDF (quark, gluon, chiral-even/odd, etc). We provide two independent codes (in C and Fortran) that have been extensively cross-checked, and are ready-to-use. We supplement the paper with a review of known properties of twist-3 PDFs.
We extend the derivation of mass formulas for stationary axisymmetric asymptotically locally flat solutions with string singularities on the polar axis to general supergravity actions containing vector and scalar fields. It is based on the rod structure of the solutions in Weyl coordinates and is applicable to black holes with Dirac and Misner strings. The obtained formulas differ from the corresponding ones in Einstein–Maxwell theory only by summation over all independent electric charges.
Many of the most sensitive physics experiments searching for rare events, like neutrinoless double beta (\(0\nu \beta \beta \)) decay, coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering and dark matter interactions, rely on cryogenic macro-calorimeters operating at the mK-scale. Located underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), in central Italy, CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is one of the leading experiments for the search of\(0\nu \beta \beta \)decay, implementing the low-temperature calorimetric technology. We present a novel multi-device analysis to correlate environmental phenomena with the low-frequency noise of low-temperature calorimeters. Indeed, the correlation of marine and seismic data with data from a couple of CUORE detectors indicates that cryogenic detectors are sensitive not only to intense vibrations generated by earthquakes, but also to the much fainter vibrations induced by marine microseisms in the Mediterranean Sea due to the motion of sea waves. Proving that cryogenic macro-calorimeters are sensitive to such environmental sources of noise opens the possibility of studying their impact on the detectors physics-case sensitivity. Moreover, this study could pave the road for technology developments dedicated to the mitigation of the noise induced by marine microseisms, from which the entire community of cryogenic calorimeters can benefit.
This work is seeking for the existence of stable quark stars (QSs) in the framework of a modified theory of gravity known as gravity’s rainbow. This modification comes from the fact that the geometry of spacetime depends on the energy of the test particle. We solve numerically the modified TOV equations and present the mass–radius (M–R) diagram for quark matter equations of state. To constrain the allowed values of the model parameters, we use current astrophysical measurements of the masses and radii of neutron stars. Finally, we investigate the dynamical stability of the hydrostatic equilibrium equations in gravity’s rainbow by analyzing the static stability, adiabatic index, and sound velocity profiles.
Reference introduces a method for computing numerically four-dimensional multi-loop integrals without performing an explicit analytic contour deformation around threshold singularities. In this paper, we extend such a technique to massless scalar one-loop integrals regularized in the framework of dimensional regularization. A two-loop example is also discussed.
In this paper, we obtain a complete list of stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes, generated from a Minkowski spacetime using the Ernst technique. We do so by operating on the associated seed potentials with a composition of Ehlers and Harrison transformations. In particular, assigning an additional “electric” or “magnetic” tag to the transformations, we investigate the new spacetimes obtained either via a composition of magnetic Ehlers and Harrison transformations (first part) or via a magnetic-electric combination (second part). In the first part, the resulting type D spacetime, dubbed electromagnetic swirling universe, features key properties, separately found in swirling and (Bonnor–)Melvin spacetimes, the latter recovered in appropriate limits. A detailed analysis of the geometry is included, and subtle issues are addressed. A detailed proof that the spacetime belongs to the Kundt family, is included, and a notable relation to the5 planar-Reissner–Nordström-NUT black hole is also meticulously worked out. This relation is further exploited to reverse-engineer the form of the solution in the presence of a nontrivial cosmological constant. A Schwarzschild black hole embedded into the new background is also discussed. In the second part, we present four novel stationary and axisymmetric asymptotically nonflat type I spacetimes, which are naively expected to be extensions of the Melvin or swirling solution including a NUT parameter or electromagnetic charges. We actually find that they are, under conditions, free of curvature and topological singularities, with the physical meaning of the electric transformation parameters in these backgrounds requiring further investigation.
Dark photon is a new gauge boson beyond the Standard Model as a kind of dark matter (DM) candidate. Dark photon dark matter (DPDM) interacts with electromagnetic fields via kinetic mixing, implicating an approach to give a constraint with extragalactic very high energy (VHE) sources. In this work, we attempt to constrain the kinetic mixing from the photon-dark photon scattering process in the host galaxy of blazar, the intergalactic medium and the Milky Way. The VHE photons from a blazar would pass through a dense DM spike around the supermassive black hole where the absorption from DPDM is dramatically enhanced. The kinetic mixing is constrained to be\(\epsilon \sim 10^{-7}\)at a 95\(\%\)confidence level with\(m_\textrm{D}\sim 0.03 {-} 1\)eV mass range from the observations of Markarian (Mrk) 421 and Mrk 501.
The hierarchical model of galaxy evolution suggests that mergers have a substantial impact on the intricate processes that drive stellar assembly within a galaxy. However, accurately measuring the contribution of accretion to a galaxy’s total stellar mass and its balance with in situ star formation poses a persistent challenge, as it is neither directly observable nor easily inferred from observational properties. Using data from MaNGA, we present theory-motivated predictions for the fraction of stellar mass originating from mergers in a statistically significant sample of nearby galaxies. Employing a robust machine learning model trained on mock MaNGA analogues (MaNGIA) obtained from a cosmological simulation (TNG50), we unveil that in situ stellar mass dominates almost across the entire stellar mass spectrum (109M⊙<M⋆< 1012M⊙). Only in more massive galaxies (M⋆> 1011M⊙) does accreted mass become a substantial contributor, reaching up to 35–40% of the total stellar mass. Notably, the ex situ stellar mass in the nearby Universe exhibits notable dependence on galaxy characteristics, with higher accreted fractions favoured being by elliptical, quenched galaxies and slow rotators, as well as galaxies at the centre of more massive dark matter haloes.
We discuss a Bayesian methodology for the solution of the inverse problem underlying the determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs). In our approach, Gaussian processes (GPs) are used to model the PDF prior, while Bayes’ theorem is used in order to determine the posterior distribution of the PDFs given a set of data. We discuss the general formalism, the Bayesian inference at the level of both parameters and hyperparameters, and the simplifications which occur when the observable entering the analysis is linear in the PDF. We benchmark the new methodology in two simple examples for the determination of a single PDF flavor from a set of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) data and from a set of equal-time correlators computed using lattice QCD. We discuss our results, showing how the proposed methodology allows for a well-defined statistical interpretation of the different sources of errors entering the PDF uncertainty, and how results can be validated a posteriori.
Recently Tsallis cosmology has been presented as a novel proposal for alleviating both\(H_0\)and\(\sigma _8\)tensions. Hence a universe filled with matter and radiation as perfect fluids and considering the Tsallis entropy is confronted using recent cosmological measurements coming from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, hydrogen II galaxies, quasars, and baryon acoustic oscillations. Following a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis and combining the samples, we constrain the main characteristic parameters\(\alpha = 1.031^{+0.054}_{-0.051}\)and\(\delta = 1.005^{+0.001}_{-0.001}\)where the uncertainties are\(1\sigma \)confidence level. Additionally, we estimate the current deceleration parameter\(q_0=-0.530^{+0.018}_{-0.017}\), the deceleration-acceleration transition redshift\(z_T=0.632^{+0.028}_{-0.028}\)and the age of the universe\(\tau _U = 12.637^{+0.067}_{-0.066}\,\textrm{Gyrs}\)which are in agreement with the standard cosmology (\(\Lambda \)CDM) within\(1.5\sigma \). Furthermore, we find that the dark energy equation of state is consistent with both phantom and quintessence behaviors within\(1\sigma \)in the past and converging to\(\Lambda \)CDM in the future. Additionally, we find agreement values of\(H_0\)within\(1\sigma \)with the SH0ES values when the CMB distance priors are added to the analysis, suggesting that\(H_0\)tension could be alleviated. Finally, Tsallis cosmology is preferred over\(\Lambda \)CDM by the combined data that motives further studies at the perturbation level.
The Breit frame provides a natural frame to analyze lepton–proton scattering events. In this reference frame, the parton model hard interactions between a quark and an exchanged boson defines the coordinate system such that the struck quark is back-scattered along the virtual photon momentum direction. In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), higher order perturbative or non-perturbative effects can change this picture drastically. As Bjorken-xdecreases below one half, a rather peculiar event signature is predicted with increasing probability, where no radiation is present in one of the two Breit-frame hemispheres and all emissions are to be found in the other hemisphere. At higher orders in\(\alpha _{s}\)or in the presence of soft QCD effects, predictions of the rate of these events are far from trivial, and that motivates measurements with real data. We report on the first observation of the empty current hemisphere events in electron–proton collisions at the HERA collider using data recorded with the H1 detector at a center-of-mass energy of 319 GeV. The fraction of inclusive neutral-current DIS events with an empty hemisphere is found to be\(0.0112 \pm 3.9\%_\text {stat} \pm 4.5\%_{\text {syst}} \pm 1.6\%_{\text {mod}}\)in the selected kinematic region of\(150<Q^{2} <1500\, \textrm{GeV}^2 \)and inelasticity\(0.14<y<0.7\). The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 351.1 pb\({}^{-1}\), sufficient to enable differential cross section measurements of these events. The results show an enhanced discriminating power at lower Bjorken-xamong different Monte Carlo event generator predictions.
The situation of the experimental data used in the dispersive evaluation of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is assessed in view of two recent measurements:\(e^+e^- \rightarrow \pi ^+\pi ^-\)cross sections in the\(\rho \)resonance region by CMD-3 and a study of higher-order radiative effects in the initial-state-radiation processes\(e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-\gamma \)and\(e^+e^- \rightarrow \pi ^+\pi ^-\gamma \)by BABAR. The impact of the latter study on the KLOE and BESIII cross-section measurements is evaluated and found to be indicative of larger systematic effects than uncertainties assigned. The new situation also warrants a reappraisal of the independent information provided by hadronic\(\tau \)decays, including state-of-the-art isospin-breaking corrections. The findings cast a new light on the longstanding deviation between the muong– 2 measurement and the Standard Model prediction using the data-driven dispersive approach, and the comparison with lattice QCD calculations.
A search is reported for long-lived dark photons with masses between 0.1 GeV and 15 GeV, from exotic decays of Higgs bosons produced via vector-boson-fusion. Events that contain displaced collimated Standard Model fermions reconstructed in the calorimeter or muon spectrometer are probed. This search uses the full LHC Run 2 (2015–2018) data sample collected in proton–proton collisions at\(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139\(fb^{-1}\). Dominant backgrounds from Standard Model processes and non-collision sources are estimated using data-driven techniques. The observed event yields in the signal regions are consistent with the expected background. Upper limits on the Higgs boson to dark photon branching fraction are reported as a function of the dark photon mean proper decay length or of the dark photon mass and the coupling between the Standard Model and the potential dark sector. This search is combined with previous ATLAS searches obtained in the gluon–gluon fusion andWHproduction modes. A branching fraction above 10% is excluded at 95% CL for a 125 GeV Higgs boson decaying into two dark photons for dark photon mean proper decay lengths between 173 and 1296 mm and mass of 10 GeV.
The H1 Collaboration at HERA reports the first measurement of groomed event shape observables in deep inelastic electron-proton scattering (DIS) at\(\sqrt{s} =319~\)GeV, using data recorded between the years 2003 and 2007 with an integrated luminosity of 351\(\textrm{pb}^{-1}\). Event shapes provide incisive probes of perturbative and non-perturbative QCD. Grooming techniques have been used for jet measurements in hadronic collisions; this paper presents the first application of grooming to DIS data. The analysis is carried out in the Breit frame, utilizing the novel Centauro jet clustering algorithm that is designed for DIS event topologies. Events are required to have squared momentum-transfer\(Q^2 > 150\)GeV\(^2\)and inelasticity\( 0.2< y < 0.7\). We report measurements of the production cross section of groomed event 1-jettiness and groomed invariant mass for several choices of grooming parameter. Monte Carlo model calculations and analytic calculations based on Soft Collinear Effective Theory are compared to the measurements.
The global monopole solutions which give rise to quite unusual physical phenomena have captured considerable attention. In this paper, we study the Einstein ring of the spherically symmetric AdS black hole solution with a global monopole based on the AdS/CFT correspondence. With the help of the given response function of the QFT on the boundary, we construct the holographic images of the black hole in the bulk. Our results exhibit the absolute amplitude of total response function\(|\langle \mathcal {O}\rangle |\)increases with the decrease of the monopole parameterband the temperatureT. And the frequency\(\omega \)of the Gaussian source will also increase the absolute amplitude. These parameters also affects the Einstein ring. With the change of the observation position, this ring will change from the concentric stripe to a luminosity-deformed ring, or light points. And the monopole parameter has an effect on the brightness and the position of Einstein ring. All these results imply that the holographic images can be used as an effective tool to distinguish different types of black holes for fixed wave source and optical system. These theoretical proposal opens a door to gravitational phenomena on strongly correlated material. Therefore, the holographic Einstein ring is of great theoretical and experimental significance for our research. In theory, it provides us a new way to find a necessary condition for the existence of the dual black hole. And experimentally speaking, if we can realize suitable targets for observing AdS black holes successfully, we would be able to observe Einstein rings by tabletop experiments when we apply localized sources on such materials and measure their responses.
In generic closed quantum systems, the complexity of operators increases under time evolution governed by the Heisenberg equation, reflecting the scrambling of local quantum information. However, when systems interact with an external environment, the system-environment coupling allows operators to escape from the system, inducing a dynamical transition between the scrambling phase and the dissipative phase. This transition is known as the environment-induced information scrambling transition, originally proposed in Majorana fermion systems. In this work, we advance this discovery by investigating the transition in charge-conserved systems with space-time randomness. We construct solvable Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models of complex fermions coupled to an environment, enabling the analytical computation of operator growth. We determine the critical dissipation strength, which is proportional to\(n(1-n)\)withnbeing the density of the complex fermions, arising from the suppression in the quantum Lyapunova exponent due to the Pauli blockade in the scattering process. We further analyze the density dependence of maximally scrambled operators at late time. Our results shed light on the intriguing interplay between information scrambling, dissipation, and conservation laws.
Extrapolations of sensitivity to new interactions and standard model parameters critically inform the programme at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and potential future collider cases. To this end, statistical considerations based on inclusive quantities and established analysis strategies typically give rise to a sensitivity scaling with the square root of the luminosity,\(\sqrt{\mathcal {L}}\). This suggests only a mild sensitivity improvement for LHC’s high-luminosity phase, compared to the collected data up to the year 2025. We discuss representative analyses in top quark, Higgs boson and electroweak gauge boson phenomenology and provide clear evidence that the assumption that the sensitivity in searches and measurement scales only with\(\sqrt{\mathcal {L}}\)at the High-Luminosity LHC is overly conservative at best, and unrealistic in practice. As kinematic coverage enables more targeted search strategies with sufficient statistical sensitivity, employing a multitude of features in data dispels the scaling based on more inclusive selections.
A search for\({\text {Z}{}{}} {\text {Z}{}{}} \)and\({\text {Z}{}{}} {\text {H}{}{}} \)production in the\({\text {b}{}{}} {\bar{{\text {b}{}{}}}{}{}} {\text {b}{}{}} {\bar{{\text {b}{}{}}}{}{}} \)final state is presented, where H is the standard model (SM) Higgs boson. The search uses an event sample of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 133\(\,\text {fb}^{-1}\)collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13\(\,\text {Te}\hspace{-.08em}\text {V}\)with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The analysis introduces several novel techniques for deriving and validating a multi-dimensional background model based on control samples in data. A multiclass multivariate classifier customized for the\({\text {b}{}{}} {\bar{{\text {b}{}{}}}{}{}} {\text {b}{}{}} {\bar{{\text {b}{}{}}}{}{}} \)final state is developed to derive the background model and extract the signal. The data are found to be consistent, within uncertainties, with the SM predictions. The observed (expected) upper limits at 95% confidence level are found to be 3.8 (3.8) and 5.0 (2.9) times the SM prediction for the\({\text {Z}{}{}} {\text {Z}{}{}} \)and\({\text {Z}{}{}} {\text {H}{}{}} \)production cross sections, respectively.
The gravitational waves emitted by neutron star binaries probe the physics of matter at supranuclear densities. During the late inspiral, tidal deformations raised on each star by the gravitational field of its companion depend crucially on the star’s internal properties. The misalignment of a star’s tidal bulge with its companion’s gravitational field encodes the strength of internal dissipative processes, which imprint onto the phase of the gravitational waves emitted. Here, we analyse gravitational wave data from the GW170817 (binary neutron star) event detected by LIGO and Virgo and find a constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of a neutron star. From this constraint, assuming a temperature profile for each star in the binary, we obtain an order of magnitude bound on the averaged bulk (ζ) and shear (η) viscosity of each star during the inspiral:ζ≲ 1031g cm−1s−1andη≲ 1028g cm−1s−1. We forecast that these bounds could be improved by two orders of magnitude with third-generation detectors, like Cosmic Explorer, using inspiral data. These constraints already inform nuclear physics models and motivate further theoretical work to better understand the interplay between viscosity and temperature in the late inspiral of neutron stars.
We generalize previous studies on constraining operators of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory using Drell-Yan (DY) measurements to include at the same time all relevant operators and uncertainties. It has been shown that fully differential measurements (triple differential for neutral and double differential for charged) are more sensitive to EFT effects. Nevertheless, due to the finite statistics, the fully differential measurements sacrifice some statistical power on the shape (less invariant mass or transverse momentum bins) in favour of more kinematic variables. We show that when the observables are particularly sensitive to the shape of the distributions, such as the invariant mass of the two leptons in neutral DY, the single differential measurement with more bins, may be as sensitive as the fully differential one, at least for specific EFT operators. This suggests to always supplement fully differential analyses with projections into the relevant distributions evaluated with finer bins.
Bilayer (BL) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are important materials in valleytronics and twistronics. Here we study terahertz (THz) magneto-optical (MO) properties of n-type 2H-stacking BL molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) on sapphire substrate grown by chemical vapor deposition. The AFM, Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence are used for characterization of the samples. Applying THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS), in combination with polarization test and the presence of magnetic field in Faraday geometry, THz MO transmissions through the sample are measured from 0 to 8 T at 80 K. The complex right- and left-handed circular MO conductivities for 2H-stacking BL MoS2are obtained. Through fitting the experimental results with theoretical formula of MO conductivities for an electron gas, generalized by us previously through the inclusion of photon-induced electronic backscattering effect, we are able to determine magneto-optically the key electronic parameters of BL MoS2, such as the electron densityne, the electronic relaxation timeτ, the electronic localization factorcand, particularly, the effective electron massm*aroundQ-point in between theK- and Γ-point in the electronic band structure. The dependence of these parameters upon magnetic field is examined and analyzed. This is a pioneering experimental work to measurem*around theQ-point in 2H-stacking BL MoS2and the experimental value is very close to that obtained theoretically. We find thatne/τ/ ∣c∣ /m*in 2H-stacking BL MoS2decreases/increases/decreases/increases with increasing magnetic field. The results obtained from this study can be benefit to us in gaining an in-depth understanding of the electronic and optoelectronic properties of BL TMD systems.
In this paper, employing the exponential corrected entropy (Chatterjee and Ghosh in Phys Rev Lett 125:041302, 2020), we derive the modified Friedmann equations from the first law of thermodynamics at apparent horizon and Verlinde’s entropic gravity scenario. First, we derive the modified Friedmann equations from the first law of thermodynamics. We investigate the validity of generalised second law (GSL) of thermodynamics and find that it is always satisfied for the all eras of universe. Moreover, we investigate the deceleration parameter for the case\(k=0\)in two frameworks. Finally, we numerically study the bouncing behaviour for the modified Friedmann equations obtained from entropic gravity. The results indicate that the bouncing behaviour is possible for the cases\(k=1\)and\(k=-1\).
We study the interior metric of 4D spherically symmetric static black holes by using the semi-classical Einstein equation and find a consistent class of geometries with large curvatures. We approximate the matter fields by conformal fields and consider the contribution of the 4D Weyl anomaly, giving a state-independent constraint. Combining this with an equation of state yields an equation that determines the interior geometry completely. We explore the solution space of the equation in a non-perturbative manner for\(\hbar \). First, we find four types of asymptotic behaviors and examine the general features of the solutions. Then, by imposing physical conditions, we obtain approximately a general class of interior geometries: various combinations of dilute and dense structures without a horizon or singularity. This represents the diversity of the interior structure. Finally, we show that the number of possible patterns of such interior geometries corresponds to the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy.
As the homologous compounds of MoSi2N4, the MoSi2N4(MoN)nmonolayers have been synthesized in a recent experiment. These systems consist of homogeneous metal nitride multilayers sandwiched between two SiN surfaces, which extends the septuple-atomic-layer MSi2N4system to ultra-thick MSi2N4(MN)nforms. In this paper, we perform a first-principles study on the MoSi2N4(FeN) monolayer, which is constructed by iron molybdenum nitride intercalated into the SiN layers. As a cousin of MoSi2N4(MoN), this double transition-metal system exhibits robust structural stability from the energetic, mechanical, dynamical and thermal perspectives. Different from the MoSi2N4(MoN) one, the MoSi2N4(FeN) monolayer possesses intrinsic ferromagnetism and presents a bipolar magnetic semiconducting behaviour. The ferromagnetism can be further enhanced by the surface hydrogenation, which raises the Curie temperature to 310 K around room temperature. More interestingly, the hydrogenated MoSi2N4(FeN) monolayer exhibits a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulating behaviour with a sizeable nontrivial band gap of 0.23 eV. The nontrivial topological character can be well described by a two-bandk · pmodel, confirming a non-zero Chern number ofC= 1. Similar bipolar magnetic semiconducting feature and hydrogenation-induced QAH state are also present in the WSi2N4(FeN) monolayer. Our study demonstrates that the double transition-metal MSi2N4(M′N) system will be a fertile platform to achieve fascinating spintronic and topological properties.
Astronomical observatories have been identified as substantial contributors to the carbon footprint of astrophysical research. Being part of the collaboration that is currently developing the medium-sized telescopes in the Cherenkov Telescope Array, a ground-based observatory for very-high-energy γ-rays that will comprise 64 telescopes deployed on two sites, we assessed the environmental impacts of one medium-sized telescope on the northern site with a life-cycle assessment. We identified resource use and climate change as having the most significant impacts due to telescope manufacturing and energy consumption during operations. We estimate life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of 2,660 ± 274 tCO2e for the telescope, 44% of which arise from construction, 1% from on-site assembly and commissioning and 55% from operations over 30 yr. The environmental impacts could be reduced by using renewable energy during construction and operations, using fewer electronic components and metal casting and using recycled materials. We propose complementing the project requirements with environmental budgets as an effective measure for impact management and reductions.
We present a digitization scheme for the lattice\({\textrm{SU}}(2)\)gauge theory Hamiltonian in themagnetic basis, where the gauge links are unitary and diagonal. The digitization is obtained from a particular partitioning of the\({\textrm{SU}}(2)\)group manifold, with the canonical momenta constructed by an approximation of the Lie derivatives on this partitioning. This construction, analogous to a discrete Fourier transform, preserves the spectrum of the electric part of the Hamiltonian and the canonical commutation relations exactly on a subspace of the truncated Hilbert space, while the residual subspace can be projected above the cutoff of the theory.
We revisit neutrino oscillations in constant matter density for a number of different scenarios: three flavors with the standard Wolfenstein matter potential, four flavors with standard matter potential and three flavors with non-standard matter potentials. To calculate the oscillation probabilities for these scenarios one must determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonians. We use a method for calculating the eigenvalues that is well known, determination of the zeros of determinant of matrix\((\lambda I -H)\), where H is the Hamiltonian, I the identity matrix and\(\lambda \)is a scalar. To calculate the associated eigenvectors we use a method that is little known in the particle physics community, the calculation of the adjugate (transpose of the cofactor matrix) of the same matrix,\((\lambda I -H)\). This method can be applied to any Hamiltonian, but provides a very simple way to determine the eigenvectors for neutrino oscillation in matter, independent of the complexity of the matter potential. This method can be trivially automated using the Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm for numerical calculations. For the above scenarios we derive a number of quantities that are invariant of the matter potential, many are new such as the generalization of the Naumov–Harrison–Scott identity for four or more flavors of neutrinos. We also show how these matter potential independent quantities become matter potential dependent when off-diagonal non-standard matter effects are included.
Cobalt pnictides have been theoretically proposed to be attractive candidates for high-temperature superconductors. Additionally, monolayered CoX (X = As, Sb, Bi) on SrTiO3systems present a potential new platform for realizing topological superconductors in the two-dimensional limit, due to their nontrivial band topology. To this end, we have successfully fabricated high-quality CoBi nanoislands on SrTiO3(001) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy followed by an investigation of their atomic structure and electronic properties via in situ scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. Beyond the previously predicted lattice witha=b= 3.5 Å, 2 × 1 dimer row was observed in this study. Furthermore, our results reveal that the topography of CoBi islands is strongly influenced by various growth conditions, such as substrate temperature, the flux ratio between Co and Bi, and the annealing process. This study paves the way for further explorations of the superconductivity and topological properties of cobalt pnictide systems.
General relativity (GR) is a well-tested theory of gravity in strong and weak field regimes. Many modifications to this theory were obtained, including different scalar, vector, and tensor fields to the GR with non-minimal coupling to gravity. Kalb–Ramond (KR) gravity is also a modified theory formulated in the presence of a bosonic field. One astrophysical way to test gravity is by studying the motion of test particles in the spacetime of black holes (BH). In this work, we study the circular motion of charged particles and explore energetic processes around charged BHs in KR theory. First, we investigated the event horizon radius and analyzed horizon-no horizon regions in the BH charge and KR parameter space. Considering the Coulomb interaction, we derive and analyze the effective potential for charged particles around a charged KR BH. We investigate charged particles’ angular momentum and energy corresponding to circular orbits. We also investigate how the KR non-minimal coupling parameter affects the radius of the innermost stable circular orbits, the corresponding energy, and the angular momentum. We also investigated the electric Penrose process and charged-particle collisions near the KR BH. The presence of the nonzero KR parameter results in a decrease in the energy efficiency of the Penrose process. Also obtained is that the KR parameter’s positive (negative) values cause a decrease (increase) in the center of mass energy of colliding particles near the BH horizon.
We offer a concrete example exhibiting marked departure from the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter\(\gamma \)in Brans–Dicke gravity for spherical compact stars, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of the stars. We achieve this by exploiting theintegrabilityof the 00-component of the Brans–Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result\(\gamma _{\,\text {PPN}}=\frac{\omega +1}{\omega +2}\), we obtain the analytical expression\(\gamma _{\,\text {exact}}=\frac{\omega +1+(\omega +2)\Theta }{\omega +2+(\omega +1)\Theta }\)where\(\Theta \)is the ratio of the total pressure\(P_{\parallel }^{*}+2P_{\perp }^{*}\)and total energy\(E^{*}\)contained within the star. The dimensionless quantity\(\Theta \)participates in\(\gamma \)due to the scalar degree of freedom of Brans–Dicke gravity. Ournon-perturbativeformula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the star. In addition, we establish two new mathematical identities linking the active gravitational mass, the ADM (Arnowitt–Deser–Misner) mass, and the Tolman mass, applicable for Brans–Dicke gravity. We draw four key conclusions:(1) The usual\(\gamma _{\,\text {PPN}}\)formula is violated for high-pressure mass sources, such as neutron stars, viz. when\(\Theta \ne 0\), revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans–Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN formula for\(\gamma \). Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when\(\Theta \approx 0\), for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on\(\gamma \)setjointbounds on\(\omega \)and\(\Theta \), with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter comprising the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing\(\Theta \simeq 1\),\(\gamma _{\,\text {exact}}\)converges to 1irrespectiveof\(\omega \). More generally, regardless of\(\omega \), ultra-relativistic matter tends to suppress the scalar degree of freedom in the exterior vacuum of Brans–Dicke stars, reducing the vacuum to the Schwarzschild solution. (4) In a broader context, by exposing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans–Dicke gravity, our findings indicate the significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy when testing candidate theories of gravitation that involve additional degrees of freedom besides the metric tensor.
We consider a two\(\beta \)-ensemble realization of the series of\(\beta \)-deformed WLZZ matrix models. We demonstrate that such a realization involves\(\beta \)-deformed Harish-Chandra–Itzykson–Zuber integrals, one of them providing a coupling to the external field. We also construct Ward identities in the corresponding two\(\beta \)-ensemble model, which requires a set of identities for partition function of the one\(\beta \)-ensemble in the external field, and a set of identities for the\(\beta \)-deformed Itzykson-Zuber integral. These both sets of identities are formulated in terms of the Dunkl operators.
The production of a single charged Higgs boson pair by photon–photon interactions inppcollisions at the LHC is investigated in this exploratory study. We focus on the exclusive production, which is characterized by intact protons and two-rapidity gaps in the final state, and assume the type-I two-Higgs-doublet model, which still allows a light charged Higgs. Assuming the leptonic\(H^{\pm }\rightarrow [\tau \nu _{\tau }]\)decay mode, we derive predictions for the transverse momentum, rapidity and invariant mass distributions of the\(\tau ^+ \tau ^-\)pair for different values of the charged Higgs mass. The contributions of different background processes are also estimated. Our results indicate that the contribution of the exclusive\(H^+ H^-\)production for the\([\tau ^{+}\nu _{\tau }][\tau ^{-} \nu _{\tau }]\)final state is non-negligible and can, in principle, be used to searching for a light charged Higgs.
In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the angular diameter distance (ADD) derived from the transverse Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data with the luminosity distance (LD) from the Pantheon type Ia supernova (SNIa) sample. The binning method and Gaussian process are employed to match ADD data with LD data at the same redshift. First, we use nonparametric and parametric methods to investigate the impact of the specific prior values of the absolute magnitude\(M_\textrm{B}\)from SNIa observations and the sound horizon scale\(r_\textrm{s}\)from transverse BAO measurements on the CDDR tests. The results obtained from the parametric and non-parametric methods indicate that specific prior values of\(M_\textrm{B}\)and\(r_\textrm{s}\)lead to significant biases on the CDDR test. Then, to avoid these biases, we propose a method independent of\(M_\textrm{B}\)and\(r_\textrm{s}\)to test CDDR by considering the fiducial value of\(\kappa \equiv 10^{M_\textrm{B} \over 5}r_\textrm{s}\)as a nuisance parameter and then marginalizing its influence with a flat prior in the analysis. No violation of the CDDR is found, and the transverse BAO measurement can be used as a powerful tool to verify the validity of CDDR in the cosmological-model-independent method.
The presence and distribution of water on the Moon are fundamental to our understanding of the Earth–Moon system. Despite extensive laboratory research and remote sensing explorations, the origin and chemical form of lunar water have remained elusive. In this study we present the discovery of a hydrated mineral, (NH4)MgCl3·6H2O, in lunar soil samples returned by the Chang’e-5 mission that contains approximately 41 wt% H2O. The mineral’s structure and composition closely resemble novograblenovite, a terrestrial fumarole mineral formed through the reaction of hot basalt with water-rich volcanic gases, and carnallite, an Earth evaporite mineral. We rule out terrestrial contamination or rocket exhaust as the origin of this hydrate on the basis of its chemical and isotopic compositions and formation conditions. The presence of ammonium indicates a more complex lunar degassing history and highlights its potential as a resource for lunar habitation. Our findings also suggest that water molecules can persist in sunlit areas of the Moon as hydrated salts, providing crucial constraints on the fugacity of water and ammonia vapour in lunar volcanic gases.
General exotic bi-gravity, obtained in Ozkan et al. (Phys Rev Lett 123(3):031303, 2019), is a unitary parity-preserving model which describes two interacting spin-two fields in three-dimensional spacetime. Adopting a symplectic viewpoint, we investigate the dynamical structure of general exotic bi-gravity theory. In particular, by exploiting the properties of the corresponding pre-symplectic matrix and its associated zero-modes, we explicitly derive all constraints of the theory, including the integrability conditions and scalar relationships between all the parameters and fields defining the model. Then, as an application, these scalar relationships are used for studying the anti-de Sitter background. After that, we derive the gauge transformations for the dynamical variables from the structure of the remaining zero-modes, meaning that such zero-modes are indeed the generators of the gauge symmetry of the theory. Finally, by switching off one of the four coupling constants\(\beta _{n}\)and assuming the invertibility of some of the dreibeins, we find that the general exotic bi-gravity theory has two physical degrees of freedom.
In this paper, we extend Chandrasekhar’s method of calculating rotating black holes intof(R) theory. We show that the solution with constant Ricci scalar always exists in a generalf(R) gravity and derive the Kerr and Kerr-Ads metric by using the analytical mathematical method. Suppose that the spacetime is a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold with a general stationary axisymmetric metric, we calculate Cartan’s equation of structure and derive the Einstein tensor. In order to reduce the solving difficulty, we fix the gauge freedom to transform the metric into a more symmetric form. We solve the field equations in the two cases of the Ricci scalar\(R=0\)and\(R\ne 0\). In the case of\(R=0\), the Ernst’s equations are derived. We give the elementary solution of Ernst’s equations and show the way to obtain more solutions including Kerr metric. In the case of\(R\ne 0\), we reasonably assume that the solution to the equations consists of two parts: the first is Kerr part and the second is introduced by the Ricci scalar. Giving solution to the second part and combining the two parts, we obtain the Kerr-Ads metric. The calculations are carried out in a generalf(R) theory. Furthermore, the whole solving process can be treated as a standard calculation procedure to obtain rotating black holes, which can be applied to other modified gravities.
In this study, we investigate deviations from the Planck-\(\Lambda \)CDM model in the late universe (\(z \lesssim 2.5\)) using the Gaussian Processes method, with minimal assumptions. Our goal is to understand where exploring new physics in the late universe is most relevant. We analyze recent Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Type Ia Supernovae (SN), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. By examining reconstructions of the dimensionless parameter\(\delta (z)\), which measures deviations of the Hubble parameter from the Planck-\(\Lambda \)CDM predictions, we identify intriguing features at low (\(z \lesssim 0.5\)) and high (\(z \gtrsim 2\)) redshifts. Deviations from the Planck-\(\Lambda \)CDM model were not significant between\(0.5\lesssim z \lesssim 2\). Using the combined CC+SN+BAO dataset, we gain insights into dark energy (DE) dynamics, resembling characteristics of omnipotent DE, extending beyond quintessence and phantom models. DE exhibits n-quintessence traits for\(z\gtrsim 2\), transitioning with a singularity around\(z\sim 2\)to usual phantom traits in\(1\lesssim z\lesssim 2\). DE characteristics differ between scenarios (\(H_0\)-SH0ES and\(H_0\)-\(\Lambda \)&CMB), with\(H_0\)-SH0ES leaning towards phantom traits and\(H_0\)-\(\Lambda \)&CMB towards quintessence. We suggest exploring new physics at\(z\lesssim 0.5\)and\(1.5\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5\), particularly around\(z = 2\), to understand cosmological tensions such as\(H_0\)and\(S_8\).
The measurement of the flux of muons produced in cosmic ray air showers is essential for the study of primary cosmic rays. Such measurements are important in extensive air shower detectors to assess the energy spectrum and the chemical composition of the cosmic ray flux, complementary to the information provided by fluorescence detectors. Detailed simulations of the cosmic ray air showers are carried out, using codes such as CORSIKA, to estimate the muon flux at sea level. These simulations are based on the choice of hadronic interaction models, for which improvements have been implemented in the post-LHC era. In this work, a deficit in simulations that use state-of-the-art QCD models with respect to the measurement deep underwater with the KM3NeT neutrino detectors is reported. The KM3NeT/ARCA and KM3NeT/ORCA neutrino telescopes are sensitive to TeV muons originating mostly from primary cosmic rays with energies around 10 TeV. The predictions of state-of-the-art QCD models show that the deficit with respect to the data is constant in zenith angle; no dependency on the water overburden is observed. The observed deficit at a depth of several kilometres is compatible with the deficit seen in the comparison of the simulations and measurements at sea level.
In this paper, we construct a Dirac star model composed of\(|\kappa |\)pairs of spinor fields. The azimuthal harmonic indicesmof these spinor fields are half-integers, and they satisfy\(-(|\kappa |-\frac{1}{2})\le m \le |\kappa |-\frac{1}{2}\). When\(\kappa =1\), it corresponds to the conventional Dirac star model, formed by two spinor fields with\(m=\frac{1}{2}\)and\(m=-\frac{1}{2}\). When\(|\kappa |>1\), among these\(|\kappa |\)pairs of spinor fields, there exist spinor fields with azimuthal harmonic indices\(m>\frac{1}{2}\), and all spinor fields still conform to the same Dirac field equation. Different families of solutions are distinguished by the value of\(\kappa \), so we named these solutions\(\kappa \)-Dirac stars. We obtain solutions for\(\kappa =\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3,\pm 4,\pm 5,\pm 6\)by using numerical methods. Additionally, we compute their ADM massM, Noether chargeQ, and binding energyE, and illustrate how these quantities change with the spinor field’s frequency\(\omega \)for different\(\kappa \). We observe significant differences between solutions for\(|\kappa |>1\)and the\(|\kappa |=1\)case. Furthermore, we provide the energy density distribution of the Dirac stars, wherein for\(|\kappa |>1\)scenarios, the Dirac stars exhibit a spherical shell-like structure. Moreover, we employ three-dimensional diagrams to intuitively depict how\(\kappa \)influences the combination of spinor fields to form a spherically symmetric configuration.
Several potential subsurface openings have been observed on the surface of the Moon. These lunar pits are interesting in terms of science and for potential future habitation. However, it remains uncertain whether such pits provide access to cave conduits with extensive underground volumes. Here we analyse radar images of the Mare Tranquillitatis pit (MTP), an elliptical skylight with vertical or overhanging walls and a sloping pit floor that seems to extend further underground. The images were obtained by the Mini-RF instrument onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2010. We find that a portion of the radar reflections originating from the MTP can be attributed to a subsurface cave conduit tens of metres long, suggesting that the MTP leads to an accessible cave conduit beneath the Moon’s surface. This discovery suggests that the MTP is a promising site for a lunar base, as it offers shelter from the harsh surface environment and could support long-term human exploration of the Moon.
The concept of spacetime loses its usual interpretation at the essential singularity of a black hole. In consequence, all laws of physics must fail at this classical singularity. This unphysical behavior of spacetime at the singularity originates from general relativity. In order to have a consistent description of spacetime, this singularity must disappear in a quantum mechanical description of spacetime which is expected to be given by a quantum theory of gravity. In this paper, we therefore attempt to describe the quantum nature of spacetime in the vicinity of the (classical) singularity of a black hole. We take the Kantowsi–Sachs representation for the interior spacetime of a black hole and include inevitable vacuum fluctuations of matter field in the Klein–Gordon representation. Hence we obtain the Wheeler–DeWitt equation for the black hole interior and solve this equation exactly yielding a general expression for the interior wave function of the black hole. Admissible wave functions consistent with the DeWitt boundary condition implies that the Hilbert space has three nonoverlapping sectors distinguished by the relative character of the eigenvalues. Regular quantum black holes with admissible and well-behaved wave function having no singularity can exist only in two of those sectors. However, the remaining sector does not contain any regular quantum black hole.
We presentyadism, a library for the evaluation of both polarized and unpolarized deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) structure functions and cross sections up to N\(^{3}\)LO in perturbative QCD. The package provides computations of observables in fixed-flavor and zero-mass variable flavor number schemes. The implementation of the general mass variable flavor number schemes is supported through the high virtuality limits for the heavy flavor coefficients. In addition,yadismprovides a set of tools for the generation of interpolation grids in the PDF-independentPineAPPLformat, allowing to test the PDF dependence on any DIS observable without needing to rerun the computation. This work is part of an ongoing effort to standardize the format of theory predictions in high-energy physics within thepinelineframework. The code is open source, written inPythonand documented to facilitate usage, integrations, and further extensions. Finally, the code has been benchmarked against the widely usedAPFEL++andQCDNUMlibraries.
The continuous advancement of experimental techniques and investigations has led to observations of various exotic states in particle physics. Each addition to this family of states not only raises expectations for future discoveries but also focuses attention on such potential new states. Building upon this motivation and inspired by recent observations of various traditional and exotic particles containing an increased number of heavy quarks, our study provides a spectroscopic search for potential pentaquark states with spin-parity\(\frac{3}{2}^-\)and composed entirely of charm or bottom quarks. We predict the masses for full-charm and full-bottom pentaquark states as\(m = 7628 \pm 112\)MeV and\(m = 21,982 \pm 144\)MeV, respectively. We also compute the current couplings of these states to vacuum, which are main inputs in investigations of their various possible decays.
Hyperluminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs) are the rarest and most extreme starbursts and found only in the distant Universe (z≳ 1). They have intrinsic infrared (IR) luminositiesLIR≥ 1013L⊙and are commonly found to be major mergers. Recently, the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts project (PASSAGES) searched ~104deg2of the sky and found ~20 HyLIRGs. We describe a detailed study of PJ0116-24, the brightest (μLIR≈ 2.6 × 1014L⊙, magnified withμ≈ 17) Einstein-ring HyLIRG in the southern sky, atz= 2.125, with observations from the near-IR integral-field spectrograph VLT/ERIS and the submillimetre interferometer ALMA. We detected Hα, Hβ, [Nii] and [Sii] lines and obtained an extreme Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ ≈ 8.73 ± 1.14). We modelled the molecular-gas and ionized-gas kinematics with CO(3–2) and Hα data at ~100–300 pc and (sub)kiloparsec delensed scales, respectively, finding consistent regular rotation. We found PJ0116-24 to be highly rotationally supported (vrot/σ0, mol. gas≈ 9.4) with a richer gaseous substructure than other known HyLIRGs. Our results imply that PJ0116-24 is an intrinsically massive (Mbaryon≈ 1011.3M⊙) and rare starbursty disk (star-formation rate, SFR = 1,490M⊙yr−1) probably undergoing secular evolution. This indicates that the maximal SFR (≳1,000M⊙yr−1) predicted by simulations could occur during a galaxy’s secular evolution, away from major mergers.
Exploring variations in fundamental physics constants across cosmological space-time is of substantial importance in both theoretical and experimental physics. A crucial means of investigating such variations involves comparing laboratory measurements with astrophysical observations. In the present study, we employ a combination of laboratory data and observed Lyman transitions of\(H_2\)identified in the white dwarf star GD133. Through this examination, we find the temporal variation of the gravitational constant,\({{\dot{G}}}/{G} = (0.016 \pm 0.098) \times 10^{-15}~\text {year}^{-1}\)with a gravitational potential\(\phi \approx 10^4,\)and an average total redshift of\(H_2,\)\(z_{abs} =0.0001820(10).\)This newly determined constraint on the time variation ofGserves as an important tool for advancing discussions within unified theories.
In this work we focus on the effects of Starobinsky–Bel–Robinson (SBR) gravity parameter and external magnetic field on the motion of charged test particles and magnetic dipoles moving around a black hole in the selected gravity theory. We take the external magnetic field to be uniform and aligned along the axis of symmetry. Our results reveal that the effect of the SBR gravity parameter is very strong in the close environment of the central black hole while in the farther distances this effects diminishes very quickly. We see that the effect of the external magnetic field on the particle motion is always dominating over the SBR gravity parameter in farther distances. We show that for the motion of charged test particles the magnetic interaction can mimic the spin up to very rapid rotations for prograde motion of particles, while for the motion of magnetic dipoles magnetic interaction can mimic the spin completely for retrograde motion of such particles. We observe that in both scenarios, the SBR gravity parameter behaves as a weak mimicker of the spin of Kerr black hole. We apply the outcomes of our study to the scenario where a neutron star is assumed to behave as a magnetic dipole moving around the supermassive black hole Sgr\(A^\star \)to investigate how the magnetic field and the SBR gravity coupling parameter\(\beta \)affect the orbits of neutron stars orbiting the supermassive black hole.
Experimental High Energy Physics has entered an era of precision measurements. However, measurements of many of the accessible processes assume that the final states’ underlying kinematic distribution is the same as the Standard Model prediction. This assumption introduces an implicit model-dependency into the measurement, rendering the reinterpretation of the experimental analysis complicated without reanalysing the underlying data. We present a novel reweighting method in order to perform reinterpretation of particle physics measurements. It makes use of reweighting the Standard Model templates according to kinematic signal distributions of alternative theoretical models, prior to performing the statistical analysis. The generality of this method allows us to perform statistical inference in the space of theoretical parameters, assuming different kinematic distributions, according to a beyond Standard Model prediction. We implement our method as an extension to thepyhfsoftware and interface it with theEOSsoftware, which allows us to perform flavor physics phenomenology studies. Furthermore, we argue that, beyond thepyhforHistFactorylikelihood specification, only minimal information is necessary to make a likelihood model-agnostic and hence easily reinterpretable. We showcase that publishing such likelihoods is crucial for a full exploitation of experimental results.
In this work, we introduce a novel method for Particle Identification (PID) within the scope of the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Identifying products of ultrarelativisitc collisions delivered by the LHC is one of the crucial objectives of ALICE. Typically employed PID methods rely on hand-crafted selections, which compare experimental data to theoretical simulations. To improve the performance of the baseline methods, novel approaches use machine learning models that learn the proper assignment in a classification task. However, because of the various detection techniques used by different subdetectors, as well as the limited detector efficiency and acceptance, produced particles do not always yield signals in all of the ALICE components. This results in data with missing values. Out of the box machine learning solutions cannot be trained with such examples without either modifying the training dataset or re-designing the model architecture. In this work, we propose the new method for PID that addresses these issues and can be trained with all of the available data examples, including incomplete ones. Our approach improves the PID purity and efficiency of the selected sample for all investigated particle species.
The nature of the highly dense matter inside the supernova remnant compact star is not constrained by terrestrial experiments and hence modeled phenomenologically to accommodate the astrophysical observations from compact stars. The observable properties of the compact stars are highly sensitive to the microscopic model of highly dense matter. However, some universal relations exist between some macroscopic properties of compact stars independent of the matter model. We study the universal relation including the stars containing exotic degrees of freedom such as heavier strange and non-strange baryons, strange quark matter in normal and superconducting phases, etc. We examine the universal relations for quantities moment of inertia - tidal love number - quadrupole moment. We also study the correlation of non-radial f-mode and p-mode frequencies with stellar properties. We find the f-mode frequency observes the universal relation with dimensionless tidal deformability but the p-mode frequency does not show a good correlation with stellar properties. The p-mode frequency is sensitive to the composition of the matter. We find that universal relation is also applicable for stars with exotic matter in the core of the star with several models of exotic matter.
In the present work we study the geodesic motion and accretion process of a test particle near an Anti-de Sitter (ADS) BH surrounded by a dark fluid with a Chaplygin-like equation. Within the defined paradigm, we investigate on the equatorial plane and examine circular geodesics along with their features related to stabilities, radiation energy flux, oscillations and orbits. The general form of the fluid accretion onto the AdS BH through dynamical analysis and mass expansion also has discussed in a depth. Additionally, a few more interesting topics, e.g. the effective potential, angular momentum, specific energy, radiation energy and epicyclic frequencies have also been examined thoroughly. All the attributes are physically acceptable within the observational signatures and ranges.
Abstract—The results of creating a map of the circumpolar regions of the Moon are described. The maps are limited to latitudes +/–55° to show the location of theLuna-25landing. The article also provides a brief overview of space missions to the Moon.
AbstractThe Yarkovsky effect is one of the noticeable factors in the orbital evolution of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). The A2non-gravitational parameter describes the corresponding acceleration in the NEA motion model. This parameter can be derived from astrometric observations of the NEA. We present the results of astrometric observations of two NEAs (2010 XC15 and 2014 HK129). The measurements were performed with the MTM-500M telescope (Mountain Astronomical Station of the Pulkovo Observatory). The modified Gaia star apparent approach technique was applied. As a result, the astrometric accuracy of our observations reached the 0.05 arcsec level. It allowed us to estimate the A2values of the 2010 XC15 asteroid: –139.5 × 10–15± 20.2 × 10–15au/d2. It is in good agreement with the NASA JPL estimate for this asteroid. The 2014 HK129 A2parameter formal value extracted from our data is 61.3 × 10–15± 1583.4 × 10–15au/d2. Introduction of this A2value into the asteroid motion model provides a significant decrease (about 0.05–0.1 arcsec) of the (O–C) values for the first epoch of 2014 HK129 observations. It can be considered as faint evidence of the reality of Yarkovsky drift for the 2014 HK129 asteroid.
Abstract—A comparative study of impact glasses from the Lonar crater, located on the Deccan basalt plateau, India, and impact glasses from lunar regolith delivered by the Soviet automatic stations (AS)Luna-16andLuna-24(Sea of Plenty and Sea of Crises) was carried out. Numerous natural alloys (Cu3Ni2, Ni2Cu and Ni3Cu) that were previously unknown in nature were discovered in the impactites of the Lonar crater and the regolith of the Moon. The discovery of such alloys expands the area of isomorphism in the Cu–Ni system. As a result of a comparison of impactites of the Earth and the Moon, similarities were discovered in the composition, size and morphology of particles of copper–nickel alloys, which may be an indicator of impact processes. One of the possible mechanisms for the formation of Ni–Cu particles was condensation from a gas–plasma cloud. A possible source of material for Cu–Ni alloys was both the impactor material and the target material.
Abstract—A technique for joint use of positional and photometric measurements to determine the dynamic parameters of space debris (SD) objects is given. We present the results of its application to the assessment of the dynamic parameters of the motion of a group of objects in the geostationary area (GSA) based on observations made on the Zeiss-2000 telescope at the Terskol Observatory Center for Collective Use of the Institute of Astronomy of the Russian Academy of Sciences. We pay great attention to the problem of rejecting measurements, taking into account the specifics of presenting observations of SD objects. The determined parameters include the state vector of the object (coordinates and speed) at a given epoch, the value of the average object windage, the change in the area of its midsection and an approximate mass assessment.
Abstract7P/Pons–Winnecke is a near-Earth short-period comet of a moderate activity level. In this paper, we present the analysis of observations performed during a favorable apparition of the comet in 2021, indicating its status as a transitional ageing comet. The sublimation starts when the comet is close to the Sun, at a distance ofRON= 1.76 ± 0.1 AU, and continues for ~13 months, which is apparently caused by residual reserves of water ice. The dust production rate of the comet is not high even at perihelion (<150 kg/s), and the 1.4-percent active portion of the nucleus area is sufficient to provide this mass loss. The photometric age of the comet isPAGE= 54.4 comet years; being combined with a light curve amplitude ofASEC(1;1) = 5.5m, this age corresponds to the state of a transitional middle-aged comet.
AbstractMars has nearly ideal conditions for CO2dissociation by glow discharge plasmas. The directly generation of O2and CO on Mars was considered to be feasible and practical for in situ resource utilization of Martian atmosphere to get respirable O2and fuel. In this paper, we conduct several experiments under simulated Martian conditions to investigate the process and how the key parameters effect the generation of O2and CO in CO2glow discharge reactions. The yields of new products (i.e., O2and CO) under various gas discharge work parameters (i.e., discharge power, frequency, voltage, gap between the discharge plane electrodes and gas pressure) were systematically investigated. The reaction mechanism and reaction path of CO2glow discharge has been discussed. In our study the max yield of O2by CO2discharge dissociation was got about 21.8 g/h at 168 W which is very close to that of NASA MOXIE (Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment) at the same power. Our results showed the great potentiality of glow discharge for the practicable technology of O2and CO generation for in-situ resource utilization on Mars.
Abstract—Numerical modeling of the interaction of giant planets and the planetesimal disk was carried out for the Nice model, in which the initial orbits of the planets are in resonant configurations. In addition to the standard Nice model, planetesimals in the planetary region were considered and the self-gravity of the planetesimal disk was taken into account. The dynamic evolution of planetary systems has been studied over time intervals on the order of the lifetime of the Solar System. Options have been found in which planetary systems are preserved over billions of years, the final orbits of the planets are close to modern orbits and distant trans-Neptunian objects exist.
In spintronics, transverse anomalous transport properties have emerged as a highly promising avenue surpassing the conventional longitudinal transport behaviors. Here, we explore the transverse transport properties of monolayer and bilayer Fe3−xCoxGaTe2(x= 0.083, 0.167, 0.250, and 0.330) systems. All the systems exhibit ferromagnetic ground states with metallic features and also have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Besides, the magnetic anisotropy is substantially enhanced with increasing Co-doping concentration. However, unlike magnetic anisotropy, the Curie temperature is suppressed by increasing the Co-doping concentration. For instance, the monolayer and bilayer Fe2.917Co0.083GaTe2hold a Curie temperature of 253 K and 269 K, which decreases to 163 K and 173 K in monolayer and bilayer Fe2.67Co0.33GaTe2systems, respectively. We find a giant anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) of 6.03 A/(K·m) in the monolayer Fe2.917Co0.083GaTe2at −30 meV, and this is further enhanced to 11.30 A/(K·m) in the bilayer Fe2.917Co0.083GaTe2at −20 meV. Moreover, the bilayer Fe2.917Co0.083GaTe2structure has a large anomalous thermal Hall conductivity (ATHC) of −0.14 W/(K·m) at 100 K. Overall, we find that the Fe3−xCoxGaTe2(x= 0.083, 0.167, 0.250, and 0.330) structures have better anomalous transverse transport performance than the pristine Fe3GaTe2system and can be used for potential spintronics and spin caloritronics applications.
AbstractThe Chinese small body exploration mission Tianwen-2 is aimed at sampling the near-Earth, fast-rotating asteroid (469219) Kamo`oalewa and returning the samples to Earth. Characterisation of the currently unknown physical properties of Kamo`oalewa in the pre-mission phase would support mission implementation. In this study, we preliminarily estimate the surface thermal inertia of Kamo`oalewa using a statistical method, based on the Yarkovsky-related orbital drift of (–6.155 ± 1.758) × 10-3au/Myr for Kamo`oalewa obtained in our previous work. A reasonable estimate of the surface thermal inertia obtained is\(402.05_{{ - 194.37}}^{{ + 376.29}}\)J K–1m–2s–1/2. This low value suggests the presence of coarse regolith on the surface of Kamo`oalewa or its nature as a porous rock. The regolith potentially present on the surface of Kamo`oalewa may have millimetre- to decimetre-sized grains with cohesive strengths varying from ~0.76 to ~0.045 Pa. If Kamo`oalewa is a porous rock, its porosity is expected to range from ~20 to 50%, corresponding to tensile strengths of ~1.3 to 11.5 MPa. This study provides preliminary insights into the surface thermal inertia of Kamo`oalewa from a statistical viewpoint, which may facilitate the Tianwen-2 mission.
AbstractA three-axis seismic accelerometer was developed and created, containing three uniaxial mutually perpendicular sensors, the sensitivity axis of each sensor is located at an angle of 54.736° to the local gravitational vertical. For the first time, additional magnetic rigidity has been introduced into each device, allowing the device to be finely tuned to the conditions of a particular planet. However, the accumulated experience in conducting ground-based tests has shown the need to improve the uniaxial seismic accelerometer, which can significantly improve the characteristics of the device. First, we use a single material—beryllium bronze BrB-2—for the manufacture of massive test mass suspension elements with a thickness of 1.5 mm and an elastic element made of a thin strip 10–20 microns thick, which reduces the likelihood of instability. Secondly, we reduce the gap in the capacitors of capacitive converters from 0.25 to 0.1–0.15 mm to significantly increase the conversion slope of the capacitive sensor. Thirdly, we change the technology of setting up the device, for which we combine all the elements of the sensitive part of a uniaxial seismogravimeter using special vertical inserts. This allows us to place the device as a whole in a system for its configuration, eliminating the possibility of failure of individual elements, thereby increasing the reliability of the device.
Abstract—High temporal resolution of measurements of the magnetic field and plasma of Mars is provided by observations on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN; Jakosky et al., 2015) satellite, making it possible to analyze thin layers of the plasma envelope of Mars. This paper describes the magnetic structure associated with the daytime Martian magnetopause. It was shown that the solar wind passing through the shock wave on the dayside of Mars does not directly interact with the Martian ionosphere. A layer of plasma and magnetic field 200–300 km thick forms the daytime magnetosphere, which is the region between the magnetosheath and the ionosphere (Vaisberg and Shuvalov, 2020). There are two types of daytime magnetosphere: (1) the more common type of magnetosphere consists of heated and accelerated O+ions and\({\text{O}}_{2}^{ + }\), located between the ionosphere and the flowing hot stream of Mars; (2) another type of daytime magnetosphere consists of accelerated O+ions and\({\text{O}}_{2}^{ + }\)in the magnetosheath, where they form a continuing accelerated beam, forming a plume. Between the magnetosheath and the magnetosphere there is a magnetic structure that rotates, almost without changing its size. This structure is located in the second part of thenp/(np+nh) transition from ~1 to ~10–2. The transition between the magnetosheath and magnetosphere occurs smoothly, both in energy density and in ion composition, with a decrease in the proton flux and an increase in the heavy ion flux.
Abstract—The article provides a brief description of the Liulin-MO dosimeter, which is part of the FREND (Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector) device installed on theTGO(Trace Gas Orbiter) spacecraft of theExoMars-2016mission. Since April 2018,TGOhas been operating in orbit around Mars. Data are presented on the radiation environment in the orbit of Mars during the decline phase of the 24th cycle of solar activity and the growth phase of the 25th cycle. During the period under review, a maximum flux and dose rate due to galactic cosmic rays (GCR) were observed. Between July 2021 and March 2023, the Liulin-MO dosimeter recorded eight increases in particle fluxes and dose rates from solar proton events (SPEs). Data are presented on the radiation environment during the SPE in Mars orbit in July 2021–March 2022, when Mars was on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth. A comparison is made of particle fluxes measured in orbits around the Earth and Mars.
In this paper we have studied neutrino masses and mixings by adding a scalar triplet\(\eta \)to the particle content of minimal Inverse seesaw. We have realised this extension of minimal inverse seesaw with the help of a level 3 modular group,\(\Gamma (3)\). This group is isomorphic to non-abelian discrete symmetry group\(A_4\). We have also used\(Z_3\)symmetry group to restrain certain interaction terms in the lagrangian of the model. We have studied baryon asymmetry of the universe, neutrinoless double-beta decay and dark matter in our work. In order to check the consistency of our model with various experimental constraints, we have therefore calculated effective mass, relic density and baryogenesis via leptogenesis. Interestingly, we have found our model quite compatible with the experimental bounds and is also successful in producing the neutrino masses and mixings in the 3\(\sigma \)range.
Detecting axionic dark matter (DM) could be possible in an X-ray spectrum from strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs). We examine the possibility of axion–photon conversion in the magnetospheres of strongly magnetized NSs. In the current work, we investigate how the modified Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) system of equations (in the presence of a magnetic field) affects the energy spectrum of axions and axions-converted-photon flux. We have considered the distance-dependent magnetic field in the modified TOV system of equations. We employ three different equations of states (EoSs), namely APR, FPS, and SLY, to solve these equations. We obtain the axions emission rate by including the Cooper-pair-breaking formation process and Bremsstrahlung process in the core of NSs using the NSCool code. We primarily focus on Magnificient seven (M7) star RXJ 1856.5-3754. We further investigate the impact of the magnetic field on the actual observables, such as axion energy spectrum and axion-converted-photon flux at an axion mass in meV range by assuming mass\(M_{NS} \sim 1.4M_{\odot }.\)We compare our calculated axion-converted-photon flux from all available archival data sets from PN+MOS+Chandra. We also study the variation of the energy spectrum at a fixed energy with varying central magnetic fields. Our predicted axion-converted-photon flux values as a function of axion energy closely follow the experimentally archival data, which allows us to put bounds on the axion mass for the three EoS.
We study properties of the innermost photonsphere in the regular compact star background. We take the traceless energy–momentum tensor and dominant energy conditions. In the regular compact star background, we analytically obtain an upper bound on the radius of the innermost photonsphere as\(r_{\gamma }^{in}\leqslant \frac{12}{5}M,\)where\(r_{\gamma }^{in}\)is the radius of the innermost photonsphere andMis the total ADM mass of the asymptotically flat compact star spacetime.
We investigate the exclusive\(J/\psi \)production at the future Electron-ion collider in China by utilizing the eSTARlight event generator. We model the cross-section and kinematics by fitting to the world data of\(J/\psi \)photoproduction. Projected statistical uncertainties on\(J/\psi \)production are based on the design of a central detector, which consists of a tracker and vertex subsystem. The precision of the pseudo-data allows us to probe the near-threshold mechanism, e.g. the re-scattering effect. The significance of the forward amplitudes is discussed as well. The design and optimization of the detector enhance the potential for exploring the near-threshold region and the realm of high four-momentum transfer squared, which is of particular interest on several physics topics.
We investigate the strong gravitational lensing effects of various supermassive compact objects for the static and spherically symmetric hairy black hole by gravitational decoupling. To do this purpose, we first numerically calculate the strong deflection limit coefficients and strong deflection angle with the decoupling modified black hole parameter\(\alpha \)and\(\beta \). It is observed that for the lowest value of the parameter\(\alpha \), the strong deflection angle\(\alpha _D\)reaches its maximum value with the parameter\(\beta \)and for the lowest value of the parameter\(\beta \), strong deflection angle\(\alpha _D\)reaches its minimum value with the parameter\(\alpha \); and also the strong deflection angle for\(\alpha _D\)for the decoupling modified black hole is smaller than standard Schwarzschild black hole\((\alpha =0)\). We investigate the various astrophysical consequences via strong gravitational lensing by considering the example of various supermassive BHs in the centre nearby galaxies and observe that the decoupling modified black hole could be quantitatively distinguished from the standard Schwarzschild black hole (\(\alpha =0\)). Findings in our observation suggest that the observational test for a decoupling-modified black hole is indeed feasible.
For the first time, we reconstruct the dark energy equation of the state parameterwfrom the combination of background and perturbation observations, specifically combining the Hubble parameter data from cosmic chronometer observations and the logarithmic growth rate data from the growth rate observations. We do this analysis using posterior Gaussian process regression without considering any specific cosmological model or parametrization. However there are three main assumptions: (I) a flat Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric is considered for the cosmological background, (II) there is no interaction between dark energy and matter sectors, and (III) for the growth of inhomogeneity, sub-Hubble approximation and linear perturbations are considered. This study is unique in the sense that the reconstruction ofwis independent of any derived parameters such as the present values of the matter-energy density parameter and Hubble parameter. From the reconstruction, we look at how the dark energy equation of state evolves between redshifts 0 and 1.5, finding a slight hint of dynamical behavior in dark energy. However, the evidence is not significant. We also find a leaning towards non-phantom behavior over phantom behavior. We observe that the\(\varLambda \)CDM model\((w=-1)\)nearly touches the lower boundary of the 1\(\sigma \)confidence region in the redshift range\(0.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.85.\)However, it comfortably resides within the 2\(\sigma \)confidence region in the whole redshift range under investigation,\(0\le z \le 1.5.\)Consequently, the non-parametric, model-independent reconstruction of dark energy provides no compelling evidence to deviate from the\(\varLambda \)CDM model when considering cosmic chronometer and growth rate observations.
We study a model where the Standard Model is augmented with three sterile neutrinos. By adopting a particular parameterization of a\((6\times 6)\)unitary matrix—in this context, light neutrino masses being generated via a type-I seesaw mechanism—we analytically derive the masses of the sterile states using an exact seesaw relation. The masses of the sterile states are derived in terms of the lightest mass of active neutrinos and active–active and active–sterile mixing angles and phases; they can be all light, all heavy, or a mixture of light and heavy compared to the active states. This can be attributed to the interplay of theCP-violating (CPV) phases of the mixing matrix. As both active and sterile states can mediate the neutrinoless double beta decay (\(0\nu \beta \beta \)) process, their contributions to the effective mass of the electron neutrino,\(|m_{ee}|\), become a function of the mass of the lightest active state and active–active and active–sterile mixing angles and phases. We explore the parameter space of\(|m_{ee}|\), keeping in mind the present and future sensitivity of\(0\nu \beta \beta \)decay searches. By making use of constraints from charged lepton flavor-violating (cLFV) processes and non-unitarity, we explore the role of additional CPV phases and active–sterile mixing angle values. The numerical values thus obtained for\(|m_{ee}|\)can vary from as low as\(\mathscr {O}(10^{-4})\)to saturating the present experimental limit. We also check the reliability of our result by calculating the branching ratio of\(\mu \rightarrow e \gamma \), a prominent cLFV process, and non-unitarity in this framework.
Inspired by recent observations of\(T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^0\)in the\(D_s^+ \pi ^-\)invariant mass distribution of\(B^0 \rightarrow \bar{D}^0 D_s^+ \pi ^-\)decay and\(T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++}\)in the\(D_s^+ \pi ^+\)invariant mass distribution of\(B^+ \rightarrow D^- D_s^+ \pi ^+\)decay, we investigate the\(T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++}\)contribution to the\(B^+ \rightarrow K^+ D^+ D^-\)decay in a molecular scenario, where we consider\(T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++}\)as a\(D^{*+} K^{*+}\)molecular state. Our estimations indicate that the fit fraction of\(T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++}\)in the\(B^+ \rightarrow K^+ D^+ D^-\)is about\(13\%\), and its signal is visible in the\(D^+ K^+\)invariant mass distribution. With the involvement of\(T_{c\bar{s}0}(2900)^{++}\), the fit fractions of\(\chi _{c0}(3915)\)and\(\chi _{c2}(3930)\)may be much different with the ones obtained by the amplitude analysis in Ref. [Aaij et al. Phys. Rev. D 102:112003, 2020], which may shed light on the long standing puzzle of\(\chi _{c0}(3915)\)as the conventional charmonium.
Inspired by string T-duality and taking into account the zero-point length correction,\(l_0\), to the gravitational potential, we construct modified Friedmann equations by applying the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon of the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) Universe. The cosmological viability of this extended scenario is investigated by studying influences on the evolution of the early Universe and performing cosmographic analysis. Furthermore, we explore the inflationary paradigm under the slow-roll condition. By testing the model against observational data, the zero-point length is constrained around the Planck scale, in compliance with the original assumption from string T-duality. We also study the growth of density perturbations in the linear regime. It is shown that the zero-point length stands out as an alternative characterization for the broken-power-law spectrum, providing a better fit for the experimental measurements than the simple power-law potential. Finally, we focus on implications for the primordial gravitational wave (PGW) spectrum. Should the zero-point length be running over energy scales, as is the case for all parameters and coupling constants in quantum gravity under renormalization group considerations, deviations from general relativity (GR) might be potentially tested through upcoming PGW observatories.
Observing exoplanets through transmission spectroscopy supplies detailed information about their atmospheric composition, physics and chemistry. Before the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), these observations were limited to a narrow wavelength range across the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared, alongside broadband photometry at longer wavelengths. To understand more complex properties of exoplanet atmospheres, improved wavelength coverage and resolution are necessary to robustly quantify the influence of a broader range of absorbing molecular species. Here we present a combined analysis of JWST transmission spectroscopy across four different instrumental modes spanning 0.5–5.2 μm using Early Release Science observations of the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39 b. Our uniform analysis constrains the orbital and stellar parameters within subpercentage precision, including matching the precision obtained by the most precise asteroseismology measurements of stellar density to date, and it further confirms the presence of Na, K, H2O, CO, CO2and SO2as atmospheric absorbers. Through this process, we have improved the agreement between the transmission spectra of all modes, except for the NIRSpec PRISM, which is affected by partial saturation of the detector. This work provides strong evidence that uniform light curve analysis is an important aspect to ensuring reliability when comparing the high-precision transmission spectra provided by JWST.
We investigate the temperature-dependent production of feebly interacting massive dark matter particle (FIMP DM) within a\(Z_2\)model, incorporating two\(Z_2\)-odd scalar fields. In specific parameter regions, three distinct mechanisms individually dominate the production of the FIMP DM. These mechanisms include the semi-production process, commonly known as the “exponential growth” process, the three-body decay process, and the production from pair annihilations of the bath particles. It is crucial to consider the thermal history during the evolution of FIMPs, as it involves multiple phase transitions occurring prior to the freeze-in of dark matter. Consequently, the scalar masses experience thermal variations, leading to distinctive evolutionary trajectories for FIMPs when compared to scenarios without accounting for the thermal effects. Notably, the unique patterns of FIMP evolution are accompanied by the production of gravitational waves, presenting promising opportunities for detection using forthcoming interferometers.
We investigate the tachyonic instability of Kerr–Newman (KN) black hole with a rotation parameterain the Einstein–Chern–Simons-scalar theory coupled with a quadratic massive scalar field. This instability analysis corresponds to exploring the onset of spontaneous scalarization for KN black holes. First, we find noa-bound for\(\alpha <0\)case by considering (1 + 1)-dimensional analytical method. A direct numerical method is adopted to explore (2 + 1)-dimensional time evolution of a massive scalar perturbation with positive and negative\(\alpha \)to obtain threshold curves numerically. We obtain threshold curves\(\alpha _{\textrm{th}}(a)\)of tachyonic instability for positive\(\alpha \)without anya-bounds. We expect to find the same threshold curves\(\alpha _{\textrm{th}}(a)\)of tachyonic instability for negative\(\alpha \)without anya-bound because its linearized scalar theory is invariant under the transformation of\(\alpha \rightarrow -\alpha \)and\(\theta \rightarrow -\theta .\)In addition, it is found that the scalar mass term suppresses tachyonic instability of KN black holes, while the black hole charge promotes the instability (disregarding the contribution of the charge to the existence conditions\(M^2-Q^2\ge a^2)\).
In this work we characterize all the static and spherically symmetric vacuum solutions inf(R) gravity when the principal null directions of the Weyl tensor are non-expanding. In contrast to General Relativity, we show that the Nariai spacetime is not the only solution of this type when generalf(R) theories are considered. In particular, we find four different solutions for the non-constant Ricci scalar case, all of them corresponding to the same theory, given by\(f(R) = r_0^{-1}\left|R-3/r_0^2\right|^{1/2}\), where\(r_0\)is a non-null constant. Finally, we briefly present some geometric properties of these solutions.
The excellent experimental prospects to measure the invisible mass spectrum of the\(K^+\rightarrow \pi ^+\nu {\bar{\nu }}\)decay opens a new path to test generalised quark–neutrino interactions with flavour changing\(s\rightarrow d\)transitions and as such to novel probes of Physics beyond the Standard Model. Such signals can be a consequence of new lepton-number violating or lepton-number conserving interactions, with their interpretations depending on the Majorana versus Dirac nature of the neutrinos. Furthermore, the possible existence of new massive sterile neutrinos can be tested via their distinctive imprints in the invariant mass spectrum. Within the model-independent framework of the weak effective theory at dimension-six, we study the New Physics effects of Majorana and Dirac neutrinos on the differential distribution of\(K^+\rightarrow \pi ^+\nu {\bar{\nu }}\)allowing for lepton-number violating interactions and potential new sterile neutrinos. We determine the current and expected future sensitivity on the corresponding\(\Delta S=1\)neutral-current Wilson coefficients using the distribution measured by the NA62 collaboration and accounting for expected improvements based on the HIKE experiment. We present single-operator fits and also determine correlations among different type of operators. Even though we focus on\(s\rightarrow d\nu \nu \)transitions, the operator bases for Majorana and Dirac and the classification of lepton-number-violating/conserving interactions is applicable also for the study of\(b\rightarrow s/d\nu \nu \)and\(c\rightarrow u\nu \nu \)transitions relevant in current phenomenology.
In AdS/CFT, partition functions of decoupled CFTs living on separate asymptotic boundaries factorize. However, the presence of bulk wormholes connecting different boundaries tends to spoil the factorization of the bulk partition function, which leads to a disagreement between the two sides. In this paper, we present two examples where wormhole contributions cancel each other in bulk partition function calculations, thus the bulk factorization can be realized. The first example is in 2-dimensional Jackiw–Teitelboim (JT) gravity, where the proposed way of realizing the cancellation resides in the extra complex phases associated with different wormholes. The phases arise due to the degenerate vacua structure. In the example of the Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) model, the cancellation can be achieved due to the distribution of the wormhole saddles on a complex plane. The two examples demonstrate a way of realizing bulk partition function factorization by extending the Hilbert space and dressing wormhole saddles with extra phases.
We explicitly construct the analogue of the d’Alembert solution to the 1+1 wave equation in an hyperboloidal setting. This hyperboloidal d’Alembert solution is used, in turn, to gain intuition into the behaviour of solutions to the wave equation in a hyperboloidal foliation and to explain an apparently anomalous permanent displacement of the solution in numerical simulations discussed in the literature.
To date, the four-gluon vertex is the least explored component of the QCD Lagrangian, mainly due to the vast proliferation of Lorentz and color structures required for its description. In this work we present a nonperturbative study of this vertex, based on the one-loop dressed Schwinger–Dyson equation obtained from the 4PI effective action. A vast simplification is brought about by resorting to “collinear” kinematics, where all momenta are parallel to each other, and by appealing to the charge conjugation symmetry in order to eliminate certain color structures. Out of the fifteen form factors that comprise the transversely-projected version of this vertex, two are singled out and studied in detail; the one associated with the classical tensorial structure is moderately suppressed in the infrared regime, while the other diverges logarithmically at the origin. Quite interestingly, both form factors display the property known as “planar degeneracy” at a rather high level of accuracy. With these results we construct an effective charge that quantifies the strength of the four-gluon interaction, and compare it with other vertex-derived charges from the gauge sector of QCD.
Centaurs are transitional objects between primitive trans-Neptunian objects and Jupiter-family comets. Their compositions and activities provide fundamental clues regarding the processes affecting the evolution of and interplay between these small bodies. Here we report observations of centaur 29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann 1 (29P) with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We identified localized jets with heterogeneous compositions driving the outgassing activity. We employed the NIRSpec mapping spectrometer to study the fluorescence emissions of CO and obtain a definitive detection of CO2for this target. The exquisite sensitivity of the instrument also enabled carbon and oxygen isotopic signatures to be probed. Molecular maps reveal complex outgassing distributions, such as jets and anisotropic morphology, which indicate that 29P’s nucleus is dominated by active regions with heterogeneous compositions. These distributions could reflect that it has a bilobate structure with compositionally distinct components or that strong differential erosion takes place on the nucleus. As there are no missions currently planning to visit a centaur, these observations demonstrate JWST’s unique capabilities in characterizing these objects.
In spring 1949 about 70 physicists from eight countries met in Florence to discuss recent trends in statistical mechanics. This scientific gathering, co-organized by the Commission on Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) and the Italian Physical Society (SIF), initiated a tradition of IUPAP-sponsored international conferences on statistical mechanics that lasts to this day. In 1977, when this conference series took the name of StatPhys, the foundational role of the Florence conference was recognized by retrospectively naming it StatPhys1. This paper examines the dual scientific and social significance of the conference, situating it in the broader contexts of the post-World War II reconstruction in Italian physics and of the revitalization of the international science organization. Through an analysis of IUPAP archives and Italian records, we illustrate how the event’s success hinged on the aligned objectives of its organizers. Internationally, it was instrumental in defining the scientific and organizational foundations for the activities of IUPAP commissions during a critical phase of IUPAP’s history, when the Union was resurging on the international scene after the inactivity of the interwar period. Nationally, the conference served as a cornerstone in SIF’s strategy to re-establish Italian physics’ international stature and to aid the domestic revitalization of physics through the internationalization of its activities, notably of its flagship journal,Il Nuovo Cimento. This analysis not only sheds light on the conference’s impact but also informs recent discussions in the history of science about the multiple roles of international scientific conferences.
We explore the impact of the chameleon mechanism in scalar field Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet gravity on the dynamics of cosmological parameters. Conducting a thorough analysis of the phase space, we identify conditions under which the future attractor does not depict a singular universe. Our conclusion is that although Einstein–Gauss–Bonnet scalar field gravity offers an inflationary solution as a future attractor, it is unable to account for the late-time acceleration of the universe and it can not describe a universe similar to that provide by the\(\Lambda \)CDM model. On the other hand, when the matter source is described by a massless scalar field, then the de Sitter universe is a future attractor. However, the hyperbolic inflationary solution provided by the two scalar fields does not exist.
Heavy quarks, produced at early stages of heavy-ion collisions, are an excellent probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) also created in these collisions. Electrons from open heavy-flavor hadron decays (HFE) are good proxies for heavy quarks, and have been measured extensively in the last two decades to study QGP properties. These measurements are traditionally carried out by subtracting all known background sources from the inclusive electron sample. More recently, a significant enhancement of\(e^+e^-\)pair production at very low transverse momenta was observed in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. The production characteristics is consistent with coherent photon–photon interactions, which should also constitute a background source to the HFE measurements. In this article, we provide theoretical predictions for the contribution of coherent electron production to HFEs as a function of transverse momentum, centrality and collision energy in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions.
This study explores the behavior of compact stars within the framework of\(f(R,L_m,T)\)gravity, focusing on the functional form\(f(R,L_m,T) = R + \alpha TL_m\). The modified Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) equations are derived and numerically solved for several values of the free parameter\(\alpha \)by considering both quark and hadronic matter—described by realistic equations of state (EoSs). Furthermore, the stellar structure equations are adapted for two different choices of the matter Lagrangian density (namely,\(L_m= p\)and\(L_m= -\rho \)), laying the groundwork for our numerical analysis. As expected, we recover the traditional TOV equations in General Relativity (GR) when\(\alpha \rightarrow 0\). Remarkably, we found that the two choices for\(L_m\)have appreciably different effects on the mass-radius diagrams. Results showcase the impact of\(\alpha \)on compact star properties, while final remarks summarize key findings and discuss implications, including compatibility with observational data from NGC 6397’s neutron star. Overall, this research enhances comprehension of\(f(R,L_m,T)\)gravity’s effects on compact star internal structures, offering insights for future investigations.
We study the quantumness of gravitational cat states in correlated dephasing channels. Our focus is on exploring how classical correlations between successive actions of a dephasing channel influence the decoherence of two gravitational cats (two qubits) at a thermal regime. The results show that the quantum coherence, local quantum Fisher information, and Bell non-locality can be significantly enhanced by augmenting classical correlations throughout the entire duration when the two qubits pass the channel. However, the gravitational interaction and energy gap between states exhibit intricate impacts on the quantum characteristics of gravitational cats. New features are reported that can be significant for both gravitational physics and quantum information processing.
In this manuscript, we illustrate how to use the newly proposed\(\tau \)re-clustering algorithm to select jets with different degrees of quenching without biasing their initial transverse momentum spectrum. Our study is based on Z+jet simulated events using the JEWEL Monte Carlo event generator to account for jet quenching effects. We apply the\(\tau \)re-clustering algorithm to extract a proxy for a time axis (formation time) within the evolving medium. This information allows us to label jets according to their fragmentation pattern and select populations with enhanced sensitivity to quenching effects. Our results illustrate the potential of jets as precision tools for QGP tomography. Further, we show that the discussed method minimizes the biases stemming from\(p_{T}\)-,\(\Delta R\)- or mass-based jet selection.
We investigate the non-Gaussian effects of the Saha equation in Rindler space via Tsallis statistics. By considering a system with cylindrical geometry, we deduce the non-Gaussian Saha ionization equation for a partially ionized hydrogen plasma that expands with uniform acceleration. We demonstrate conditions for the validity of the equivalence principle within the realms of both Boltzmann–Gibbs and Tsallis statistics. In the non-Gaussian framework, our findings reveal that the effective binding energy exhibits a quadratic dependence on the frame acceleration, in contrast to the linear dependence predicted by Boltzmann–Gibbs statistics. We show that an accelerated observer shall notice a more pronounced effect on the effective binding energy for\(a>0\)and a more attenuated one when\(a<0\). We also ascertain that an accelerated observer will measure values ofqsmaller than those measured in the rest frame. Besides, assuming the equivalence principle, we examine the effects of the gravitational field on the photoionization of hydrogen atoms and pair production. We show that both photoionization and pair production are more intensely suppressed in regions with a strong gravitational field in a non-Gaussian context than in the Boltzmann–Gibbs framework. Lastly, constraints on the gravitational field and the electron and positron chemical potentials are derived.
The present work deals with a FLRW cosmological model with spatial curvature and minimally coupled scalar field as the matter content. The curvature term behaves as a perfect fluid with the equation of state parameter\(\omega _{\mathcal {K}}=-\frac{1}{3}\). Using suitable transformation of variables, the evolution equations are reduced to an autonomous system for both power law and exponential form of the scalar potential. The critical points are analyzed with center manifold theory and stability has been discussed. Also, critical points at infinity have been studied using the notion of Poincaré sphere. Finally, the cosmological implications of the critical points and cosmological bouncing scenarios are discussed. It is found that the cosmological bounce takes place near the points at infinity when the non-isolated critical points on the equator of the Poincaré sphere are saddle or saddle-node in nature.
This work deals with the presence of localized static structures in the real line, described by relativistic real scalar fields in two spacetime dimensions. We consider models featuring both standard and modified kinematics, where we employ two intriguing potentials supporting defect solutions. The first potential can transform kink into compacton in the standard framework, while the second one is based on the inflationary Starobinsky model. Interesting possibilities unseen in previous investigations are described, in particular, for the case related to the Starobinsky potential. The addressed potentials are inserted into a broader framework, and so the extended models are described by a wider set of solutions. This investigation also reveals the presence of the twinlike behaviour for a specific compact configuration, which solves two distinct models.
In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, multi-messenger GW observation for binary neutron star (BNS) merger events can exert great impacts on exploring cosmic expansion history. In this work, we comprehensively explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations by considering 3G GW detectors and the future short\(\gamma \)-ray burst (GRB) detector THESEUS-like telescope joint observations. Based on a 10-year observation of different detection strategies, we predict that the numbers of detectable GW-GRB events are 334–674 with the redshifts\(z<3.5\)and the inclination angles\(\iota <15^{\circ }\). For the cosmological analysis, we consider the\(\Lambda \)CDM,wCDM,\(w_0w_a\)CDM, and interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We find that GW can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with precision of 0.345–0.065%, but does not perform well in constraining other cosmological parameters. Fortunately, GW detection could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB + BAO + SN (CBS). When combining mock GW data with CBS data, CBS + GW can tightly constrain the equation of state of dark energywwith a precision of 1.26%, close to the standard of precision cosmology. Meanwhile, the addition of GW to CBS could improve constraints on cosmological parameters by 34.2–94.9%. In conclusion, GW standard siren observations from 3G GW detectors could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.
In this study, we explore the accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of modifiedf(Q) gravity. The investigation focus on the role of bulk viscosity in understanding the universe’s accelerated expansion. Specifically, a bulk viscous matter-dominated cosmological model is considered, with the bulk viscosity coefficient expressed as\(\zeta = \zeta _0 \rho H^{-1} + \zeta _1 H \). We consider the power lawf(Q) function\(f(Q)=\alpha Q^n \), where\(\alpha \)andnare arbitrary constants and derive the analytical solutions for the field equations corresponding to a flat FLRW metric. Subsequently, we used the combined Cosmic Chronometers (CC)+Pantheon+SH0ES sample to estimate the free parameters of the obtained analytic solution. We conduct Bayesian statistical analysis to estimate the posterior probability by employing the likelihood function and the MCMC random sampling technique, along with the AIC and BIC statistical assessment criteria. In addition, we explore the evolutionary behavior of significant cosmological parameters. The effective equation of state (EOS) parameter predicts the accelerating behavior of the cosmic expansion phase. Further, by the statefinder andOm(z) diagnostic test, we found that our viscous model favors quintessence-type behavior and can successfully describe the late-time scenario.
The center-of-mass energy of two colliding particles could be arbitrarily high in the vicinity of event horizons of the extremal Myers-Perry black holes if the angular momentum of colliding particles is fine-tuned to the critical values. We investigate the maximum efficiency of two colliding particles in four and six dimensions. The efficiency of collision for two particles near the four-dimensional Kerr black holes is 130%. We show that the efficiency increases to 145% for collision in six dimensions. We also show that the region for the polar angle in which the particle can reach the high energy is larger when the dimension of space-time increases.
We perform a global analysis of the bounds from charged lepton flavour violating observables to new physics. We parametrize generic new physics through the effective field theory formalism and perform global fits beyond the common one-operator-at-a-time analyses to investigate how much present data is able to constrain the full parameter space. We particularly focus on leptonic and semileptonic operators with light quarks, identifying unbounded flat directions, detailing how many are present and which operators are involved. The analysis is performed in the general LEFT formalism, which contains all possible low-energy effective operators relevant for lepton flavour violation, as well as in more restricted scenarios, when operators come from a SMEFT completion. We find that flat directions play no role in the fully leptonic four-fermion operators. Conversely, they significantly hinder the ability to derive global bounds on semileptonic operators, with several flat or at least very poorly constrained directions preventing to fully constrain the parameter space. These results are particularly affected by the proper inclusion of uncertainties in the parameters describing\(\mu -e\)conversion, which decrease the number of well-constrained directions in operator space when treated as nuisance parameters in the fit. While present data is able to provide global constraints on all operators only in the more restricted scenarios we investigated, very strong correlations among the parameters must exist to avoid conflict with the different observables. We provide correlation matrices approximating our full results as a useful tool to compare present data with particular UV completions.
In this study, we investigate signature flips within the framework of cosmological models featuring a time-varying vacuum energy term\(\Lambda (t)\). Specifically, we consider the power-law form of\(\Lambda =\alpha H^n\), where\(\alpha \)andnare constants. To constrain the model parameters, we use the MCMC technique, allowing for effective exploration of the model’s parameters. We apply this approach to analyze 31 points of observational Hubble Data (OHD), 1048 points from the Pantheon data, and additional CMB data. We consider three scenarios: whennis a free parameter (Case I), when\(n=0\)(Case II), and when\(n=1\)(Case III). In our analysis across all three cases, we observe that our model portrays the universe’s evolution from a matter-dominated decelerated epoch to an accelerated epoch, as indicated by the corresponding deceleration parameter. In addition, we investigate the physical behavior of total energy density, total EoS parameter, and jerk parameter. Our findings consistently indicate that all cosmological parameters predict an accelerated expansion phase of the universe for all three cases (\(q_0<0\),\(\omega _0<-\frac{1}{3}\),\(j_0>0\)). Furthermore, our analysis reveals that theOm(z) diagnostics for Cases I and III align with the quintessence region, while Case II corresponds to the\(\Lambda \)CDM model.
Previously we showed that nearly extremal Bañados–Teitelboim–Zanelli (BTZ) black holes can be overspun by test bodies and fields, following the work of Rocha and Cardoso for the extremal case. The naked singularities in AdS space-times correspond to states rotating faster than light in the Ads/CFT correspondence. Therefore, overspinning turns out to be a drastic problem in a (2 + 1) dimensional AdS space-time, where one cannot invoke backreaction effects. Here, we consider the induced increase in the angular velocity of the event horizon which modifies the condition to allow the absorption of the perturbations satisfying the null energy condition. We show that its magnitude is sufficiently large to prevent the absorption of the challenging modes both for test bodies and scalar fields. We bring a solution to the notorious overspinning problem which does not involve any reference to self-energy or gravitational radiation
In this paper we found the multiplicity distribution of the produced gluons in deep inelastic scattering at large\(z=\ln \left( Q^2_s/Q^2\right) \,\,\gg \,\,1\)where\( Q_s \)is the saturation momentum and\(Q^2\)is the photon virtuality. It turns out that this distribution at large\(n > \bar{n}\)almost reproduces the KNO scaling behaviour with the average number of gluons\( \bar{n} \propto \exp \left( z^2/2 \kappa \right) \), where\(\kappa = 4.88 \)in the leading order of perturbative QCD. The KNO function\(\Psi \left( \frac{n}{\bar{n}}\right) = \exp \left( -\,n/\bar{n}\right) \). For\(n < \bar{n}\)we found that\(\sigma _n \propto \Big ( z - \sqrt{2 \,\kappa \,\ln (n-1)}\Big )/(n-1)\). Such smallndetermine the value of entropy of produced gluons\(S_E = 0.3\, z^2/(2\,\kappa )\)at largez. The factor 0.3 stems from the non-perturbative corrections that provide the correct behaviour of the saturation momentum at largeb.
SuperWIMPs are extremely weakly interacting massive particles that inherit their relic abundance from late decays of frozen-out parent particles. Within supersymmetric models, gravitinos and axinos represent two of the most well motivated superWIMPs. In this paper we revisit constraints on these scenarios from a variety of cosmological observations that probe their production mechanisms as well as the superWIMP kinematic properties in the early Universe. We consider in particular observables of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background (spectral distortion and anisotropies), which limit the fractional energy injection from the late decays, as well as warm and mixed dark matter constraints derived from the Lyman-\(\alpha \)forest and other small-scale structure observables. We discuss complementary constraints from collider experiments, and argue that cosmological considerations rule out a significant part of the gravitino and the axino superWIMP parameter space.
Ascertaining the morphology and composition of the icy mantles covering dust grains in dense, cold regions of the interstellar medium is essential to developing accurate astrochemical models, determining conditions for ice formation, constraining chemical interactions in and on icy grains and understanding how ices withstand space radiation. The widely observed infrared spectroscopic signature of H2O ice at ~3 μm discriminates crystalline from amorphous structures in interstellar ices. Weaker bands seen only in laboratory ice spectra at ~2.7 μm, termed ‘dangling OH’ (dOH), are attributed to water molecules not fully bound to neighbouring water molecules and are often considered as tracing the degree of ice compaction. We exploit the high sensitivity of JWST NIRCam to detect two dOH features at 2.703 and 2.753 μm along multiple lines of sight probing the dense cloud Chamaeleon I, attributing these signatures to unbound dOH in cold water ice and dOH in interaction with other molecular species. These detections open a path to using the dOH features as tracers of the formation, composition, morphology and evolution of icy grains during the star and planet formation process.
We elaborate on a model of nonassociative and noncommutative Einstein–Dirac–Maxwell, EDM, theory determined by star product R-flux deformations in string theory. Solutions for nonassociative EDM systems and physical properties not studied in modern physics. For modifications of the four-dimensional, 4-d, Einstein gravity, we work on conventional nonassociative 8-d phase spaces modelled as star-deformed co-tangent Lorentz bundles. Generalizing the anholonomic frame and connection deformation method, the nonassociative EDM equations are decoupled and integrated in exact and parametric quasi-stationary forms. Corresponding generic off-diagonal metrics are described by nonlinear symmetries and encode nonassociative effective sources and generating functions depending on space and momentum-like coordinates. For respective nonholonomic parameterizations, such solutions describe nonassociative deformations of the Reissner–Nordström black holes. A variant of nonassociative phase space wormhole solution with fermions possessing anisotropic polarized masses is also analyzed. We conclude that such phase space physical objects can’t be characterized using the concept of Bekenstein–Hawking entropy and show how to compute another type (modified G. Perelman ones) nonassociative geometric and statistical thermodynamic variables.
We search for a redshift dependence of\(\sigma _8^0\)using 23 growth rate measurements from redshift space distortions and peculiar velocity measurements as a consistency check of\(\Lambda \)CDM. For this purpose we use the dataset from Sagredo et al. (Phys Rev D 98:083543, 2018) consisting of 22 measurements, which has been vetted for internal consistencies. Eighteen of these measurements have been obtained from the Gold-2017 sample, collated from multiple redshift space distortion surveys between 2009 and 2016, whereas the remaining four have been obtained from the eBOSS DR14 quasar survey. We also added one additional data point from the BOSS DR12 CMASS galaxy sample. We find that for this dataset the\(\sigma _8^0\)values are consistent between the low redshift and high redshift samples using three different redshift cuts. This implies that the growth rate measurements are consistent with a constant\(\sigma _8^0\)in accord with\(\Lambda \)CDM, assuming there are no uncontrolled systematics in this dataset.
Modern particle physics experiments usually rely on highly complex and large-scale spectrometer devices. In high energy physics experiments, visualization helps detector design, data quality monitoring, offline data processing, and has great potential for improving physics analysis. In addition to the traditional physics data analysis based on statistical methods, visualization provides unique intuitive advantages in searching for rare signal events and reducing background noises. By applying the event display tool to several physics analyses in the BESIII experiment, we demonstrate that visualization can benefit potential physics discovery and improve the signal significance. With the development of modern visualization techniques, it is expected to play a more important role in future data processing and physics analysis of particle physics experiments.
We extend the existing leading (LO), next-to-leading (NLO), and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) NNPDF4.0 sets of parton distribution functions (PDFs) to approximate next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (\(\hbox {aN}^3\hbox {LO}\)). We construct an approximation to the\(\hbox {N}^3\hbox {LO}\)splitting functions that includes all available partial information from both fixed-order computations and from small and largexresummation, and estimate the uncertainty on this approximation by varying the set of basis functions used to construct the approximation. We include known\(\hbox {N}^3\hbox {LO}\)corrections to deep-inelastic scattering structure functions and extend the FONLL general-mass scheme to\(\mathcal {O}\left( \alpha _s^3\right) \)accuracy. We determine a set of\(\hbox {aN}^3\hbox {LO}\)PDFs by accounting both for the uncertainty on splitting functions due to the incomplete knowledge of\(\hbox {N}^3\hbox {LO}\)terms, and to the uncertainty related to missing higher corrections (MHOU), estimated by scale variation, through a theory covariance matrix formalism. We assess the perturbative stability of the resulting PDFs, we study the impact of MHOUs on them, and we compare our results to the\(\hbox {aN}^3\hbox {LO}\)PDFs from the MSHT group. We examine the phenomenological impact of\(\hbox {aN}^3\hbox {LO}\)corrections on parton luminosities at the LHC, and give a first assessment of the impact of\(\hbox {aN}^3\hbox {LO}\)PDFs on the Higgs and Drell–Yan total production cross-sections. We find that the\(\hbox {aN}^3\hbox {LO}\)NNPDF4.0 PDFs are consistent within uncertainties with their NNLO counterparts, that they improve the description of the global dataset and the perturbative convergence of Higgs and Drell–Yan cross-sections, and that MHOUs on PDFs decrease substantially with the increase of perturbative order.
Gravitational plane waves (when Ricci flat) belong to the VSI family. The achronym VSI stands forvanishing scalar invariants, meaning that all scalar invariants built out of Riemann tensor and its derivatives vanish, although the Riemann tensor itself does not. In the particular case of plane waves many interesting phenomena have been uncovered for strings propagating in this background. Here we comment on gravitons propagating in such a spacetime.
We investigate a flat emergent universe (EU) with a nonlinear equation of state equivalent to three different composition of fluids. In the EU initially, the evolution of the universe began with no interaction but as time evolves an interaction sets in among the three fluids leading to the observed universe. The characteristic of an EU is that it is a singularity free universe that evolves with all the basic features of the early evolution. For a given nonlinear equation of state parameter, it permits a universe with three different fluids, we get a universe with dark energy, cosmic string, and radiation domination to begin with which at a later epoch transits into a universe with three different fluids with matter domination (baryonic as well as dark matter) and dark energy for a given interaction strength among the cosmic fluids. The evolution of the universe is probed with exponential interactions to obtain a universe with late acceleration. The model parameters are constrained using the observed Hubble data and Type Ia Supernova (SnIa) data from the Pantheon data set. An interacting EU transforms to a matter dominated phase with DE accommodating the present universe satisfactorily. The stability of the cosmological model is also discussed.
The emerging nonvolatile memory, three-dimensional vertical resistive random-access memory (VRRAM), inspired by the vertical NAND structure, has been proposed to replace NAND flash memory which has reached its integration limit. To improve the vertical ionic diffusion occurring in the conventional VRRAM structure, we propose a Pt/HfO2/TiO2/Ti self-aligned VRRAM with physically confined switching cells through sidewall thermal oxidation. We achieved stable bipolar switching, endurance (>104cycles), and retention (>104s) responses, and improved the interlayer leakage current issue through a distinctive self-aligned structure. Additionally, we elucidated the switching mechanism by analyzing current levels concerning ambient temperature. To utilize VRRAM for neuromorphic computing, the biological synaptic functions are emulated by applying pulse stimulation to the synaptic cell. The weight modulation of biological synapses is demonstrated based on potentiation, depression, spike-rate-dependent plasticity, and spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Additionally, we improve the pattern recognition rate by creating a linear conductance modulation with an incremental pulse train in pattern recognition simulations. The stable electrical characteristics and implementation of various synaptic functions demonstrate that self-aligned VRRAM is suitable for neuromorphic systems as a high-density synaptic device.
We define the framed DDF operators by introducing the concept of local frames in the usual formulation of DDF operators. In doing so it is possible to completely decouple the DDF operators from the associated tachyon and show that they are good zero-dimensional conformal operators. These framed DDFs allow for an explicit covariant formulation of the general solution of the Virasoro constraints both on-shell and off-shell which depends on a unique set of tangent space lightcone polarizations. This is possible since the frame allows us to embed the\(SO(D-2)\)lightcone physical polarizations into the\(SO(1,D-1)\)covariant ones in the most general way. The solution to the Virasoro constraints is not in the gauge that is usually used since the states obtained from DDF operators are generically the sum of terms which are partially transverse due to the presence of a projector but not traceless and terms which are partially traceless but not transverse. We then show that different embeddings are connected by states generated by improved Brower operators both on shell and off shell. Brower states are null on-shell and equivalent to BRST exact states. Therefore on shell one embedding is sufficient to compute all amplitudes except the ones with vanishing momentum. Off-shell a change of frame cannot be obtained by null states but only by Brower states. Improved Brower operators generate a gauge invariance associated with local frame rotations, which replaces the usual gauge invariance generated by Virasoro operators or BRST. To check the identification, we verify the matching of the expectation value of the second Casimir of the Poincaré group for some lightcone states with the corresponding covariant states built using the framed DDFs.
In this work we compare the predictions for the scattering length and effective range of the channels\(K^0 \Sigma ^+, K^+ \Sigma ^0, K^+ \Lambda \)and\(\eta p\), assuming the\(N^*(1535)\)state as a molecular state of these channels, or an original genuine state, made for instance from three quarks. Looking at very different scenarios, what we conclude is that the predictions of these two pictures are drastically different, to the point that we advise the measurement of these magnitudes, accessible for instance by measuring correlation functions, in order to gain much valuable information concerning the nature of this state.
This article explores the characteristics of interacting new Tsallis agegraphic dark energy (NTADE) and Sharma–Mittal holographic dark energy (SMHDE) models in a flat FLRW universe within Rastall gravity (RG). To check the viability of these models and to distinguish them, we develop important cosmological parameters including equation of state (EoS) parameter, deceleration parameterq, square speed of sound, statefinder pair andOm(z) diagnostic. By constraining the different parameters for both dark energy (DE) models, it is observed that: EoS parameter indicates phantom-like behavior, deceleration parameter is showing a phase transition from decelerating to accelerating phase. The (j,s) plane is indicating a rich behavior as it shows different DE eras like quintessence, phantom and Chaplygin gas for both models depending upon interacting term\(d^{2}\), parameter\(\delta \)and Rastall parameter\(\lambda \). The\(\omega _{D}-\omega ^{'}_{D}\)pair is indicating freezing region for NTADE but for SMHDE it initially falls in freezing region then move towards thawing region. We also check stability of NTADE/SMHDE models through the graphical interpretation of square speed of sound.
We conduct a comprehensive study on spherical orbits around two types of black holes: Kerr–Newman black holes, which are charged, and Ghosh black holes, which are nonsingular. In this work, we consider both null and timelike cases of orbits. Utilizing the Mino formalism, all analytical solutions for the geodesics governing these orbits can be obtained. It turns out that all spherical photon orbits outside the black hole horizons are unstable. In the extremal cases of both models, we obtain thephoton boomerangs. The existence of charge in the Kerr–Newman allows the orbits to transition between retrograde and prograde motions, and its increase tends to force the orbits to be more equatorial. On the other hand, the Ghosh black hole, characterized by a regular core and a lack of horizons in certain conditions, presents the possibility of observable stable spherical orbits in the so-calledno-horizoncondition. As the Ghosh parameterkincreases, trajectories tend to exhibit larger latitudinal oscillation amplitudes. We observe that as the Ghosh parameterkincreases the trajectories tend to have larger latitudinal oscillation amplitudes. Finally, we investigate the existence ofinnermost stable spherical orbits(ISSOs). Both black holes demonstrate the appearance of two branches of ISSO radii as a function of the Carter constant\({\mathcal {C}}\). However, there are notable differences in their behavior: in the case of the Kerr–Newman black hole, the branches merge at a critical value, beyond which no ISSO exists, while for the Ghosh black hole, the transcendental nature of the metric function causes the branches to become complex at some finite distance.
For the\((n+1)\)-dimensional (\(n\ge 3\)) dilaton black hole in the Einstein–Maxwell-dilaton theory, we have presented exact analytical solutions of the field equations. These exact solutions include the exact formula of the potential function as well as the exact formula of the metric function. The presence of the dilaton field makes the asymptotic behavior of these black holes no longer flat or anti-de Sitter. We have calculated the electric charge, mass, temperature, entropy and electric potential of these black holes and have shown the correctness of the first law of black hole thermodynamics. As a thermodynamic system, we have analyzed thermal stability of these types of black holes using the canonical ensemble method and, investigated the effect of dilaton field on their stability.
We experimentally demonstrate the generation of customized Laguerre–Gaussian (LG) beams whose intensity maxima are localized around any desired curves. The principle is to act with appropriate algebraic functions on the angular spectra of LG beams. We characterize the propagation properties of these beams and compare them with non-diffraction caustic beams possessing the same intensity profiles. The results manifest that the customized-LG beams can maintain their profiles during propagation and suffer less energy loss than the non-diffraction caustic beams, and hence are able to propagate a longer distance. Moreover, the customized-LG beam exhibits self-healing ability when parts of their bodies are blocked. This new structure beam has potential applications in areas such as optical communication, soliton routing and steering, and optical tweezing.
Cosmological accretion shocks created during the formation of galaxy clusters are a ubiquitous phenomenon all around the universe. These shocks and their features are intimately related with the gravitational energy at stake during galaxy cluster formation. Studying a sample of simulated galaxy clusters and their associated accretion shocks, we show that objects in our sample sit in a plane within the three-dimensional space of cluster total mass, shock radius and Mach number (a measure of shock intensity). Using this relation, and considering that forthcoming new observations will be able to measure shock radii and intensities, we put forward the idea that the dark matter content of galaxy clusters could be indirectly measured with an error up to around 30% at the 1σconfidence level. This procedure would be a new and independent method to measure the dark matter mass in cosmic structures and a novel constraint to the accepted Lambda cold dark matter paradigm.
Quantum electrodynamics is generally extended to a nonlocal QED by introducing the correlation functions. The gauge link is introduced to guarantee that the nonlocal QED is locallyU(1) gauge invariant. The corresponding Feynman rules as well as the proof of Ward–Takahashi identity are presented. As an example, the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons are studied in nonlocal QED. At one-loop level, besides the ordinary diagrams, there are many additional Feynman diagrams which are generated from the gauge link. It shows the nonlocal QED can provide a reasonable explanation for lepton\(g-2\)anomalies.
Protoplanetary disks, the birthplace of planets, are expected to be gravitationally unstable in their early phase of evolution. IM Lup, a well-known T-Tauri star, is surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with spiral arms. The disk was probably caused by gravitational instability. The IM Lup disk has been observed using various methods, but developing a unified explanatory model is challenging. Here we present a physical model of the IM Lup disk that offers a comprehensive explanation for diverse observations spanning from near-infrared to millimetre wavelengths. Our findings underscore the importance of dust fragility in retaining the observed millimetre emission and reveal the preference for moderately porous dust to explain the observed millimetre polarization. We also find that the inner disk region is probably heated by gas accretion, which provides a natural explanation for bright millimetre emission within 20 au. The actively heated inner region in the model casts a 100 au-scale shadow that aligns seamlessly with the observation of near-infrared scattered light. The accretion heating also supports the fragile-dust scenario in which accretion efficiently heats the disk midplane. Due to the fragility of the dust, it is unlikely that a potential embedded planet at 100 au formed through pebble accretion in the smooth disk, which suggests that local dust enhancement boosted pebble accretion or that there are alternative pathways, such as outward migration or gravitational fragmentation.
In standard cosmology, the cosmic homogeneity scale is the transition scale above which the patterns arising from non-uniformities – such as groups and clusters of galaxies, voids, and filaments – become indistinguishable from a random distribution of sources. Recently, different groups have investigated the feasibility of using such a scale as a cosmological test and arrived at different conclusions. In this paper, we complement and extend these studies by exploring the evolution of the spatial (\(R_{\textrm{H}}\)) and angular (\(\theta _{\textrm{H}}\)) homogeneity scales with redshift, assuming a spatially flat,\(\varLambda \)-Cold Dark Matter universe and linear cosmological perturbation theory. We confirm previous results concerning the non-monotonicity of\(R_{\textrm{H}}\)with the matter density parameter\(\varOmega _{\textrm{m0}}\)but also show that it exhibits a monotonical behavior with the Hubble constant\(H_{0}\)within a large redshift interval. More importantly, we find that, for\(z \gtrsim 0.6\),\(\theta _{\textrm{H}}\)presents a monotonical behavior with\(\varOmega _{\textrm{m0}}\), as well as for\(H_0\)the entire redshift interval analyzed. We find also that the angular homogeneity scale is sensitive to\(H_{0}\), especially at higher redshifts. Using the currently available\(\theta _{\textrm{H}}\)measurements, we illustrate the constraints on the\(\varOmega _{\textrm{m0}}\)–\(H_{0}\)plane through a MCMC analysis and show the feasibility of using the angular homogeneity scale as a new, model-independent way to constrain cosmological parameters.
The number density of impact craters on a planetary surface is used to determine its age, which requires a model for the production rate of craters of different sizes. On Mars, however, estimates of the production rate of small craters (<60 m) from orbital imagery and from extrapolation of lunar impact data do not match. Here we provide a new independent estimate of the impact rate by analysing the seismic events recorded by the seismometer onboard NASA’s InSight lander. Some previously confirmed seismically detected impacts are part of a larger class of marsquakes (very high frequency, VF). Although a non-impact origin cannot be definitively excluded for each VF event, we show that the VF class as a whole is plausibly caused by meteorite impacts. We use an empirical scaling relationship to convert between seismic moment and crater diameter. Applying area and time corrections to derive a global impact rate, we find that 280–360 craters >8 m diameter are formed globally per year, consistent with previously published chronology model rates and above the rates derived from freshly imaged craters. Our work shows that seismology is an effective tool for determining meteoroid impact rates and complements other methods such as orbital imaging.
We elaborate on nonmetric geometric flow theory and metric-affine gravity with applications in modern cosmology. Two main motivations for our research follow from the facts that (1) cosmological models forf(Q) modified gravity theories, MGTs, are efficient for describing recent observational data provided by the James Webb Space Telescope; and (2) the statistical thermodynamic properties of such nonmetric locally anisotropic cosmological models can be studied using generalizations of the concept of G. Perelman entropy. We derive nonmetric distorted R. Hamilton and Ricci soliton equations in such canonical nonholonomic variables when corresponding systems of nonlinear PDEs can be decoupled and integrated in general off-diagonal forms. This is possible if we develop and apply the anholonomic frame and connection deformation method involving corresponding types of generating functions and generating sources encoding nonmetric distortions. Using such generic off-diagonal solutions (when the coefficients of metrics and connections may depend generically on all spacetime coordinates), we model accelerating cosmological scenarios with quasi-periodic gravitational and (effective) matter fields; and study topological and nonlinear geometric properties of respective dark energy and dark matter, DE and DM, models. As explicit examples, we analyze some classes of nonlinear symmetries defining topological quasicrystal, QC, phases which can modified to generate other types of quasi-periodic and locally anisotropic structures. The conditions when such nonlinear systems possess a behaviour which is similar to that of the Lambda cold dark matter (\(\Lambda \)CDM) scenario are stated. We conclude that nonmetric geometric and cosmological flows can be considered as an alternative to the\(\Lambda \)CDM concordance models and speculate on how such theories can be elaborated. This is a partner work with generalizations and applications of the results published by Bubuianu, Vacaru et all. EPJC 84 (2024) 211; 80 (2020) 639; 78 (2018) 393; 78 (2018) 969; and CQG 35 (2018) 245009.
The next generation of searches for neutrinoless double beta decay (\(0 \nu \beta \beta \)) are poised to answer deep questions on the nature of neutrinos and the source of the Universe’s matter–antimatter asymmetry. They will be looking for event rates of less than one event per ton of instrumented isotope per year. To claim discovery, accurate and efficient simulations of detector events that mimic\(0 \nu \beta \beta \)is critical. Traditional Monte Carlo (MC) simulations can be supplemented by machine-learning-based generative models. This work describes the performance of generative models that we designed for monolithic liquid scintillator detectors like KamLAND to produce accurate simulation data without a predefined physics model. We present their current ability to recover low-level features and perform interpolation. In the future, the results of these generative models can be used to improve event classification and background rejection by providing high-quality abundant generated data.
The shape of the dark matter (DM) halo is key to understanding the hierarchical formation of the Galaxy. Despite extensive efforts in recent decades, however, its shape remains a matter of debate, with suggestions ranging from strongly oblate to prolate. Here, we present a new constraint on its present shape by directly measuring the evolution of the Galactic disk warp with time, as traced by accurate distance estimates and precise age determinations for about 2,600 classical Cepheids. We show that the Galactic warp is mildly precessing in a retrograde direction at a rate ofω= −2.1 ± 0.5 (statistical) ± 0.6 (systematic) km s−1kpc−1for the outer disk over the Galactocentric radius [7.5, 25] kpc, decreasing with radius. This constrains the shape of the DM halo to be slightly oblate with a flattening (minor axis to major axis ratio) in the range 0.84 ≤qΦ≤ 0.96. Given the young nature of the disk warp traced by Cepheids (less than 200 Myr), our approach directly measures the shape of the present-day DM halo. This measurement, combined with other measurements from older tracers, could provide vital constraints on the evolution of the DM halo and the assembly history of the Galaxy.
The radial structure of a galaxy is a fundamental property that reflects its growth and assembly history. Although it is straightforward to measure that of external galaxies, it is challenging for the Milky Way because of our inside perspective. Traditionally, the radial structure of the Milky Way has been assumed to be characterized by a single-exponential disk and a central bulge component. Here we report (1) a measurement of the age-resolved Galactic surface brightness profile in a wide radial range fromR= 0 to 17 kpc and (2) the corresponding size of the Milky Way in terms of a half-light radius. We find a broken surface brightness profile with a nearly flat distribution between 3.5 and 7.5 kpc, in contrast to a canonical single-exponential disk. This broken profile results in a half-light radius of 5.75 ± 0.38 kpc, significantly larger than that inferred from a single-exponential disk profile but consistent with that of local disk galaxies of similar mass. We also confirm that the size growth history of the Milky Way is broadly consistent with high-redshift galaxies but with systematically smaller size. Our results suggest that the Milky Way has a more complex radial structure and larger size than previously expected.
No-hair theorem indicates that black holes cannot have their own magnetic dipole moment. They can be weakly magnetized in binary systems with a neutron star companion and an accretion disc of charged particles. A simple model suggested by Petterson states that a current loop accreting a Schwarzschild black hole generates dipole-like magnetic fields in the outer region of the loop that are uniform in the inner region. This study considers circular motion and collisions of charged test particles with magnetic dipole moments in the inner and outer regions. First, we derive the effective potential taking into account the magnetic interactions between external magnetic fields with electric charge and the magnetic dipole moment of the particle. We investigate the possible innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of the charged and magnetized particles orbiting the magnetized Schwarzschild black hole inside and outside the current loop. Finally, we explore the collisional processes of these particles near the black hole horizons, examining the effects of magnetic interactions on the critical angular momentum of particles that may collide and the center of mass energy of the colliding particles. We discuss astrophysical relevant objects with magnetic dipole moment and electric charge: magnetized neutron stars, white dwarfs, rotating stellar-mass black holes, electrons, and protons, and also estimate the interaction parameters for them.
This work deals with scalar quasinormal modes using the higher-order WKB method and black hole shadow in non-minimal Einstein–Yang–Mills theory. To validate the results of quasinormal modes, time domain profiles are also investigated. We find that with an increase in the magnetic charge of the black hole, the ringdown gravitational wave increases non-linearly and the damping rate decreases non-linearly. The presence of a magnetic charge also results in a non-linear decrease in the black hole shadow. For large values of the coupling parameter, the black hole becomes a soliton solution and the corresponding ringdown gravitational wave frequency increases slowly with a decrease in the damping rate. For the soliton solutions, the shadow is also smaller. The constraints on the model parameters calculated using shadow observations of M87* and Sgr A* and an approximate analytical relation between quasinormal modes and shadows at the eikonal limit are discussed.
Data-driving determination of the new properties of elastic scattering at small angles on the basis on all existing experimental data for\(d\sigma /dt\)ofppand\(p\bar{p}\)at\(\sqrt{s} \ge 540\)GeV allows us to obtain the main characteristics of the nonstandard terms of the elastic scattering amplitude. The energy dependence of the oscillation term and the term with an extremely large slope is determined. It was shown that part of the oscillation term has a different sign forppand\(p\bar{p}\)reactions; hence, it is part of the Odderon amplitude. The period of the oscillation term agrees with the scaling properties predicted by the Auberson–Kinoshita–Martin (AKM) theorem. The high quality quantitative description of all data at\(\sqrt{s} \ge 540\)GeV in the framework of the high energy general structure (HEGS) model supports such a phenomenon which can be connected with peripheral hadron interaction.
Effective field theories endowed with a nontrivial moduli space may be broken down by several, distinct effects as the energy scales that are probed increase. These may include the appearance of a finite number of new states, or the emergence of an infinite tower of states, as predicted by the Distance Conjecture. Consequently, the moduli space can be partitioned according to which kind of state first breaks down the effective description, and the effective-theory cutoff has to be regarded as a function of the moduli that may abruptly vary in form across the components of the partition. In this work we characterize such a slicing of the moduli space, induced by the diverse breakdown mechanisms, in a two-fold way. Firstly, employing the recently formulated Tameness Conjecture, we show that the partition of the moduli space so constructed is composed only of a finite number of distinct components. Secondly, we illustrate how this partition can be concretely constructed by means of supervised machine learning techniques, with minimal bottom-up information.
We investigate the response of Casimir energies to fluctuations in a scalar field in the background of a weak gravitational field in\(\kappa \)-deformed space-time. We model the Casimir plates in a gravitational field by\(\kappa \)-deformed Rindler coordinates and calculate the Casimir energy using the\(\kappa \)-deformed scalar field. We show that the Casimir energy accelerates in a weak gravitational field like a mass. Thus, our calculations show that the mass–energy equivalence principle holds in\(\kappa \)-deformed space-time even though a length scale is introduced through space-time non-commutativity.
We compute the quasinormal modes of massive scalar and Dirac fields within the framework of asymptotically de Sitter black holes in Euler–Heisenberg non-linear electrodynamics. We pay particular attention to the regime\(\mu M/m_{P}^2 \gg 1,\)where\(\mu \)andMdenote the masses of the field and the black hole, respectively, and\(m_{P}\)represents the Planck mass, covering a range from primordial to large astrophysical black holes. Through time-domain integration, we demonstrate that, contrary to the asymptotically flat case, the quasinormal modes also dictate the asymptotic decay of fields. Employing the 6th order WKB formula, we derive a precise analytic approximation for quasinormal modes in the regime\(\mu M/m_{P}^2 \gg 1\)without resorting to expansion in terms of the inverse multipole number. This analytic expression takes on a concise form in the limit of linear electrodynamics, represented by the Reissner–Nordström black holes. Our numerical analysis indicates the stability of the fields under consideration against linear perturbations.
This study explores the potential existence of traversable wormholes influenced by a global monopole charge within thef(Q) gravity framework. To elucidate the characteristics of these wormholes, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of wormhole solutions employing three different forms of redshift function under a linearf(Q) model. Wormhole shape functions were derived for barotropic, anisotropic, and isotropic Equations of State (EoS) cases. However, in the isotropic EoS case, the calculated shape function failed to satisfy the asymptotic flatness condition. Additionally, we observed that our obtained shape functions adhered to the flaring-out conditions under an asymptotic background for the remaining EoS cases. Furthermore, we examined the energy conditions at the wormhole throat with a radius\(r_0\). We noted the influences of the global monopole’s parameter\(\eta \), the EoS parameter\(\omega \), andnin violating energy conditions, particularly the null energy conditions. Finally, we conducted a stability analysis utilizing the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkov (TOV) equation and found that our obtained wormhole solution is stable.
We investigate the leading twist generalized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) of the unpolarized and longitudinally polarized gluons in the nucleon. We adopt a light-front gluon-triquark model for the nucleon motivated by soft-wall AdS/QCD. The gluon GTMDs are defined through the off-forward gluon-gluon generalized correlator and are expressed as the overlap of light-cone wave functions. The GTMDs can be employed to provide the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) by integrating out the transverse momentum. The Fourier transform of the GPDs encodes the parton distributions in the transverse position space, namely, the impact parameter dependent parton distributions (IPDs). We also calculate the three gluon IPDs corresponding to the GPDs\(H^g\),\(E^g\)and\(\widetilde{H}^g\), and present their dependence onxand\(b_\perp \), respectively.
We investigate the radiation from accelerating electrons with asymptotic constant velocity and their analog signatures as evaporating black holes with left-over remnants. We find high-speed electrons, while having a high temperature, correspond to low-temperature analog remnants.
In general asymptotically flat spacetimes, bearing the null geodesics reaching the future null infinity in mind, we propose new concepts, the “dark horizons” (outer dark horizon and inner dark horizon) as generalizations of the photon sphere. They are defined in terms of the structure of escape/capture cones of photons with respect to a unit timelike vector field to capture the motion of light sources. More specifically, considering a two-sphere that represents a set of emission directions of photons, the dark horizons are located at positions where a hemisphere is marginally included in the capture and escape cones, respectively. In addition, our definition succeeds in incorporating relativistic beaming effect. We show that the dark horizon is absent in the Minkowski spacetime, while they exist in spacetimes with black hole(s) under a certain condition. We derive the general properties of the dark horizons in spherically symmetric spacetimes and explicitly calculate the locations of the dark horizons in the Vaidya spacetime and the Kerr spacetime. In particular, in the Kerr spacetime, the outer dark horizon coincides with the shadow observed from infinity on the rotation axis.
Supergranules, which are solar flow features with a lateral scale of 30,000–40,000 km and a lifetime of ~24 h, form a prominent component of the Sun’s convective spectrum. However, their internal flows, which can be probed only by helioseismology, are not well understood. We analyse dopplergrams recorded by the Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite to identify and characterize ~23,000 supergranules. We find that the vertical flows peak at a depth of ~10,000 km, and remain invariant over the full range of lateral supergranular scales, contrary to numerical predictions. We also infer that, within the local seismic resolution (≳5,000 km), downflows are ~40% weaker than upflows, indicating an apparent mass-flux imbalance. This may imply that the descending flows also comprise plumes, which maintain the mass balance but are simply too small to be detected by seismic waves. These results challenge the widely used mixing-length description of solar convection.
The present work looks for the possible existence of static and spherically symmetric wormhole geometries in Rastall–Rainbow gravity. Since, the Rastall–Rainbow gravity model has been constructed with the combination of Rastall theory and the gravity’s rainbow formalism. Taking advantage of the Karmarkar condition for embedding class one metrics, we solve the modified field equations analytically that describe wormholes for specific choice of redshift function. For specific parameter ranges, the solution represents a traversable wormhole that exhibits the violation of null energy condition and consequently the weak energy condition also. Furthermore, we focus on the wormhole stability via adiabatic sound velocity analysis. This model establishes a strong connection between two model parameters, namely, the Rastall parameters and the Rainbow functions, and how it affects the wormhole solution.
We extend a recently proposed framework, dubbed inflation by supersymmetry breaking, to hybrid inflation by introducing a waterfall field that allows to decouple the supersymmetry breaking scale in the observable sector from the inflation scale, while keeping intact the inflation sector and its successful predictions: naturally small slow-roll parameters, small field initial conditions and absence of the pseudo-scalar companion of the inflaton, in terms of one free parameter which is the first order correction to the inflaton Kähler potential. During inflation, supersymmetry is spontaneously broken with the inflaton being the superpartner of the goldstino, together with a massive vector that gauges the R-symmetry. Inflation arises around the maximum of the scalar potential at the origin where R-symmetry is unbroken. Moreover, a nearby minimum with tuneable vacuum energy can be accommodated by introducing a second order correction to the Kähler potential. The inflaton sector can also play the role of the supersymmetry breaking ‘hidden’ sector when coupled to the (supersymmetric) Standard Model, predicting a superheavy superparticle spectrum near the inflation scale. Here we show that the introduction of a waterfall field provides a natural way to end inflation and allows for a scale separation between supersymmetry breaking and inflation. Moreover, the study of the global vacuum describing low energy Standard Model physics can be done in a perturbative way within a region of the parameter space of the model.
During the public Kaggle competition “IceCube – Neutrinos in Deep Ice”, thousands of reconstruction algorithms were created and submitted, aiming to estimate the direction of neutrino events recorded by the IceCube detector. Here we describe in detail the three ultimate best, award-winning solutions. The data handling, architecture, and training process of each of these machine learning models is laid out, followed up by an in-depth comparison of the performance on the Kaggle datatset. We show that on cascade events in IceCube above 10 TeV, the best Kaggle solution is able to achieve an angular resolution of better than 5\(^{\circ }\), and for tracks correspondingly better than 0.5\(^{\circ }\). These results indicate that the Kaggle solutions perform at a level comparable to the current state-of-the-art in the field, and that they may even be able to outperform existing reconstruction resolutions for certain types of events.
We suggest a simple relation between the quark and the lepton mixing within the framework of type-I seesaw mechanism. We show that within our ansatz the empirical King–Mohapatra–Smirnov relation, which suggests a connection between the CKM and PMNS mixing where\(|V^\text {PMNS}_{13}|\approx \sin \theta _C/\sqrt{2} \), can be derived. This is possible within a restricted region of the Dirac and Majorana mass parameters.
In this study, we aim to see how much the actual measurement of the Z+photon and di-photon signal strength,\(\mu _{\gamma \gamma }\)and\(\mu _{\gamma Z}\), could influence the allowed parameter space of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM), and to what extent such measurement can be aligned with the latest bound from XenonNT experiment on the spin-independent dark-matter-nucleon scattering cross-section. Also, by considering the new embedded scalars in the IDM (i.e.,S,Aand\(H^\pm \)), a wide investigation of the one-loop radiative corrections to the trilinear Higgs couplinghhhhas been made in the light of the previous measurements.
We investigate the geodesic motions of timelike particles around a static hairy black hole with conformally coupled scalar field. We mainly focus on the effects of the scalar charge and electric charge on the marginally bound orbits (MBO), innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and on the precessing orbits around this black hole. Our results show that both the scalar and electric charges suppress the energy as well as the angular momentum of the particles in the bound orbits. Then, we study the relativistic periastron precessions of the particles and constrain the charge parameters by employing the observational result of the S2 star’s precession in SgrA*. It is found that the constraints on the charge parameters from S2 star’s motion are tighter than those from black hole shadow. Finally, we analyze the periodic motions of the particles and figure out samples of periodic orbits’ configurations around the hairy black hole.
We explore superoscillations within the context of classical and quantum field theories, presenting novel solutions to Klein–Gordon’s, Dirac’s, Maxwell’s and Einstein’s equations. In particular, we illustrate a procedure of second quantization of fields and how to construct a Fock space which encompasses Superoscillating states. Furthermore, we extend the application of superoscillations to quantum tunnelings, scatterings and mixings of particles, squeezed states and potential advancements in laser interferometry, which could open new avenues for experimental tests of quantum gravity effects. By delving into the relationship among superoscillations and phenomena such as Hawking radiation, the black hole (BH) information and the Firewall paradox, we propose an alternative mechanism for information transfer across the BH event horizon.
A series of far-detector programs have been proposed for operation at various interaction points of the large hadron collider during the upcoming runs. Investigating the potential and complementarity of these experiments for new-physics searches goes through the estimation of their sensitivity to specific long-lived particle models. Here, we present an integrated numerical tool written in the C++ language and calledDisplaced Decay Counter, which we have created to this end and which can be used in association withMadGraph5,Pythia8, or any other state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo collider simulation tool. Several far-detector models have been implemented within the program, accounting for the geometry and integrated luminosity of projected detectors. Additional or more accurate designs can be easily constructed through a dedicated interface. The functionality of this tool is exemplified through the discussion of several benchmark scenarios, which we consider for the validation of the implemented detector models.
The precise reconstruction of properties of photons and electrons in modern high energy physics detectors, such as the CMS or ATLAS experiments, plays a crucial role in numerous physics results. Conventional geometrical algorithms are used to reconstruct the energy and position of these particles from the showers they induce in the electromagnetic calorimeter. Despite their accuracy and efficiency, these methods still suffer from several limitations, such as low-energy background and limited capacity to reconstruct close-by particles. This paper introduces an innovative machine-learning technique to measure the energy and position of photons and electrons based on convolutional and graph neural networks, taking the geometry of the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter as an example. The developed network demonstrates a significant improvement in resolution both for photon energy and position predictions compared to the algorithm used in CMS. Notably, one of the main advantages of this new approach is its ability to better distinguish between multiple close-by electromagnetic showers.
In the framework of the Asymptotic Safety scenario for quantum gravity, we analyze quantum gravity modifications to the thermal characteristics of a thin accretion disk spiraling around a renormalization group improved (RGI-) Kerr black hole in the low energy regime. We focused on the quantum effects on the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), the energy flux from the disk, the disk temperature, the observed redshifted luminosity, and the accretion efficiency. The deviations from the classical general relativity due to quantum effects are described for a free parameter that arises in the improved Kerr metric as a consequence of the fact that the Newton constant turns into a running couplingG(r) depending on the energy scale. We find that, both for rapid and slow rotating black holes with accretion disks in prograde and retrograde circulation, increases in the value of this parameter are accompanied by a decreasing of the ISCO, by a lifting of the peaks of the radiation properties of the disk and by an increase of the accretion mass efficiency, as compared with the predictions of general relativity. Our results confirm previously established findings in Zuluaga and Sánchez (Eur Phys J C 81:840, 2021) where we showed that these quantum gravity effects also occur for an accretion disk around a RGI-Schwarzschild black hole.
Alternative cosmological models have been proposed to alleviate the tensions reported in the concordance cosmological model, or to explain the current accelerated phase of the universe. One way to distinguish between General Relativity and modified gravity models is using current astronomical data to measure the growth index\(\gamma \), a parameter related to the growth of matter perturbations, which behaves differently in different metric theories. We propose a model independent methodology for determining\(\gamma \), where our analyses combine diverse cosmological data sets, namely\(\{ f(z_i) \}\),\(\{ [f\sigma _8](z_i) \}\), and\(\{ H(z_i) \}\), and use Gaussian Processes, a non-parametric approach suitable to reconstruct functions. This methodology is a new consistency test for\(\gamma \)constant. Our results show that, for the redshift interval\(0< z < 1\),\(\gamma \)is consistent with the constant value\(\gamma = 0.55\), expected in General Relativity theory, within\(2 \sigma \)confidence level (CL). Moreover, we find\(\gamma (z=0)\)= 0.311\(\pm 0.144 \)and\(\gamma (z=0) = 0.609 \pm 0.200\)for the reconstructions using the\(\{ f(z_i) \}\)and\(\{ [f\sigma _8](z_i) \}\)data sets, respectively, values that also agree at a 2\(\sigma \)CL with\(\gamma = 0.55\). Our methodology and analyses can be considered as an alternative approach in light of the current discussion in the literature that suggests a possible evidence for the growth index evolution.
The cosmological tensor perturbation equation with generalized holonomy corrections is derived in the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. This results in a generalized dispersion relation for gravitational waves, encompassing holonomy corrections. Furthermore, we conduct an examination of the constraint algebra concerning vector modes with generalized holonomy corrections. The requirement of anomaly cancellation for vector modes imposes constraints on the possible functional forms of the generalized holonomy corrections. What’s more, we estimate the theoretical value of the effective graviton mass and discuss the potential detectability of this effective mass in future observations.
Van der Waals epitaxy allows heterostructure formation without considering the lattice match requirement, thus is a promising method to form 2D/2D and 2D/3D heterojunction. Considering the unique optical properties of CsPbI3and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), their heterostructure presents potential applications in both photonics and optoelectronics fields. Here, we demonstrate selective growth of cubic phase CsPbI3nanofilm with thickness as thin as 4.0 nm and zigzag/armchair oriented nanowires (NWs) on monolayer WSe2. Furthermore, we show growth of CsPbI3on both transferred WSe2on copper grid and WSe2–based optoelectrical devices, providing a platform for structure analysis and device performance modification. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results reveal the epitaxial nature of cubic CsPbI3phase. The revealed growth fundamental of CsPbI3is universal valid for other two-dimensional substrates, offering a great advantage to fabricate CsPbI3based van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and optical characterization confirm the type-II band alignment, resulting in a fast charge transfer process and the occurrence of a broad emission peak at lower energy. The formation of WSe2/CsPbI3heterostructure largely enhances the photocurrent from 2.38 nA to 38.59 nA. These findings are vital for bottom-up epitaxy of inorganic semiconductor on atomic thin 2D substrates for optoelectronic applications.
We study the rare decay process ofZboson into photon, accompanied by a CP-even or CP-odd scalar. We present the analytical delineation of the processes through the model-independent parametrizations of the new physics couplings and, finally, consider the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model to mark out the parameter space where the branching fraction can have the maximum value. As a part of the necessary phenomenological and experimental cross-checks, we aim to fit the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon andWboson mass anomaly through the supersymmetric contributions. We also find that the decays\(Z\rightarrow H_1 \gamma , A_1 \gamma \)can serve as an excellent complementary test to\(BR(h_{\textrm{SM}}\rightarrow Z\gamma ).\)In fact, to facilitate future searches, we unveil a few benchmark points that additionally satisfy the deviation of\(BR(h_{\textrm{SM}}\rightarrow Z\gamma )\)from the SM value based on the recent measurements of ATLAS and CMS. Future proposals such as ILC, CEPC, and FCC-ee are anticipated to operate for multiple years, focusing on center-of-mass energy near theZpole. Consequently, these projects will be capable of conducting experiments at the Giga-Z\((10^{9}\)ofZbosons) and Tera-Z\((10^{12}\)ofZbosons) phases, which may probe the aforesaid rare decay processes, thus the model as well. These unconventional yet complementary searches offer different routes to explore the supersymmetric models with extended Higgs sectors like NMSSM.
In this work theB-mesons differential cross sections inppcollisions are evaluated considering the color dipole formalism in transverse momentum representation along with the unintegrated gluon distributions (UGDs). Analytical parametrizations for UGDs including hard scale QCD evolution and those based on parton saturation framework are compared. The theoretical predictions for theB-meson production in terms of the transverse momentum distribution cover the center-of-mass energy of the Large Hadron Collider and the rapidities available at its experiments. The results for differentB-mesons are compared to the corresponding measurements reported by the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments. Predictions are also performed for the nuclear modification factor as a function of the meson transverse momentum.
The quanta of scalar fields like the dilaton (\(\phi \)) of scale symmetry origin and those of pseudoscalar fields like the axion (\(\phi '\)) of Peccei–Quinn symmetry origin couple to di-photons through dimension-5 operators. In a magnetized medium (MM), they in principle can interact with the two transverse (\(A_{\parallel ,\perp }\)) and one longitudinal (\(A_{L}\)) degree of freedom of photons (\(\gamma \)) as long as the total spin is conserved. However, of\(\phi \)and\(\phi '\), only one interacts with\(A_{L}\). We found that the ambient external magnetic fieldBand media break the intrinsic Lorentz symmetry of the system affecting the dispersion relation of the propagating modes. The boost and the rotational symmetry along and aroundBare however the ones that are preserved. Invoking C, P, and T symmetries, we analyze the mixing dynamics of\(\phi \gamma \)and\(\phi '\gamma \)systems and the structuraldifferencein their mixing pattern. It is noted that while the\(\phi \gamma \)mixing matrix is\(3\times 3\), the\(\phi ^{\prime }\gamma \)is governed by a\(4\times 4\)mixing matrix. Using the exact solutions of both systems in MM, we estimate the strength of the electromagnetic (EM) signals available due to these interactions, which are found to bedifferentin strength. We conclude by commenting on (a) the possibility of detecting thisdifferencein polarimetric observables of the EM signal, (b) the implications of these different mixing patterns with respect to the minimum detectable signal for astrophysical observations, and (c) the variation in the energy of the dispersed photons of different polarization with the variation inB.
A flat Friedmann–Lematre–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) spacetime metric was used to investigate some exact cosmological models in metric-affineF(R,T) gravity in this paper. The considered modified Lagrangian function is\(F(R,T)=R+\lambda T\), whereRis the Ricci curvature scalar,Tis the torsion scalar for the non-special connection, and\(\lambda \)is a model parameter. We also wrote\(R=R^{(LC)}+u\)and\(T=T^{(W)}+v\), where\(R^{(LC)}\)is the Ricci scalar curvature with respect to the Levi–Civita connection and\(T^{(W)}\)is the torsion scalar with respect to the Weitzenbock connection, anduandvare the functions of scale factora(t), connection and its derivatives. For the scale factora(t), we have obtained two exact solutions of modified field equations in two different situations ofuandv. Using this scale factor, we have obtained various geometrical parameters to investigate the universe’s cosmological properties. We used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to analyze two types of latest datasets: cosmic chronometer (CC) data (Hubble data) points and Pantheon SNe Ia samples, and found the model parameters that fit the observations best at\(1-\sigma \), and\(2-\sigma \)regions. We have performed a comparative and relativistic study of geometrical and cosmological parameters. In model-I, we have found that the effective equation of state (EoS) parameter\(\omega _{eff}\)varies in the range\(-1\le \omega _{eff}\le 0\), while in model-II, it varies as\(-1.0345\le \omega _{eff}\le 0\). We found that both models are transit phase (moving from slowing down to speeding up) universes with a transition redshift\(z_{t}=0.5874_{-0.0197}^{+0.2130}\)and\(z_{t}=0.6865_{-0.0303}^{+0.1719}\).
In big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), the light matter abundance is dictated by the neutron-to-proton (n/p) ratio which is controlled by the standard weak processes in the early universe. Here, we study the effect of an extra particle species (\(\chi \)) whichco-annihilateswith neutron (proton), thereby potentially changing the (n/p) ratio in addition to the former processes. We find a novel interplay between the co-annihilation and the weak interaction in deciding the (n/p) ratio and the yield of\(\chi \). Large co-annihilation strength (\(G_D\)) in comparison to the weak coupling (\(G_F\)), potentially can alter the number of nucleons in the thermal bath modifying the (n/p) ratio from its standard evolution. We find that the standard BBN prediction is restored for\(G_D/G_F \lesssim 10^{-2}\), while the mass of\(\chi \)being much smaller than the neutron mass. When the mass of\(\chi \)is comparable to the neutron mass, we can allow large\(G_D/G_F ~(\gtrsim 10^2)\)values, as the thermal abundance of\(\chi \)becomes Boltzmann-suppressed. Therefore, the (n/p) ratio is restored to its standard value via dominant weak processes in later epochs. We also discuss the stability of the new particle in an effective theory framework for co-annihilation. Further, the co-annihilation interaction generates elastic scattering of\(\chi \)and nucleons at the next-to-leading order. This provides a way to probe the scenario in direct detection experiments, if\(\chi \)is accidentally stable over cosmological timescale.
We formulate a light-front spectator model for the proton that incorporates the presence of light sea quarks. In this particular model, the sea quarks are seen as active partons, whereas the remaining components of the proton are treated as spectators. The proposed model relies on the formulation of the light-front wave function constructed by the soft wall AdS/QCD. The model wave functions are parameterized by fitting the unpolarized parton distribution functions of light sea quarks from the CTEQ18 global analysis. We then employ the light-front wave functions to obtain the sea quarks generalized parton distribution functions, transverse momentum dependent parton distributions, and their asymmetries, which are accessible in the upcoming Electron-Ion-Colliders. We investigate sea quarks’ spin and orbital angular momentum contributions to the proton spin.
The accretion of matter by compact objects can be inhibited by radiation pressure if the luminosity exceeds a critical value known as the Eddington limit. The discovery of ultraluminous X-ray sources has shown that accretion can proceed even when the apparent luminosity considerably exceeds this limit. A high apparent luminosity might be produced due to the geometric beaming of radiation by an outflow. The outflow half-opening angle, which determines the amplification due to beaming, has never been robustly constrained. Using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, we measured the X-ray polarization in the Galactic X-ray binary Cygnus X-3 (Cyg X-3). We found high, >20%, nearly energy-independent linear polarization orthogonal to the direction of the radio ejections. These properties unambiguously indicate the presence of a collimating outflow from the X-ray binary Cyg X-3 and constrain its half-opening angle to ≲15°. Thus, the source can be used as a laboratory for studying the supercritical accretion regime. This finding underscores the importance of X-ray polarimetry in advancing our understanding of accreting sources.
Jupiter’s upper atmosphere is composed of a neutral thermosphere and charged ionosphere. In the latter, the dominant molecular ion H3+emits in the near-infrared, allowing for the remote exploration of the physical properties of the upper atmosphere. However, the Jovian low-latitude ionosphere remains largely unexplored because H3+emissions from this region are faint and spectrally entangled with bright neutral species, such as CH4. Here, we present James Webb Space Telescope H3+observations of Jupiter’s low-latitude ionosphere in the region of the Great Red Spot, showing unexpected small-scale intensity features such as arcs, bands and spots. Our observations may imply that the low-latitude ionosphere of Jupiter is strongly coupled to the lower atmosphere via gravity waves that superimpose to produce this complex and intricate morphology.
LSZ-type reduction formulae are derived for gauge fields and fermions in curved spacetime. The formulae are derived using a conserved current method applicable also to flat spacetimes. The method generalizes to more general quantum field theories. The formulae are then applied to a couple of basic problems to illustrate their use.
In this study, we investigate the potential existence of a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity using a compilation of galaxy clusters. We focus on the disformal scenario of a non-minimal model with an associated coupling lengthL. Within the Newtonian approximation, this model introduces a modification to the Poisson equation, characterized by a term proportional to\(L^2 \nabla ^2 \rho \), where\(\rho \)represents the density of the DM field. We have tested the model by examining strong and weak gravitational lensing data available for a selection of 19 high-mass galaxy clusters observed by the CLASH survey. We have employed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code to explore the parameter space, and two different statistical approaches to analyse our results: a standard marginalisation and a profile distribution method. Notably, the profile distribution analysis helps out to bypass some volume-effects in the posterior distribution, and reveals lower Navarro–Frenk–White concentrations and masses in the non-minimal coupling model compared to general relativity case. We also found a nearly perfect correlation between the coupling constantLand the standard Navarro–Frenk–White scale parameter\(r_s\), hinting at a compelling link between these two lengths.
We present a comprehensive analysis of quasinormal modes (QNMs) for noncommutative geometry-inspired Schwarzschild black holes, encompassing both non-extreme and extreme cases. By employing a spectral method, we calculate the QNMs in the context of scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations. Our findings not only challenge previous claims in the literature regarding the instability of these black holes but also reveal remarkable stability for both non-extreme and extreme Schwarzschild black holes under various perturbations.
The onset and the development of the concept of exchange force in quantum physics are historically reconstructed, starting from Heisenberg’s seminal contributions in 1926 and going through the great developments in nuclear physics, which allowed the emergence of the idea of force mediating virtual quanta. Although most of such work was performed in Europe, the last and decisive effort in this long path was carried out by Japanese scientists in the 1930s. This is the main focus of the present work, which retraces the achievements of Yukawa and Tomonaga, whose results and mutual interactions are carefully analyzed and related to those of European physicists.
The low-energy antineutrino- and neutrino–nucleon neutral current elastic scattering is studied within the framework of the relativisticSU(2) baryon chiral perturbation theory up to the order of\({\cal O}({p^{3}})\). We have derived the model-independent hadronic amplitudes and extracted the form factors from them. It is found that differential cross sections dσ/dQ2for the processes of (anti)neutrino–proton scattering are in good agreement with the existing MiniBooNE data in theQ2region [0.13, 0.20] GeV2, where nuclear effects are expected to be negligible. ForQ2≤ 0.13 GeV2, large deviation is observed, which is mainly owing to the sizeable Pauli blocking effect. Comparisons with the simulation data produced by the NuWro and GENIE Mento Carlo events generators are also discussed. The chiral results obtained in this work can be utilized as inputs in various nuclear models to achieve the goal of precise determination of the strangeness axial vector form factor, in particular when the low-energy MicroBooNE data are available in the near future.
Metasurfaces and metagratings offer new platforms for electromagnetic wave control with significant responses. However, metasurfaces based on abrupt phase change and resonant structures suffer from the drawback of high loss and face challenges when applied in water waves. Therefore, the application of metasurfaces in water wave control is not ideal due to the limitations associated with high loss and other challenges. We have discovered that non-resonant metagratings exhibit promising effects in water wave control. Leveraging the similarity between bridges and metagratings, we have successfully developed a water wave metagrating model inspired by the ancient Luoyang Bridge in China. We conduct theoretical calculations and simulations on the metagrating and derive the equivalent anisotropic model of the metagrating. This model provides evidence that the metagrating has the capability to control water waves and achieve unidirectional surface water wave. The accuracy of our theory is strongly supported by the clear observation of the unidirectional propagation phenomenon during simulation and experiments conducted using a reduced version of the metagrating. It is the first time that the unidirectional propagation of water waves has been seen in water wave metagrating experiment. Above all, we realize the water wave metagrating experiment for the first time. By combining complex gratings with real bridges, we explore the physics embedded in the ancient building — Luoyang Bridge, which are of great significance for the water wave metagrating design and provide a new method for analyzing the effects of water waves on bridges. At the same time, this discovery also provides a new idea for ocean cargo transportation, ocean garbage cleaning, and the development and protection of ancient bridges.
Nanophase iron particles (npFe0) are generated on the surface of airless bodies by space weathering and can alter surficial optical properties substantially. However, the details of their formation pathways are still unclear. Here we use impact glasses returned from the Moon by Chang’e-5 to distinguish the relative contributions of solar wind irradiation and (micro)meteorites impacts to the production of different-sized npFe0. We show that solar wind irradiation can solely produce small npFe0, via implantation of solar wind ions into the topmost grain surfaces. On the other hand, (micro)meteorite impacts produce directly large npFe0in melts, through impact-triggered disproportionation reaction or thermal decomposition. These nanoparticles are also capable to further coalesce into micrometre-sized Fe0particles during impacts. These findings can help in predicting the space-weathering behaviour of regions exposed to different space environments.
Neutron stars are the dense and highly magnetic relics of supernova explosions of massive stars. The quest to constrain the equation of state (EOS) of ultradense matter and thereby probe the behaviour of matter inside neutron stars is one of the core goals of modern physics and astrophysics. A promising method involves investigating the long-term cooling of neutron stars, comparing theoretical predictions with various sources at different ages. However, limited observational data, and uncertainties in source ages and distances, have hindered this approach. Here, by re-analysing XMM-Newton and Chandra data from dozens of thermally emitting isolated neutron stars, we have identified three sources with unexpectedly cold surface temperatures for their young ages. To investigate these anomalies, we conducted magneto-thermal simulations across diverse mass and magnetic fields, considering three different EOSs. We found that the ’minimal’ cooling model failed to explain the observations, regardless of the mass and the magnetic field, as validated by a machine learning classification method. The existence of these young cold neutron stars suggests that any dense matter EOS must be compatible with a fast cooling process at least in certain mass ranges, eliminating a significant portion of current EOS options according to recent meta-modelling analysis.
The cosmic birefringence (CB) angle refers to the rotation of the linear polarization plane of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiations when parity-violating theories are considered. We analyzed the Quantum Boltzmann equation for an ensemble of CMB photons interacting with the right-handed sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) and axion-like particles (ALPs) DM in the presence of the scalar metric perturbation. We used the birefringence angle of CMB to study those probable candidates of DM. It is shown that the CB angle contribution of sterile neutrino is much less that two other sources considered here. Next, we combined the results of the cosmic neutrinos’ contribution and the contribution of the ALPs to producing the CMB birefringence and discussed the uncertainty on the parameter space of axions caused by the share of CMB-cosmic neutrino interaction in generating this effect. Finally, we plotted the EB power spectrum of the CMB and showed that this spectrum behaves differently in the presence of cosmic neutrinos and ALPs interactions in smalll. Hence, future observed data for\(C^{l}_{EB},\)will help us to distinguish the CB angle value due to the various sources of its production.
We present a complete set of 4-point amplitudes in the constructive Standard Model at tree level. Any 4-point amplitude can be obtained from the results presented here by a suitable choice of masses, a permutation of the particles (by crossing symmetry), and a reversal of the momenta of the outgoing particles. We have validated all of these amplitudes by comparing with Feynman diagrams for a variety of masses, scattering energy and angles, and helicities of the photons and gluons, when they are in the initial states. The standard constructive techniques work for these amplitudes without the need for any contact terms and indeed, contact terms are not allowed. Only three 4-point vertices are used (allowed), involving the Higgs boson and theWandZbosons. When external photons or gluons are present, the amplitude simplifies to a single spinor-product structure, present in the numerator. In a few cases, however, the propagator structure is more complex, with different terms depending on the charge or color structure. In the case of internal photons or gluons, we find that the massless limit of a massive photon or gluon diagram gives the correct result in all cases. We have additionally found that using thexfactor directly gives the correct result in all cases and agrees with the massless limit calculation.
We study the Unruh effect in doubly special relativity (DSR) framework by generalising the Doppler-shift method to DSR. For both the scalar and Dirac particles, we observe a deviation in the power spectrum of Unruh radiation from the standard Bose–Einstein and Fermi–Dirac distributions, respectively, due to the presence of the frame independent length scale of DSR. We further show that this deviation results in the modification of Unruh temperature which then depends non-linearly on the proper acceleration in DSR.
We study the phenomenon of spontaneous scalarization in parameterized Schwarzschild-like black holes. Two metrics are considered, the Konoplya–Zhidenko metric and the Johannsen–Psaltis metric. While these metrics can mimic the Schwarzschild black hole well in the weak-field regime, they have deformed geometries in the near-horizon strong-field region. Such deformations notably influence the emergence of tachyonic instability and subsequent spontaneous scalarization, enabling a clear distinction between these parameterized metrics and the standard Schwarzschild metric. These results suggest a possible way to test the parameterized black holes and thus the Kerr hypothesis by observing the phenomenon of spontaneous scalarization.
Recently, Zhang et al. constrained the Yukawa correction in the general free scalar–tensor gravity by borrowing the measured values of the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameters\(\gamma -1=(2.1\pm 2.3)\times 10^{-5}\)and\(\beta -1=(-\,4.1\pm 7.8)\times 10^{-5}\)in the Solar System tests. They firstly defined two PPN parameters\(\gamma (r)\)and\(\beta (r)\)in the gravity, which depend on the radial distancerand include the Yukawa-type parameters. Then, by comparing between the experiments’ results of two PPN parameters and their\(\gamma (r)\)and\(\beta (r)\), the authors claimed that they gave the tightest bound on the gravity by the Cassini tracking experiment. However, we find their approach is not rigorous. In this paper, corresponding astronomical experiments have been physically modelled by considering the lightlike and the timelike geodesics in the general free scalar–tensor gravity. Contrary to the wrong results in Zhang et al.’s work, it is shown that the Cassini tracking experiment is insensitive to the general free scaler–tensor gravity. Furthermore, we also find that the time delay and the light deflection are all independent of the gravity. Due to an additional Yukawa-type advance in the periastron shift, we derive very much improved bounds on the Yukawa-type parameters of this gravity.
In an accreting X-ray pulsar, a neutron star accretes matter from a companion star through an accretion disk. The magnetic field of the rotating neutron star disrupts the inner edge of the disk, funnelling the gas to flow onto the poles on its surface. Hercules X-1 is a prototypical persistent X-ray pulsar about 7 kpc from Earth. Its emission varies on three distinct timescales: the neutron star rotates every 1.2 s, it is eclipsed by its companion each 1.7 d, and the system exhibits a superorbital period of 35 d, which has remained stable since its discovery. Several lines of evidence point to the source of this variation as the precession of the accretion disk or that of the neutron star. Despite the many hints over the past 50 yr, the precession of the neutron star itself has yet not been confirmed or refuted. X-ray polarization measurements (probing the spin geometry of Her X-1) with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer suggest that free precession of the neutron star crust sets the 35 d period; this has the important implication that its crust is somewhat asymmetric by a few parts per ten million.
Cosmological models can be studied effectively using dynamical systems techniques. Starting from Brown’s formulation of the variational principle for relativistic fluids, we introduce new types of couplings involving a perfect fluid, a scalar field, and boundary terms. We describe three different coupling models, one of which turns out to be particularly relevant for cosmology. Its behaviour is similar to that of models in which dark matter decays into dark energy. In particular, for a constant coupling, the model mimics well-known dynamical dark energy models while the non-constant couplings offer a rich dynamical structure, unseen before. We are able to achieve this richness whilst working in a two-dimensional phase space. This is a significant advantage which allows us to provide a clear physical interpretation of the key features and draw analogies with previously studied models.
The neutrinophilic two Higgs doublet model is one of the simplest models to explain the origin of tiny Dirac neutrino masses. This model introduces a new Higgs doublet with eV scale VEV to naturally generate the tiny neutrino masses. Depending on the same Yukawa coupling, the neutrino oscillation patterns can be probed with the dilepton signature from the decay of charged scalar\(H^\pm \). For example, the normal hierarchy predicts BR\((H^+\rightarrow e^+\nu )\ll \)BR\((H^+\rightarrow \mu ^+\nu )\approx \)BR\((H^+\rightarrow \tau ^+\nu )\simeq 0.5\)when the lightest neutrino mass is below 0.01 eV, while the inverted hierarchy predicts BR\((H^+\rightarrow e^+\nu )/2\simeq \)BR\((H^+\rightarrow \mu ^+\nu )\simeq \)BR\((H^+\rightarrow \tau ^+\nu )\simeq 0.25\). By precise measurement of BR\((H^+\rightarrow \ell ^+\nu )\), we are hopefully to probe the lightest neutrino mass and the atmospheric mixing angle\(\theta _{23}\). Through the detailed simulation of the dilepton signature and corresponding backgrounds, we find that the 3 TeV CLIC could discover\(M_{H^+}\lesssim 1220\)GeV for NH and\(M_{H^+}\lesssim 1280\)GeV for IH. Meanwhile, the future 100 TeV FCC-hh collider could probe\(M_{H^+}\lesssim 1810\)GeV for NH and\(M_{H^+}\lesssim 2060\)GeV for IH.
We present results from fitting p-mode spectra derived from 7-d segments of Sun-as-a-star helioseismic observations from the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network covering 32 yr. The results show a clear dependence of the mode frequencies on solar activity, and the frequency dependence of the sensitivity to activity can also be seen. Because we use data segments that cover less than half of a solar rotation, we are able to test for the effect of activity on the solar far side. By fitting with a model that takes into account activity on the far side of the Sun, we show that the frequency shifts are sensitive to activity from the whole Sun, not just the side facing the observer. Our results suggest that there is potential to investigate activity-related asteroseismic frequency shifts in solar-like oscillators using short time series of observations.
This paper presents a classification framework for the architectures of planetary systems based on a complete survey of the confirmed exoplanet population. With nearly 6000 confirmed exoplanets discovered, including more than 300 multiplanet systems with three or more planets, the current observational sample has reached the point where it is both feasible and useful to build a classification system that divides the observed population into meaningful categories. This framework provides a criterion to split planetary systems into inner and outer regimes, and then further divides inner systems into dynamical classes. The resulting categories include "peas-in-a-pod systems" with uniformly small planets and "warm Jupiter systems" with a mix of large and small planets, as well as "closely-spaced systems" and "gapped systems," with further subdivisions based on the locations of gaps and other features. These categories can classify nearly all of the confirmed systems with three or more planets with minimal ambiguity. We qualitatively examine the relative prevalence of each type of system, subject to observational selection effects, as well as other notable features such as the presence of hot Jupiters. A small number of outlier systems are also discussed. Potential additional classes of systems yet to be discovered are proposed.
