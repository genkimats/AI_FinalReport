- create a baseline model (normal machine learning model)
- finetuning (k-fold)
- need to have a activation function (soft-max is okay)
- sigmoid only for binary case

- k-fold why?
- Divided and evaluated as an average. Cannot select one model for usage.
- At some point all data are used for training and testing.
- More realistic for the actual performance.

- have five confusion matrix but aggregate them into one (in the form of percentage or ratio)

- removed word "study"
- astronomy: 157
- psychology: 407
- sociology: 332
